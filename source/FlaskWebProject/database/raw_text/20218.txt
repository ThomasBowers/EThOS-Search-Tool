Abstract 
A particular version of Rwandas pre-colonial Iron Age past was constructed during 
colonial rule and influenced by a racial world-view. This ethnicised and racialised 
past was used by successive Rwandan rulers to divide the population along 
newcomer/latecomer lines and eventually became a central tenet of the propaganda 
that contributed to the genocide in Rwanda in 1994. More recently this racial 
presentation of Rwandas past has since been successfully deconstructed by social 
historians such as Mamdani (2002), Chrtien (2003), Eltringham (2004) Vansina 
(2004 and Newbury (2009), and has been shown to be a heavily biased construction 
based on colonial values. Yet, the ethno-racial presentation of the past continues to 
be problematic for history education in Rwanda.  
This thesis follows on from the work of these authors. It suggests that archaeology 
can usefully engage with contemporary political contexts, involving the 
deconstruction and reconstruction of Rwandas pre-colonial past in a climate of 
reconciliation. Following this introduction this thesis explores the concept of ethnicity 
in relation to Rwandan archaeology before reconsidering the tangible evidence for the 
Iron Age in Rwanda through a critical review of the existing literature. Furthermore, 
through the application of a politically aware and sensitive theoretical and 
methodological framework, this thesis explores non-ethno-racial historical narratives 
in pre-colonial Rwanda through a new body of archaeological data generated during 
twelve months of recent fieldwork in southern, central and northern Rwanda. Finally 
this thesis concludes with a summary of the archaeological outcomes of this research 
and some speculation on future research directions.

Chapter One 
Archaeology, Politics and the Contested Past: 
background and objectives 
Archaeology is not a discipline that is simply concerned with the past per se, but is 
also involved with the way in which the present constructs itself through its use of 
the past (Jones 1997: x). This issue has particular salience in a Rwandan context 
because as a colonial state, independent nation and post-genocide country, each 
ruling group has explicitly returned to the pre-colonial past to legitimate the 
contemporary power structure in the country (for a discussion see Mamdani 2002; 
Pottier 2002; Eltringham 2004; Freedman et al. 2009). However, the examples drawn 
upon have rarely been based on tangible data. Instead they have been founded on 
uncritical manipulations of the oral traditions (e.g. Kagame 1947, 1961, 1972; 
Hiernaux 1956; Maquet 1961).  
Today, this situation continues as the government of Rwanda seek to promote their 
version of events as an official single historical narrative (e.g. Freedman et al 2006). 
However, unlike their predecessors who drew upon colonial historical constructions 
to legitimate social division along ethno-racial lines (Des Forges 1999: 31), the 
current government are seeking to foster reconciliation by highlighting social 
cohesion and uniformity in pre-colonial times, as a consequence becoming actively 
involved with the devaluation of pre-colonial social identities such as Tutsi, Hutu 
and Twa in favour of more socially inclusive historical groups such as clans 
(Buckley-Zistel 2009: 46; Freedman et al. 2009: 676) (discussed in Chapter 2). Yet, 
despite these laudable efforts at reconciliation, it would be nave to suggest that the 
present government are not also legitimating their own rule by devaluing ethnic 
imbalances in the current government (Buckley-Zistel 2009: 47). 
Nevertheless, the vast majority of the governments narrative has received academic 
backing from social historians working outside of Rwanda (Freedman et al. 2009: 
676) who have deconstructed colonial ethno-racial presentations of society through a 
critical comparison of court and non-court oral traditions (e.g. Chretin 2002; 
Vansina 2004; Newbury 2009). However, the social historical approach has 
questioned the promotion of one history above all others and instead has 
highlighted a range of complex and dynamic historical processes that took place in 
pre-colonial Rwanda (e.g. Newbury 2009: xxxi) (discussed in Chapter 3 section 3.1). 
Thus, promoting a multi-narrative approach to the past and a celebration of the 
heterogeneity of Rwandan pre-colonial society, in comparison to the narrow 
homogeneity suggested by the government. Although the governments position is 
understandable as it seeks to prevent identity-based conflicts that blighted Rwanda 
in the 20th century from reappearing in the 21st century, educationalists have 
expressed dissatisfaction with this approach because by marginalising non-official 
histories they may create resentment, leading to social fracturing instead of the 
intended integration (Buckley-Zistel 2009: 31; Freedman et al. 2009: 677) (discussed 
in Chapter 2 section 2.5). 
Unfortunately, archaeology is yet to play an explicit role within this contested 
ground. Sixteen years since the end of the genocide there has been virtually no new 
archaeological fieldwork in Rwanda (exceptions include Humphris 2008 recent 
archaeometallurgical research, Simonets 2004 very brief excavations and the 
research presented here). Moreover, when archaeologists have discussed Rwanda 
(e.g. Van Grunderbeek et al. 2001; Van Grunderbeek and Roche 2007; Craddock et al. 
2009) they have confined themselves to academic debate and avoided direct 
engagement with the colonial construction of history and the contemporary official 
narrative. However, it is the contention of this thesis that archaeology as a discipline 
has massive potential for the exploration of the contested past and therefore has an 
important role to play within a reconciliation context in post-genocide Rwanda.  
Thus, the first challenge for this thesis will be the justification of the employment of 
archaeology in a social context that is still affected by the aftermath of identity-based 
conflict and the horrors of genocide. This will be achieved through a discussion of 
archaeologys chequered relationship with politics (Chapter 1) and through an 
exploration of the contemporary context of research in Rwanda and the potential 
application of archaeological information (Chapter 2). 
Indeed a large body of archaeological data already exists for Rwanda because prior 
to the cessation of research in the late 20th century, Rwanda received relatively 
intense archaeological attention (e.g. Hiernaux and Maquet 1957, 1960; Nenquin 
1967a, 1967b; Hiernaux 1968; Van Noten 1972, 1979, 1983). However, the 
archaeological interpretations produced during this period are problematic today 
because they are essentially colonial in nature (for a notable example see the work of 
Van Grunderbeek et al 1983). For example, they have unwittingly reproduced the 
colonial ethno-racial explanations of Rwandan society that eventually contributed to 
genocidal ideologies and remain an obstacle to reconciliation today (Hintjens 2008: 
241). Thus, the next challenge for this thesis will be the development of an 
archaeology that does not reproduce genocidal ideologies but generates 
interpretations that are not only archaeologically sound but also useful within post-
genocide Rwanda (Chapters 3 and 4). This will ultimately be achieved through the 
development and implementation of an informed, politically sensitive methodology 
(Chapter 5), which will allow for a critical reconsideration of the extant 
archaeological resources (Chapters 6 to 8) alongside the identification and 
contextualisation of new ones (Chapter 9).       
This chapter will now present a case for a politically aware archaeology in Rwanda 
by first discussing the changing role of archaeology over the 20th century, with brief 
examples from western archaeological theory that demonstrate the continual 
interplay between archaeology and politics. Second it will discuss archaeologys role 
in contested pasts with a famous example from the Indian city of Ayodhya. Third, it 
will discuss the relationship between archaeology and politics in Africa and will 
focus on two prominent examples from sub-Saharan Africa: Great Zimbabwe and 
South Africa. These brief case studies, whilst not directly politically related to 
Rwanda, are believed to be of relevance as examples of archaeological engagement 
with identity-based conflicts. 
This chapter will demonstrate that a relationship between archaeology and politics, 
whilst problematic, is unavoidable. Thus, archaeologists should engage with the 
political context of their research both in order to conduct it sensitively in regard to 
the needs of the countries in which they work, but also to help constrain or direct the 
political use of their data and interpretations.  
Following this discussion the chapter will relate these issues to Rwanda before 
briefly describing the background to the project, the collaborators and the structure 
of the thesis. 
1.1 The Role of Archaeology 
 The past does not exist  
(Reid and Lane 2004: 1) 
As Lane and Reid suggest, the past does not exist. Instead reconstructions of the past 
exist in the present based on varying interpretations of texts, languages, artefacts 
and landscapes amongst other sources. Archaeology is a tool, like history, that has 
been developed to aid the interpretation of these sources and to help reconstruct the 
past in the present. Thus, both history and archaeology face the same 
epistemological challenges: how do we link the present in which 
artefacts/documents are perceived and experienced, and the past in which they 
were made and used (McIntosh 2005: 52).  
The challenge of interpretation is central to archaeology, and the way in which 
archaeologists interpret the past include a variety of dynamic perspectives. Histories 
of archaeology commonly record three major 20th century interpretative trends in 
western archaeological theory: culture-history, processualism and post-
processualism (e.g. Trigger 1989). These interpretative trends also follow changes in 
the role of archaeology and have all been influenced by shifts in external political 
perspectives in society alongside internal archaeological debate.  
For example, culture-history developed within archaeology partly because of the 
growing awareness of geographical variability in the archaeological record. Thus, 
culture-historians attempted to describe and classify archaeological materials, and 
map material cultural traits, in order to identify discreet cultural groups in the past 
and thus retrace the various histories of living and extinct peoples (e.g. Childe 1929; 
1935). For culture history then the role of archaeology was to describe difference in 
the past based on nationalisms. However, external political influences, such as a 
growing sense of nationalism and racism in western and central Europe, which 
promoted ethnic groups as the defining unit in human history, were also central to 
the success of culture-history (Trigger 1989: 211).  
Culture-history came under attack in the 1950s and 1960s with the rise of a 
processual approach advocated by New Archaeology that believed the role of 
archaeology was not simply to describe the past, but to ask questions of it, and to try 
to understand how and why communities were manifested as they were (e.g. 
Binford 1962, 1965; Clark 1968). Processualism removed itself from the historical 
particularism of culture history to answer larger questions about the mechanics of 
society often producing grand meta-theories. This loss of innocence (Clarke 1973) 
brought archaeology more firmly within the realms of anthropology and the social 
sciences and represented a dramatic shift in the role of the discipline. Archaeologys 
purpose was no longer to separate and describe human history by ethnicity based on 
material culture traits, instead it emphasised cross-cultural regularities and general 
unifying processes (Trigger 1989: 393). However, like culture-history, processualism 
was also influenced by external political changes. For example, Hall (1996: 127) 
suggests the shift towards the appreciation of cultural similarities instead of 
differences can be traced to the growing rejection of racism after the racial atrocities 
of the 2nd World War.  
Processualisms belief in the inherent predictability and similarity of societies and 
their adaptive trajectories received criticism in the 1980s because it reduced the 
potential for human innovation and thus denied agency (Johnson 1999: 204). In a 
post-colonial, multi-cultural environment in which all cultures were viewed to be 
unique and valuable in their own right, cultural evolutionary models, associated 
with processualism, were viewed as being ethnocentric and morally untenable 
(Trigger 1989: 449). Again, external political influence altered the way in which 
archaeology was conducted. Thus, the 1980s saw the emergence of the post-
processual school of thought, which suggested the role of archaeology was to 
investigate the multiple pasts and identities that made up societies, often by 
reverting to historical specificity and detail (e.g. Hodder 1985). One facet of post-
processualism was the idea that whilst archaeology strived for objectivity it was 
inherently subjective, not simply because of the bias of the archaeological record, but 
also because of the biases of archaeologists themselves (e.g. Hodder 1984; Shanks 
and Tilley 1987: 10). Thus, not only was archaeologys purpose to investigate the 
variety of the human past, it was also to question its role and influences in the 
contemporary world in which archaeology is conducted.  
Whilst this historical summary is clearly a gross oversimplification, it does 
demonstrate that the role of archaeology has continued to change over the past 100 
years, both as a result of internal archaeological debate and external political forces. 
However, the role of archaeology has not changed uniformly over time. Indeed the 
practice of archaeology also depends on the tradition of the practitioner. Trigger 
(1984) has expressed this through an archaeological typology that divides 
archaeological research into one of three alternative archaeologies: nationalism, 
colonialism and imperialism. Trigger (1984: 356) suggests that each of these 
archaeologies produces a construction that reflects the political context in which it is 
practised. In Triggers model nationalist archaeologies tend to be practised by 
indigenous archaeologists, to glorify a national past and to have been sponsored by 
the state in which it is conducted; colonialist archaeologies tend to be practised by 
non-indigenous archaeologists who represent indigenous societies as static groups 
that only change through contact with external stimuli, thus legitimising colonial 
projects; finally, imperialist archaeologies are created by archaeologists working out 
of a few of the most influential states, e.g. world powers, who demonstrate and 
reinforce their imperial influence through broad sweeping archaeologies.  
Whilst Triggers (1984) typology has been both supported (e.g. Hall 1990) and 
challenged (e.g. Robertshaw 1990) the political nature of archaeology has not been 
disputed. Despite the extreme positivism of processualism, archaeology cannot be 
considered a scientifically objective discipline to the same degree as physics, 
chemistry or biology. Bias is influential at all stages of interpretation, and the time, 
place and thus political climate, in which research is conducted, is extremely 
important (Shepherd 2002: 193). These biases vary from practitioner to practitioner 
creating multiple interpretations of the same pasts, both complementary and 
conflicting.  
1.2 The Contested Past 
The archaeologically and historically recovered past can be considered 
contested territory (Arnold 1999: 1)  
As Arnold suggests, the reconstructed past is constantly disputed by competing 
presentations, often based on differing interpretations of the same evidence. These 
disputes may be led by a variety of different interest groups, with varying agendas, 
who may exist within the same academic discipline, with competing disciplines, or 
in the public, non-academic sphere. Thus, the past is a contested space and 
archaeology cannot avoid dealing with the politics inherent in these debates.  
The relationship between politics and archaeology has often been cited negatively. 
The use of ethnocentric archaeological data and interpretations (e.g. Kossina 1911) 
by Nazi Germany to promote its own racial worldview is just one example (Arnold 
1990: 121). However, the relationship between politics and archaeology is not 
straightforward and cannot simply be avoided because it is perceived to be 
dangerous and undesirable. An example that demonstrates some of the complexities 
surrounding this debate is the case of Ayodhya, India (Bernbeck and Pollock 1996: 
138-142).  
In 1992, based on a historical account, Hindu militants destroyed a 16th century 
mosque at Ayodhya because they believed there were traces of an important Hindu 
temple beneath it (Bernbeck and Pollock 1996: 138). The conflict surrounding the site 
had been ongoing since independence and this was the latest most violent escalation. 
Before 1992 both parties evoked archaeological evidence because in the absence of 
suitable historical documentation there were no other appropriate sources available. 
Three sets of archaeological excavations were undertaken, producing a variety of 
conflicting interpretations, none of which were considered conclusive by both sides 
(Bernbeck and Pollock 1996: 139). Unfortunately, although for a significant period 
conflict was contained within academia, in 1992 hundreds lost their lives as violent 
riots erupted.  
By 1994 archaeological involvement had become so problematic at Ayodhya that 
despite the World Archaeological Congress (WAC) taking place in Delhi during the 
second anniversary of the destruction of the mosque, WAC banned any discussion 
of Ayodhya in all forums at the congress (Bernbeck and Pollock 1996: 139). Although 
clearly pressured into a decision by the threat of closure by the state government, 
Jack Golson the president of WAC released a statement agreeing with the Indian 
authorities that there should be no discussion of the Ayodhya issue because the 
practical consequences of discussing this issue would be beyond the Executives 
control, much to the disproval of many of the delegates (quoted in Colley 1995: 15). 
Bernbeck and Pollock (1996: 138) have suggested that by avoiding this politically 
heated topic WAC failed to aid the establishment of criteria by which to evaluate 
competing knowledge claims at Ayodhya. More generally, they suggest that the 
attempt to remove archaeology from the political arena is unacceptable because, in 
such an approach, there is no basis on which to challenge those versions of the past 
that contain racist, sexist, or other discriminatory interpretations (Bernbeck and 
Pollock 1996: 139). By withdrawing from the debate, WAC allowed one 
archaeological interpretation to be as good as another, instead of exposing the racism 
inherent in the militant argument that was using Ayodhya as a catalyst for anti-
Muslim violence (Bernbeck and Pollock 1996: 140).  
Regardless of the preferences of archaeologists, archaeology was evoked in the 
Ayodhya debate because it was clearly an extremely important source for both sides. 
However, through fear of engagement WAC organisers took a Pontius Pilate 
approach, washed their hands of the affair and freed others to interpret and present 
archaeology unhindered by professional criticism. Archaeology often exists in 
antagonistic fields and thus archaeologists must learn to engage with political debate 
or accept that interpretations of the past will instead be led by politicians (Starzmann 
et al. 2008: 354). 
The relationship between politics and archaeology in Africa is complex. Examples 
include the use of archaeology as a colonial science harnessed to subjugate African 
peoples and territories; the use of archaeology to justify colonial administration and 
population growth (e.g. see Holl 1990; de Maret 1990); the use of archaeology by 
African nationalists to fight against colonialism (e.g. Diop 1996); and finally, today 
the explicit interaction of archaeology and politics in the illicit trade of antiquities, 
identity issues, and the negotiation of material culture ownership (e.g Shaw 1997; 
Fontein 2006; see Shepherd 2002).  
The two case studies below demonstrate that whilst the involvement of archaeology 
in politics is always problematic, and sometimes negative, it can also have positive 
outcomes. Great Zimbabwe has been selected because it is a prominent African 
example of how archaeological interpretations, for better or worse, are unavoidably 
situated within their contemporary political context. However, it will not be 
returned to during this thesis. In contrast, the relationship between archaeology and 
apartheid has been selected because it is an example where archaeology has 
successfully been employed in a post-identity-based conflict situation to foster 
reconciliation. Thus, this example will help to direct this thesis as it explores the role 
of archaeology in post-conflict Rwanda (Chapter 2 section 2.5).  
1.3 Great Zimbabwe 
The history of interpretation at the site of Great Zimbabwe begins with wild debates 
concerning its external origins and possible relationship to Queen of Sheba and King 
Solomon myths, and historical peoples such as the Phoenicians (e.g. Bent 1896). 
Today, politics and debate continue to surround Great Zimbabwe. However, these 
are no-longer focused on external origins instead they are concerned with cultural 
ownership by various indigenous groups and heritage stakeholders (Fontein 2006).  
Early interpretations of Great Zimbabwe suggested that such an impressive 
structure could not have been built by a native population but must have been 
constructed by a non-African people (e.g. Hall 1909; Johnstone 1909; for a notable 
exception see David Randall-MacIver 1906). It was not until twenty years later that 
this perspective was seriously challenged in southern Africa by the scientific 
archaeological methods of Gertrude Caton-Thompson (1931). Caton-Thompson 
(1931), like MacIver (1906) before her, presented extensive evidence that disproved 
the claim that Great Zimbabwe had external origins. Caton-Thompsons results 
appear to be an example of how objective archaeological reasoning can slice 
through political bias to uncover the archaeological truth. However, neither 
Gertrude Caton-Thompson (1931), nor her predecessor MacIver (1906), escaped the 
political context of their research or the colonial views of their audience. Caton-
Thompson was renowned for her meticulous approach and was unlikely to 
misrepresent the clear stratigraphic evidence at Great Zimbabwe that indicated it 
was an indigenous achievement (Fontein 2006: 13). However, she was also a product 
of her times and influenced by her surroundings. Thus, in mitigation she, like 
MacIver, reduced the impact of her findings by suggesting that the achievement was 
childlike:  
The architecture at Zimbabwe, imitative apparently of a daub 
prototype, strikes me as essentially the product of an infantile mind, a 
pre-logical mind, a mind which having discovered the way of making or 
doing a thing goes on childishly repeating the performance regardless of 
incongruity. (Caton-Thompson 1931: 103; also famously cited in papers 
by Hall 1984 and Fontein 2006) 
Although Caton-Thompons findings had the potential to ignite a new agenda, 
which investigated and promoted African accomplishments, the persistence of 
colonialism and the lack of an African political voice prevented that. (Although from 
1965 until 1980 white settlers in Rhodesia made a Unilateral Declaration of 
Independence (UDI) from the United Kingdom and thus technically from this point 
the territory was no longer a colony). It was not until later, in a period of growing 
African independence and African nationalism, that Great Zimbabwe was harnessed 
for the purpose of promoting African independence. However, within Rhodesia, 
Great Zimbabwe continued to be presented as an exotic structure by white settlers 
(e.g. Bruwer 1965) and officials right up until Zimbabwe achieved independence in 
1980 (Shepherd 2002: 196; Fontein 2006: 8, 10). Recognising the powerful symbolic 
significance of Great Zimbabwe, the site was adopted as a symbol for African 
nationalism in the 1960s, subsequently being taken as the national symbol and name 
of the newly independent Zimbabwe in 1980, and actively promoted for nationalistic 
purposes within Zimbabwe in the preceding years (e.g. Mufuka 1983).   
Unfortunately, whilst the adoption of Great Zimbabwe by Zimbabwean nationalists, 
the independent state and later UNESCO, as a World Heritage Site, is in many 
respects positive, it is also a form of colonialism. As Fontein (2006: 9) suggests, today 
Great Zimbabwe has been colonised by the heritage profession and by the state for 
their own goals. The cultural ownership of the site by smaller indigenous 
stakeholder groups, who claim a historical link with Great Zimbabwe, has largely 
been ignored or silenced in favour of the greater good of archaeology, tourism and 
national politics.  
Great Zimbabwe is a very prominent and often cited example of the relationship 
between politics and archaeology in Africa (e.g. Trigger 1989: 197-201; Preucel 1995; 
Hall 1984; 1996; Shepherd 2002; Ranger 2004; Fontein 2006). The case demonstrates 
the complex and unavoidable relationship between archaeology and politics and 
suggests that whilst archaeology may inform politics, it is often external political 
pressures that change the role and impact of archaeology.  
1.4 Apartheid and Post-Apartheid Archaeology 
working with Iron Age materials  the last 2,000 years or so of a history 
then largely unwritten, and the patrimony of the majority of black South 
Africans  did make me realize that this sort of archaeology is always  
and inevitably  political in natureI found it difficult to understand 
 and still do so  how colleagues can argue that archaeological 
interpretation is above politics (Martin Hall interviewed by Lucas 
2006: 57-58). 
As Hall suggests, the history of archaeology in South Africa is a political history 
(also see Hall 1984: 455). For example, in the 1930s and 1940s archaeology was 
established in South Africa under the political patronage of Jan Smuts, head of the 
United Party, and sometime Prime Minister. However, it lost official patronage in 
1948 when the Afrikaner nationalists came to power on an apartheid ticket 
(Shepherd 2002: 197). Despite never returning to political favour, there was an 
archaeological resurgence in the 1960s and 70s based on increased university 
funding by the apartheid state and because, an archaeological service was seen as 
part of the essential cultural apparatus of a modernizing state (Shepherd 2002: 198). 
From that moment on archaeologists and the apartheid government were in the 
strange position of enjoying mutual loathing, but benefiting from the existence of 
each other. In response, some archaeologists challenged their economic masters, 
whilst others chose to avoid conflict. 
For example, many archaeologists working in South Africa under apartheid avoided 
contested ground by either investigating less controversial periods or by retreating 
into a technical world that was virtually inaccessible except to other archaeologists 
(Hall 1990: 63). However, some attempted to undermine the authority of the state 
sponsored version of history by looking for the origins of black communities. 
Nevertheless, Martin Hall (interviewed by Lucas 2006: 56) suggests that the 
apartheid state was too busy killing and jailing its opponents to worry about 
intellectual arguments. Furthermore, he suggests that the practice of any 
archaeology in the country actually gave the government a feeling of scientific 
normality and implied legitimacy. However, it is difficult to suggest that 
archaeologists should not have conducted academically sound research and 
challenged the apartheid government, or that they should have ceased to operate. 
For example, Hall (1990: 73) criticises the archaeologists who deliberately took 
archaeology under apartheid into obscurity to avoid political conflict, and points to 
the reaction against it by the Black Consciousness movement who in response 
resorted to an abstract, utopian vision of the pre-colonial past. Thus, by avoiding 
engagement, archaeologists allowed political groups to fill the interpretative 
vacuum.  
The most prominent clash between archaeology and apartheid outside of South 
Africa came when a series of events led up to the 1986 disinviting of South African 
and Namibian archaeologists from the first World Archaeological Congress (WAC) 
held in Southampton (Shepherd 2002: 201). Consequently, the International Union of 
Prehistoric and Proto-Prehistoric Societies withdrew its financial support for the 
congress and over 400 academics boycotted the event. The protest against apartheid 
by the organisers of WAC, led by Peter Ucko (1990), split archaeology into two 
groups, those that believed that academic free speech should be maintained at all 
costs (e.g. Crabtree 1988) and those that believed the apartheid regime was so 
abhorrent that academics working under apartheid should be stopped from 
attending (e.g. Ucko 1990). Today the actions of the organisers are seen as a 
principled and exonerated stand but at the time it was a complex and divisive issue 
(Shepherd 2002). For example, the disinvitation prevented many archaeologists 
from attending who were actually challenging the apartheid regime from within 
South Africa.  
In post-apartheid South Africa the role of archaeology has changed but it is still 
political. Today, although archaeology continues to be harnessed as a means to 
challenge the old racial official history, the emphasis has shifted to the investigation 
of South Africas multi-narrative past and the use of archaeology as a tool for 
reconciliation, for example in the field of education.  
Amanda Esterhuysen (2000: 159-65) has investigated the birth of educational 
archaeology in post-apartheid South Africa. Previously the politics of the past had 
been excluded from the classroom because the substance of archaeology; the 
evolution of humans, African and pre-colonial southern African history did not 
conform to the Christian Nationalist viewpoint, or conform to the governments 
values (Esterhuysen 2000: 161). However, in 1994, under the new ANC 
government, education was radically restructured to rid it of the racial dogma that 
previously defined it, and in 1995 South African archaeologists lobbied to have 
archaeology included in the new curriculum. They showed that the application of 
archaeology in the classroom was a powerful means of restoring the excluded past 
and providing pupils with the tools to challenge and deal with negative images of 
the past and associated racial, ethnic, and gender stereotypes created by the 
apartheid system (Esterhuysen 2000: 161). It helped to show how all peoples had 
contributed to the South African past and helped pupils to challenge the written 
record, opening up a range of sources (Esterhuysen 2000: 162). Furthermore, 
archaeology was also shown to be a valuable educational tool in its own right 
because it aided outcome based education, through site visits, and it helped to 
teach a variety of skills such as interpretation and the production of historical 
knowledge, the understanding of bias and the ability to question (Esterhuysen 2000: 
162). As Esterhuysen (2000: 162) concludes, educational archaeology, revitalises 
history, renews young peoples interest in their heritage and allows them to 
appreciate the importance of archaeology as a tool to unravelling the past.      
This section has introduced the unavoidable relationship between archaeology and 
politics and suggested the past is a contested territory that archaeology must actively 
negotiate. The following section will now relate the issues explored here to Rwanda.  
1.5 Archaeology, Rwanda and Identity-based-conflicts 
The past legitimates the present.  
(Arnold 1999: 1) 
Implicit in all of the examples given during this chapter is the suggestion that the 
past has been exploited to legitimise the present. For example, when Great 
Zimbabwe was interpreted as an exotic structure it was being used to legitimate an 
exotic colonial regime. However, since it was promoted as an indigenous structure it 
has been used to foster nationalist emotions. Today, in post-apartheid South Africa 
the past is being used to legitimate reconciliation through educational archaeology 
and by challenging racist narratives. In Rwanda the pre-colonial past has been 
manipulated to legitimate successive regimes, including the royal court, the colonial 
administration, the post-colonial government and today the post-genocide 
government (discussed in more detail in Chapter 2). However, as in South Africa, it 
is believed that a structured, politically aware approach to the Rwandan pre-colonial 
past can be beneficial and can foster reconciliation in post-conflict Rwanda.    
I believe that archaeologists can play a significant role in public 
discourse  in empowering public dialogues through providing a rich 
source of knowledge about the past.  
(Martin Hall interviewed by Lucas 2006: 58) 
The view expressed above by Martin Hall is consistent with the perspective of this 
research. Although Martin Halls work concerns southern Africa and specifically 
South Africa the author believes that the sentiment is no less appropriate to Rwanda, 
a country that has a very different history but has also suffered because of identity 
based conflicts in the 20th century. However, in order for archaeology to successfully 
achieve this in Rwanda it must engage fully with the political context by developing 
theoretical frameworks and methodologies that are both archaeologically legitimate 
and politically aware.  
The civil war and genocide in Rwanda was stopped in 1994 and although there were 
rebel incursions in the country in the late 1990s, internally the country has been 
largely peaceful for nearly 15 years. Whilst wars have continued in neighbouring 
DRC and Burundi, creating instability around some of Rwandas borders, the 
majority of Rwanda is safe and accessible for research. However, the legacy of 
conflict is still very visible in the Rwandan landscape both physically and mentally. 
Furthermore, this is continually reinforced by rebel groups operating close by 
outside of the country, the ongoing trials of genocidaires and public disputes over the 
governments version of events. Thus, in this sensitive climate it is extremely 
important to consider and engage with the political context of archaeological 
research in conflict/post-conflict Rwanda. 
In the following chapter (2), this thesis will establish the nature of the contested past 
in Rwanda and the potential of incorporating educational archaeology within the 
secondary school education system. It is not the purpose of this research to 
deconstruct court, colonial, post-colonial, or post-genocide presentations of 
Rwandas pre-colonial past. This has already been successfully and extensively 
achieved by others (e.g. Chrtien 2000; Mamdani 2002; Pottier 2002; Eltringham 2004; 
Vansina 2004; Newbury 2009), whose work will be discussed in Chapter 3. Neither is 
its purpose to uncritically follow and support the official single narrative of the 
current government. Instead this research will ask if it is possible to explore pre-
colonial, Iron Age pasts in Rwanda, in a manner that is sufficiently archaeologically 
viable, accountable and objective whilst also remaining sensitive to the 
contemporary context of research.  
The failure to conduct archaeological research in post-genocide Rwanda until now 
cannot simply be attributed to a lack of interest, funding, infrastructure or security. 
Indeed none of these factors have stopped other researchers, such as historians, 
journalists and environmentalists working there. Instead, it is suggested that 
archaeologists have not felt emotionally or politically able to engage with post-
Genocide Rwanda because of the nature of the identity-based conflict and the issues 
surrounding ethnicity. Yet in the meantime the pre-colonial past continues to be 
appropriated by competing political regimes. Furthermore, reconciliation is being 
hampered because there is no negotiation of the pre-colonial past, on which 
genocidal propaganda was built, in secondary school education. Thus, in response, 
this research will develop a non-ethno-racial approach to archaeology that is specific 
to the context of Rwanda but may be adapted and applied to other broadly similar 
post-identity based conflicts, such as in neighbouring Burundi 
Thus, in Chapter 3 this research will demonstrate that ethnicity, as a concept that has 
been applied to social groups in 20th century Rwanda, may not be applicable to pre-
colonial Rwanda. Issues of ethnicity are difficult to discuss in contemporary 
Rwanda. For example, the government has passed a law against divisionism, 
which effectively prevents discussion of an individuals ethnicity (Buckley-Zistel 
2009: 46). However, ethnicity is difficult to discuss as a pre-colonial Rwandan 
identity for very different reasons. For example social historians suggest that pre-
colonial identities were complex, often ambiguous, overlapping, social groups that 
shared a single language, lived in mixed communities and were sub-divided along 
many different lines, such as lineage and clan, and not just Tutsi, Hutu and Twa (e.g. 
Vansina 2004: 198-200). Therefore, the contemporary definition of ethnicity must be 
adapted or the term rejected in relation to pre-colonial Rwanda.   
Furthermore, whilst archaeologists such as de Maret (2005) have been able to go 
from Pottery Groups to Ethnic Groups in neighbouring DRC, this is not possible in 
all archaeological examples (Jones 1997: 107). De Marets (2005) ethnic groups relate 
to separate kingdoms and polities, with separate, and historically demonstrable, 
material culture traits. However, in Rwanda, Hutu, Tutsi and Twa were mixed 
within a single kingdom and shared a similar material culture. Furthermore, these 
terms were constantly changing and do not necessarily have a one to one 
relationship with particular subsistence economies as they came to be understood in 
the late 19th and early 20th centuries (Vansina 2004: 198). Thus, the possibility of 
identifying these identities in the archaeological record is negligible. 
1.6 Background to Research 
This research was first inspired in 2003, whilst conducting MA research in Uganda, 
after conversations with Rwandan expatriates living in Uganda who expressed a 
desire for the pre-colonial archaeology of Rwanda to be reinvestigated. A brief 
reconnaissance trip to Rwanda was made in 2004 and a longer preliminary research 
trip was made in 2005 where research proposals were presented to the Institute 
National Muse de Rwanda (INMR). The PhD element of this research began in 
October 2005 and the first fieldwork season was initiated in October 2006.  
1.7 Research Participants  
The fieldwork for this research was undertaken with the permission of Professor 
Celestin Kanimba Misago, the director of the INMR. Elements of the fieldwork were 
carried out alongside Jane Humphris (UCL) archaeometallurgical PhD research (see 
Humphris 2008) but all of the field survey and excavations were managed and 
directed by the author (Giblin 2008). Fieldwork staff taken from the National 
University of Rwanda, the INMR, the British Institute in Eastern Africa and 
volunteers from international universities including UCL, Oxford and Newcastle, 
assisted the research. The ceramic analysis was conducted by the author, with advice 
from Dr Ceri Ashley (UCL), the zooarchaeological analysis was conducted by the 
author with supervision from Dr Andrew Reid (UCL) and the palaeobotanical 
analysis was conducted by Dr Dorian Fuller (UCL) with assistance by the author. 
The archaeometallurgical analysis of the grave goods was conducted by Jane 
Humphris (UCL) and the human remains analysis was conducted by Dr Anna 
Clement (UCL).    
1.8 Structure of Thesis 
Following on from the themes introduced in this chapter, the early chapters will 
contextualise this research within relevant political issues and will focus on more 
detailed reviews of extant work. Chapter 2 will situate the reader within the context 
of past historical presentations in Rwanda and the negative impact they have had on 
identity-based conflicts in the 20th century, and how these continue to problematise 
the past and present in Rwanda today. Chapter 3 will examine how social historians 
have already deconstructed these pasts and how their work has highlighted new 
ways to approach pre-colonial Rwanda. It will then explore the archaeological 
theoretical and conceptual successes and failures of Rwandan archaeology, and will 
develop a new theoretical framework with which to approach Rwandan archaeology 
that is sensitive to the identity-based conflicts that have occurred in the country 
whilst also remaining archaeologically vigorous. Through a critical review of the 
extant archaeological data, regarding the Iron Age in Great Lakes Africa and 
specifically Rwanda, Chapter 4 will identify a series of pertinent research questions 
that follow the theoretical framework set out in the previous chapter.  
The second set of chapters relate to the data generated by this research and the 
fieldwork and analytical methodology. Thus, Chapter 5 develops a research 
methodology for the investigation of the research themes, objectives and questions 
identified in the previous review chapters. Following on from the methodology 
chapter the next three chapters deal with the results of the fieldwork and subsequent 
analysis carried out in Rwanda and London between October 2006 and March 2009, 
split into geographic case studies. Chapter 6 presents the results from southern 
Rwanda, Chapter 7 presents the results from central Rwanda and Chapter 8 presents 
the results from northern Rwanda.  
Chapter 9 will draw these results together by detailing the relevant evidence from 
these combined geographic research zones before contextualising these within the 
extant archaeological issues, and directly tackling the research themes, objectives 
and questions identified in earlier chapters. Finally Chapter 10 will briefly review 
the data and return to the goals set out at the start of this document in Chapter 1, 
discussing research outcomes that have already taken place, before making some 
suggestions for future research and initiatives relevant to this work.  
Chapter 2 
Rwandas Pre-Colonial Past: 
20th Century Ethno-Racial Presentations  
This chapter will describe how 20th century racial presentations of Rwandas pre-
colonial past were constructed as a consequence of colonisation and colonial 
attitudes to African society, and their interpretation of elite African power structures 
and strategies of power. It also describes how this racial historical construction was 
reproduced throughout the 20th century by successive administrations and how it 
contributed to 20th century conflict in Rwanda culminating in the 1994 genocide. 
Furthermore, it will describe how this construction continues to be problematic in 
contemporary Rwanda, for example in the realm of historical education, thus 
establishing a premise for the reinvestigation of Rwandas pre-colonial past.    
2.1 Geography and Demography  
Rwanda (157S 304E) is a landlocked nation in central Africa bordered by Uganda, 
Tanzania, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) (Fig. 2.1). Rwanda 
is the most densely populated country in sub-Saharan Africa with a population of 
over 10 million people (based on the CIA World Factbook) living in 23,338 sq km. 
The vast majority of this population are engaged in subsistence agriculture. The 
country ranges from savannah grassland in the east and south, to mountains and 
volcanoes in the west and north, rising from 950m above sea level at the Rusizi River 
basin to 4500m at the summit of Mount Karisimbi. However, most of the county is 
covered by large closely spaced hills and Rwanda is known as the pays de mille 
collines. During the 20th century in pre-Genocide Rwanda three social groups were 
recognised: Twa, Tutsi and the majority Hutu. During this time these identities were 
presented as racially defined groups that were believed to historically relate to 
opposing subsistence economies including hunter-gatherer, pastoral and agricultural 
lifestyles (e.g. Maquet 1961). Today, Rwandas post-genocide government are 
involved in the eradication of any identity-based divisionism and do not promote 
the use of these terms but prefer to highlight the historical unity of all Rwandans 
(Shyaka 2006: 33-35; Buckley-Zistel 2009: 46).

2.2 Late 19th Century History  
The Kingdom of Rwanda was well established by the 17th century under the ruling 
Nyiginya Dynasty (Vansina 2004: 44). (Although at this time the polity did not cover 
the whole of modern Rwanda). The Nyiginya Dynasty was taken from the Tutsi 
social group but the majority Hutu retained access to power through a range of high-
level positions within the armies and as clan chiefs (Vansina 2004: 75-76). However, 
in the years immediately preceding European contact at the end of the 19th century 
these institutions were gradually eroded to the benefit of Tutsi and to the detriment 
of Hutu. For example, the Tutsi monarchy had long recognised Hutu spiritual 
power, incorporating it in court rituals (ubiiru) conducted by Hutu ritualists (abiiru) 
whose knowledge the king (mwami) would consult to aid him in his decision making 
(Mamdani 2001: 64). However, although the Abiiru remained important during the 
17th and 18th century they were systematically weakened prior to and during the 
reign of Rwabugiri in the late 19th century (Mamdani 2001: 64). By the end of 
Rwabugiris rule, a once semi-autonomous Rwanda was divided into a well-
organized structure of provinces, districts, hills and neighbourhoods, and 
administered by a hierarchy of chiefs, of which the higher levels were 
predominantly occupied by Tutsi. 
Rwabugiri, who ruled Rwanda from 1860 to 1895, is remembered as the most 
despotic of Rwandas rulers and oversaw Rwandas most aggressive period of 
expansion. During Rwabugiris reign, Hutu and Tutsi became increasingly unequal 
social groups to an unprecedented extent as a result of changing patron-client 
relationships (Eltringham 2004: 13; Newbury 1978). Initially agricultural land 
ownership was dominated by Hutus, which was expressed by the word ubukonde, 
emphasising a lineages claim over the land it cleared. However, under Rwabugiri 
the concept of igikingi was introduced which emphasised land ownership as a 
political grant from the mwami. In return Hutu were required to complete ubureetwa, 
a form of forced labour (Mamdani 2001: 66). Despite social constructions that 
mitigated these developments, such as Hutu involvement in the administrative and 
military systems, Tutsi were increasingly associated with power and Hutu with 
political impotence (Mamdani 2001: 66-69).  
It was during the reign of Rwabugiri that Europeans first entered Rwanda. In the 
late 19th century the scramble for Africa was in full flight and control of Great 
Lakes Africa, and the source of the Nile, were major concerns for European powers 
(Chrtien 2003: 202-204; Pakenham 1990). In 1890 Rwanda was allocated to Germany 
leading the way for the first European explorer, Count von Gotzen, to enter Rwanda 
in 1894, although Rwanda did not submit to German rule until 1897 (Chrtien 2003: 
217-218). German power was short lived however, and in 1916, during World War I, 
Rwanda was occupied by Belgian forces and, despite a brief period of British 
administration, was formally turned over to Belgian rule in 1919 at the Treaty of 
Versailles, the Milner Convention, in Paris (Chrtien 2003: 260).  
When the Germans, and later the Belgians, arrived in Rwanda they encountered a 
society that was at its historically most unequal in terms of group socio-political 
status. A slow process of vertical social-differentiation taking place over hundreds of 
years had been radically accelerated under the regime of Rwabugiri and 
compounded in 1891 when a rinderpest epidemic killed many cattle and further 
concentrated wealth in the hands of the most powerful people with the largest herds, 
who were the most resistant to herd size reduction (Chrtien 2003: 252). Thus, the 
stratification encountered by the first Europeans in Rwanda was the result of a 
historically situated, dynamic process of social cleavage, accelerated in recent years 
under Rwabugiri. However, as a result of the pervading colonial ideology, European 
explorers, and later colonists, believed the socio-political situation in Rwanda to be a 
static natural formation built upon differences in racial origins and subsistence 
orientation.  
2.3 Historical Constructions in 20th Century Rwanda 
Since the early twentieth century, when Europeans first began recording Rwandas 
history, Rwandas past has been presented as a known entity, that is, a kingdom 
made up of three polarised socio-political, racial identities: Twa, Tutsi, and Hutu 
(Vansina 2004: 196-203). Such accounts constituted a distorted version of the modern 
state of Rwanda by presenting it as ancient, static and racially defined, and built on 
successive phases of migration, dominance and subsistence exclusivity (e.g. Maquet 
1961). Key to this polarised view of history was the transference of Rwandas 
modern territorial boundaries and socio-political relationships into representations 
of the ancient past. This discourse, in combination with the colonial imposition of 
ethnic identity cards in 1933, defined and labelled previously socially ambiguous 
categories in static and value-laden terms (Hintjens 2008: 253). The removal of fluid 
identities created rigid subsistence and racially based ethnicities that restricted social 
interaction and understanding. Thus, an authoritative construction was created, 
which was used to explain social inequalities in Rwanda through history and to 
legitimise successive political structures as they reproduced these divisions. As 
Eltringham (2004: 147) has observed, this appeal to history was central to the 
colonial and subsequent post-colonial construction of racial distinction, establishing 
the Hutu Republic and genocidal propaganda. Unfortunately, this historical 
construction has continued to persist even in relatively recent literature (e.g. 
Overdulve 1997; Sebasoni 2000). Despite the problems associated with this version of 
history, it is important not to reject it entirely because as a construct it is rooted in the 
Rwandan past. However, it should be recognised as a discourse generated in an era 
dominated by racial frameworks, which eternalised a particular situation, failing to 
recognise it is as a phase in a dynamic and complicated historical trajectory. This 
section will now describe how this historical construction was influenced by the 
pervading colonial ideology and how it was reproduced throughout the 20th century.  
Colonial ideology in Africa was built upon a concept of race and racial superiority 
that legitimised the domination of colonial subjects as it once legitimised the trans-
Atlantic slave trade (Mamdani 2001: 78). Racial thinking helped legitimate slavery, 
because it argued that Africans were less advanced, less evolved, and were thus less 
human. However, as more African achievements were discovered through 
exploration, this theory was brought into question and it became increasingly 
difficult to support. In order to explain African accomplishments authors such as 
Johnston (1902) and Seligman (1930) turned to the Hamitic Hypothesis, which 
suggested a race of Hamites, a pastoral sub-group of the Caucasian race superior to 
the Negroid Africans, were responsible for all the significant achievements in sub-
Saharan Africa.  
The Hamitic Hypothesis is a manipulation of the myth of Ham, the banished son 
of Noah. This myth has been reproduced many times over hundreds of years to 
justify the subjugation of different peoples. For example, the Israelites suggested that 
the Canaanites were descendents of the disgraced Ham, which justified domination 
by the Israelites. Later during the Atlantic slave trade this myth was harnessed in a 
similar way to dehumanise all sub-Saharan Africans, denigrating them as 
descendants of Ham (Sanders 1969; Mamdani 2001). Although this belief fell out of 
fashion during the Enlightenment, the hypothesis was revived with Napoleons 
invasion of Egypt in 1798 (Sanders 1969: 524). Napoleons invasion introduced 
French archaeologists and scientists to the Nile civilisations, whose discoverys 
created two problems: first, Negroid descendents of Ham were not believed 
capable of such accomplishments and second if Noah had cursed Ham how could 
the earlier Hamites have achieved such highly original achievement (Sanders 1969: 
525). In response to this conundrum biblical scholars re-interpreted the Bible and 
found that it was Canaan and not Ham that had been cursed. Others proposed that 
the Negroids were not direct descendants of Ham and instead the Hamites were 
actually white Caucasoid (Sanders 1969: 527). Thus, cultural accomplishments 
encountered in Africa were removed from the Negro and were transferred solely to 
the Caucasoid Hamites (Sanders 1969: 521). In order to explain the lack of a 
contemporary Caucasoid race in sub-Saharan Africa, it was suggested that as the 
Hamites had travelled further south into the continent they had been corrupted and 
assimilated within the Negroid race (Mamdani 2001: 82-83). However, where 
Europeans encountered African societies that they considered to be complex they 
suggested that these were the living remnants of the civilising influence of the 
Hamites. Thus, when Europeans encountered the politically complex kingdoms of 
Rwanda, Burundi and Karagwe, amongst others in Great Lakes Africa, they quickly 
came to believe their pastoral rulers to be descendants of the Hamites. The Hamite 
construction was fully integrated into Great Lakes Africa histories produced by 
Europeans, as demonstrated by this example:  
Bimanuka lived in the same period as Basita, the first Hamite Kings 
who reigned in Bunyoro around 1000-1100. Bimanuka were not related 
to Basita, but they were Hamites like them. They managed to escort and 
follow them, with their cattle with long horns, from the upper Nile 
towards the centre of Africa in the search for bigger pastures. When 
Basita settled in Bunyoro, Bimanuka progressed towards the south and 
through Nkole and Mpororo, they reached Rwanda in 
Umutara.(Delmas 1950) 
In Rwanda, pastoral Tutsi elites from the ruling dynasty, with their distinctive tall, 
thin physical appearance and their long straight noses, were likened to the 
Hamitic Ethiopians. Thus, the Tutsi appeared to Europeans to be a product of a 
superior, alien, Hamitic race living amongst the short indigenous and inferior 
Hutu Negros whom they must have conquered prior to establishing the Nyiginya 
Kingdom, the Antecedents to Modern Rwanda (Vansina 2004).  
This hypothesis helped legitimise the European colonial agenda, by providing a 
colonial precedent. In other words, if earlier alien races (i.e. Tutsi) had migrated, 
conquered and brought progression to Rwanda then the path was open for 
Europeans to do much the same. Thus the Belgian administration and the Catholic 
Church constructed a system of indirect rule based on the racial premise of the 
Hamitic Hypothesis (Mamdani 2001: 87-88). The Belgians would decide the 
policies and the supposedly racially superior Tutsi minority would impose them on 
the racially inferior Hutu majority. This situation was unique to Rwanda and 
Burundi. Whilst other ethnic groups in Great Lakes Africa were identified as 
Hamites, such as the Bahima, they were not given institutionalised superior status 
(Mamdani 2001: 43-35). Between 1927 and 1936 this ethnic separation was achieved 
in Rwanda by the systematic racialisation of education, administration, taxation, 
religion and finally the population (Mamdani 2001: 88). Initially in education there 
was a straightforward policy of favouring Tutsi elites, but later specialist schools 
were set up to teach Tutsi to administrate and Hutu to labour (Chrtien 2003: 273-4; 
Mamdani 2001: 89). This created a wealth of able Tutsi to fill the new administrative 
positions created by the Belgian resident Georges Mortehan, who in 1925-26 
removed the three-chief system, a hierarchy that had incorporated both Hutu and 
Tutsi chiefs, and replaced it with a Tutsified two-tier system. This drastically 
reduced Hutu presence in the ruling group (Chrtien 2003: 270-71; Mamdani 2001). 
The situation was worsened by colonial taxes imposed on Hutu agriculturalists, in 
order to make them grow particular crops and undertake forced labour (Mamdani 
2001: 94-98). This further shifted the burden of the client-patron relationship away 
from elites and towards the poor, altering a more reciprocal relationship to one 
based upon coercion (Chrtien 2003: 272). Social identity was ultimately and fully 
polarised with the official census of 1933-34 that gave every Rwandan an official 
identity card, detailing amongst other things their ethnie or ubwoko, the latter being 
the Kinyarwanda term meaning mono-dimensional identity (Eltringham 2004: 18; 
Mamdani 2001: 98-99). In this case ethnie equated to racial difference manifested in 
physical characteristics and subsistence orientation. Ethnie was identified through 
the measurement of particular anatomical features alongside subsistence practice. 
For example, an individual with a large number of cattle could be considered Tutsi 
whether or not they were also involved in agriculture. This resulted in the splitting 
up of families whose members displayed a variety of anatomical proportions and 
who had disproportionate access to cattle. Never before in Rwanda had Tutsi, Twa, 
and Hutu been officially understood as races whose identity could be reduced to 
biological factors (Mamdani 2001: 80).  
Although there were rebellions against Belgian rule by both Hutu and Tutsi 
(Chrtien 2003: 298), the racial ideology permeated, and was adopted, throughout 
society. Hutu were believed to be an indigenous race and Tutsi an alien one. This is 
perhaps best illustrated in the works of Alexis Kagame (1947, 1952, 1954: 55-56, 1959, 
1972, 1975: 27-28); a court ideologue who was both subject and analyst and who 
promoted the idea that Tutsi had Ethiopian and Hamitic origins. To Kagame and 
other elite Tutsi, it was an advantage to be an alien race because their racial 
superiority justified the subjugation of the Hutu. However, at independence the 
influence of this ideology was to be reversed in favour of the Hutu majority. It was 
adopted by Hutu intellectuals and was presented in the Bahutu Manifesto, Notes on 
the Social Aspect of the Racial Native Problem in Rwanda (reproduced in Eltringham 
2004: 19). However, the emphasis of Hutu racial ideology was not foreign 
superiority, but indigenous legitimacy. The same set of principles that justified 
independence from European colonisers was now used against the foreign Tutsi. 
At independence, the vast numerical majority of the Hutu won them power in 
multiparty elections and they set about reversing racial policies. Thus, by 1973 there 
was a ten per cent quota established to restrict the presence of Tutsi in schools, 
alongside similar policies in the professional sphere (Eltringham 2004: 21).  
The racially constructed past continued to haunt Rwanda prior to and during the 
1994 Genocide. As described by Des Forges (1999: 31): 
Organizers of the genocide, who had themselves grown up with . . . 
distortions of history, skillfully exploited misconceptions about who the 
Tutsi were, where they had come from, and what they had done in the 
past. From these elements, they fueled the fear and hatred that made 
genocide imaginable. (Quoted in Freedman et al 2009: 663)  
The construction was repeated in popular publications with Hutu nationalist 
sympathies, such as Kangura and La Medaille Nyiramacibiri, and in the broadcasts 
of Radio Television Libre Des Mille Collines (RTLM). But the Hamitic Hypothesis 
was perhaps most chillingly recalled on the 22nd of November 1992 by Leon 
Mugesera, a prominent Hutu politician, whom, whilst referring to Tutsi in a public 
speech said, Cant you read or hear? Let me tell you that your home is Ethiopia and 
that we shall send you by the river Nyabarongo so that youll get there quickly 
(translated by Eltringham 2003: 22). Mugesera was referring to a recent massacre of 
Tutsi whose bodies had been thrown in the Nyabarongo River a major tributary of 
the Kagera and therefore associated with the Nile. Colonially constructed racial 
understandings of Rwandan history were thus used again as an emotive and 
effective rallying cry during the 1994 Genocide.  
2.4 The Contemporary Context of Research 
The historical perspective presented above is based on a critical reading of the 
available evidence presented by social historians including Mamdani (2001), 
Chrtien (2003) and Eltringham (2004). However, other perspectives exist both inside 
and outside of Rwanda. The main views can be broadly characterised by positions 
held by three separate groups: the Rwandan Government, Hutu opposition and 
western academics. 
The current Rwandan Government promotes a single official narrative that states the 
cause of Rwandan 20th century conflict was colonial ideology and the construction 
and implementation of the Rwandan Hamitic Hypothesis as a ruling principle, 
and that this was compounded by bad governance in post-colonial Rwanda (e.g. 
Shyala 2006). Their authoritative history dismisses any 20th century Tutsi oppression 
of Hutus by placing responsibility for these acts on the colonisers who dictated the 
format of Tutsi leadership. Furthermore, any 19th century oppression is dismissed as 
European misinformation or misunderstanding communicated to foster division 
under colonialism, when in fact pre-colonial Rwanda actually enjoyed social equality 
(Buckley-Zistel 2009: 31). The second position, constituting direct opposition to the 
government, accepts that European influence had a negative impact but emphasises 
Tutsi oppression in pre-colonial and colonial Rwanda as a causal factor (Pottier 2002; 
Longman and Rutagengwa 2004; Straus 2006). This argument suggests that current 
government position, which is also the most widely adopted in the non-Rwandan, 
non-academic sphere, is the result of knowledge construction under the Rwandese 
Patriotic Front (RPF) before, during and after the civil war, created to legitimate a 
new Tutsi dominated government (Pottier 2002: 109-129).  
In contrast to these single narrative explanations there is a compromise view, held 
most commonly by western analysts and academics, that advocates a multi-narrative 
approach which acknowledges many historical causes and that the conflict cannot be 
understood without recognition of political processes in both Rwanda and Europe in 
the 19th and 20th centuries (e.g. Mamdani 2001; Eltringham 2004). (A summary of this 
perspective has been presented above in section 2.3). Despite disagreement over the 
principal causes of the conflict, all positions agree that the racial construction of 
history had a negative influence, is untenable today, and should be deconstructed. 
This section will now discuss in more detail the Rwandan Governments position, 
before outlining how the racial construction of history continues to be problematic in 
contemporary Rwanda in the field of history teaching. The governments view is 
important here because it is the dominant view in Rwanda and it directly affects 
how the pre-colonial past is presented in every facet of Rwandan life, including 
education.  
The Rwandan Governments view regarding the pre-colonial history of Rwanda is 
perhaps best expressed in Shyalas (2006) study The Rwandan Conflict: Origin, 
Development, Exit Strategies commissioned by The National Unity and Reconciliation 
Commission, a powerful government ministry in contemporary Rwanda. Shyala 
(2006: 8-10) suggests that the Rwandan conflict is identity-based and had three 
causal factors:  colonial heritage, chronic bad governance and inadequate and 
conflict generating political systems. Shyala (2006: 10) suggests that colonial heritage 
as a causal factor developed along three main lines:  
The ideological line focused on the Hamitic myth and the theories 
about the populating of Rwanda, the institutional line related to the 
artificiality of the borders of states inherited from colonization and the 
political line based on "divide and rule" practices which have 
characterized colonial policies and which are at the root of the political 
instrumentalization of ethnicity in modern African states, in Rwanda in 
particular. 
Shyala then continues to deconstruct the Hamitic Myth and to present the official 
utopian version of pre-colonial history before tackling the other causal factors 
identified. In each case the failure to manage and eradicate the negative ideologies 
inherited from colonial times is blamed (Shyala 2006: 18). Finally, Shyala (2006: 38) 
concludes that, The Rwandan conflict is neither racial nor ethnic nor caste-based. 
The Hamitic theory and divisionist ideologies which derived from it are its main 
locomotive. Thus, the Rwandan Government has identified racial historical 
presentations of pre-colonial Rwanda as a primary cause of the conflict. However, 
despite promoting engagement with history (see quote below) as a strategy with 
which to promote reconciliation, this only relates to engagement with 20th century 
history and not the pre-colonial past that has been misrepresented (Shyala 2006: 29-
For the National Unity and Reconciliation Commission, the concept of 
Unity and Reconciliation must not focus on the genocide context but on 
all the causes of the Rwandan evil by considering the historical and 
ideological framework. It is in fact the reconstruction process of the 
national identity and reconciliation of the Rwandan with 
himself/herself and with his /her nation. Furthermore, in order to 
reconcile Rwandans, one should reconcile their history (Shyala 2006: 
However, it is not only the 20th century history of conflict that must be engaged with 
and discussed, but also the pre-colonial past according to which so much recent 
division has been justified. In the absence of such debate one ideologically 
constructed authoritative past is simply replaced by another. Whilst it is recognized 
that the latter is no doubt an improvement, because it is designed to foster unity and 
reconciliation instead of division and exclusion, it is also problematic. Authoritative 
single narrative histories, whilst potentially increasing national security by 
restricting debate, have the potential to inadvertently promote resistance and the 
production of equally biased unsubstantiated opposing pasts.  
Whilst the insistence on a single authoritative historical narrative is not supported by 
most non-Rwandan academics, historians generally accept the Governments 
critique of colonial and post-colonial constructions of Rwandas history (Newbury 
1988; Vansina 1998; Des Forges 1999; Newbury and Newbury 2000). However, 
Freedman et al. (2009: 676) have identified three points of contention: Firstly, 
historians do not agree that pre-colonial Rwanda was a nation state with fixed 
borders (e.g. Prunier 1995). Secondly, historians suggest that clan status should not 
be emphasised over and above that of lineage and regional identities (e.g. Newbury 
1980). And finally, there is much disagreement on all sides about the origin and even 
the existence of ethnicity based identity in pre-colonial Rwanda (e.g. Newbury 1988; 
Vansina 2004). (These themes will be returned to in more detail in Chapter 3 section 
3.1 during the discussion of the contribution of social history).  
2.5 History Education in Post-Genocide Rwanda 
The need to engage with the pre-colonial past is most evident in the education 
system. Despite government intentions to promote academic engagement with, and 
deconstruction of, the past, history teaching was suspended in 1995 because the 
syllabus content was racial, divisive, and therefore impossible to teach in the new 
post-genocide climate (Pottier 2002: 127; Buckley-Zistel 2009: 41-42). Efforts were 
made to resolve the issue and in 1997 a new syllabus was created. However, the new 
syllabus was not implemented because it was impotent without new teaching 
resources, including those to train teachers and textbooks (Obura 2003: 99). The 
decision to suspend history teaching was a drastic but necessary emergency 
measure. However, the very idea of suspending history is problematic. It is 
impossible to stop production of history. Education programmes can be shut down, 
but histories will always be constructed with the tools and materials available. 
Unfortunately, in the context of Rwanda this means that people have constructed 
histories in post-genocide Rwanda with racialised and divisive tools and materials 
that were available prior to 1994 (e.g. Overdulve 1997; Sebasoni 2000).  
Under colonialism, the institutional and intellectual racialisation of the Rwandan 
education system was total. Since the establishment of a European style education 
system, one race has benefited disproportionately at the expense of the others. As 
Obura (2003: 98) suggests, the education system was used as an instrument for 
fomenting exclusion and hate. Lessons from history were concretized in the daily life 
of the school itself, first of Bahutu, then of Batutsi, and the continuous exclusion of 
the Batwa The racial past not only dictated the school intake policy but also 
influenced the entire syllabus, After independence distorted historical perceptions 
were included in civic education classes, and were incorporated by the total 
curriculum and the education system itself (Rutembesa 2002: 83, quoted in Obura 
2003: 103). As Mamdani (2001: 89) suggests, the education system in Rwanda was 
the womb of racial ideology. 
It is clear that the education system needs new alternate presentations of the past if 
history is to be successfully reincorporated. This need has long been recognised 
within Rwanda. In 1995 Anastase Gasana, the then Rwandan Home Affairs Minister 
stated that a government priority was to re-write history books (Pottier 2002: 127), 
and Obura (2003: 104) found that outside of government, Seminars, workshops and 
conferences that have addressed the issues over the past eight years; have 
demonstrated remarkable consensus on the need to reconstruct the history of 
Rwanda, and to teach children about unifying historical forces in Rwanda instead of 
divisive ones. Today, there are continuing initiatives to reincorporate history into 
the education system. However, despite investment and co-operative initiatives 
from governmental and non-governmental stakeholders, this aim is yet to be 
successfully achieved.  
Freedman et al (2009: 663-664) have worked on educational issues in Rwanda since 
2001 and following a United States Institute for Peace grant began a collaborative 
research project with Rwandas Ministry of Education, Science, Technology and 
Scientific Research that asked the questions: 
How can material for a history curriculum be developed to avoid 
propaganda? What tensions surface when teachers negotiate an 
increasingly repressive political climate? What opportunities can 
encourage and support democratic teaching and debate about multiple 
perspectives 
As part of this project Freedman et al (2006) and the ministry published The Teaching 
of History: A Participatory Approach, which was a new curriculum for secondary 
schools, meant as a reference book for teachers that encouraged the use of sources, 
discussion and participation. This curriculum was tested in two workshops and five 
teacher education seminars (Freeman et al. 2009: 669). Unfortunately, since then the 
project has come to a halt and the curriculum is yet to be adopted nationally because 
it has lost governmental support due to the reluctance of teachers and other 
stakeholders to discuss pre-colonial identities at a time when the law of divisionism 
appears to outlaw this practice (Buckley-Zistel 2009: 46).   
The participatory approach promoted by Freeman et al (2006, 2009) and initially 
supported by the government represented a positive move away from simply 
writing and teaching the authoritative single narrative History of Rwanda. 
Freedman et al. (2006) separated the curriculum into four chronological modules: 
Pre-Colonial Rwanda (Origin-1897), The Colonisation of Rwanda (1897-1962), Post-
Colonial Rwanda (1962-1990) and Rwanda Post-Colonial (1990-1994). Within the pre-
colonial curriculum the focus was placed on clan history because historically all 
three social groups, Hutu, Tutsi and Twa, were represented in each clan, thus 
promoting the understanding of a shared peaceful past (Freedman et al. 2009: 677). 
Yet, whilst this curriculum was clearly meant to foster reconciliation, and can be 
lauded for its efforts, it fails to discuss anything that happened before the 
establishment of clans and the development of kingdoms in the region, although the 
Renge are briefly mentioned as a precursor to a Rwandan clan. It discusses nothing 
of the achievements or diversity that existed prior to the establishment of the 
kingdoms, nor does it recognise that humans have occupied the territory of modern 
Rwanda for over 10,000 years. Whilst disappointing, Freedman et al.s (2006) limited 
approach is understandable in the present context where reintegration of history 
teaching, suspended now for fifteen years, must be done slowly and sensitively. 
Unfortunately, Freedman et al.s (2006) participatory approach, which promoted the 
creation of multiple narratives based on various individual discursive 
interpretations of the sources, came into conflict with the official authoritative single 
narrative approach favoured by the government. Thus, Freedman et al. (2009: 685) 
conceded, that teaching history cannot be divorced from the states goal of building 
a national or civic identity. The teaching of history therefore remains subject to 
government policies that dictate curricular content and pedagogic practices.  
During a final research trip to Rwanda in March 2009 it was found that the 
government were continuing to work on initiatives that would allow for the speedy 
and smooth reintegration of history teaching into Rwandan secondary schools. This 
included a government committee of politicians, educationalists and heritage 
professionals reviewing old textbooks in order to identify and remove potentially 
offensive or divisive material. This practice is common in post-conflict states, such as 
Bosnia and Herzegovina (Low-Beer 2001). However, the process is reductive because 
it simply removes the problematic areas without enhancing the record with new 
material or interpretations. Furthermore, it is academically problematic because it is 
likely that politically unfavourable elements that do not conform to the official 
narrative will simply be removed whether or not they are evidence based. Yet, in the 
absence of new materials, based on recent research, that are untainted by racial 
constructions and divisionist policies, the Rwandan Government are limited in the 
routes that are available to them.     
2.6 Summary  
This chapter has suggested that the racial construction of Rwandas past was a 
product of late 19th and 20th century politics, and that this construction has 
contributed to 20th century conflicts culminating in the 1994 genocide. This 
construction continues to be problematic and in the absence of any other acceptable 
narratives with which to replace it, combined with the reluctance of the Rwandan 
Government to implement a participatory approach based on extant sources, the re-
introduction of history teaching into secondary schools has been prevented. The 
present research does not support the governments attempt to promote a single 
authoritative narrative. However, it does support a re-investigation of the pre-
colonial past in order to generate new tangible evidence that can further contribute 
towards discussion and debate in Rwanda and to the re-introduction of history 
teaching in the future.  
Chapter 3 
Developing a Theoretical Framework 
The preceding chapter established a contemporary justification for the 
reinvestigation and reconstruction of Rwandas pre-colonial past. The aim of this 
chapter is to develop an appropriate theoretical framework through which to 
investigate that past. This will be achieved by first exploring the contribution that 
social history has made to the deconstruction of colonial and court presentations of 
Rwandas past. Secondly, this chapter will discuss how archaeology has previously 
been applied in Great Lakes Africa and specifically Rwanda. Finally this chapter will 
draw on the themes and concerns identified and will propose a set of research 
objectives, that are both academically and politically based, that will form the 
backbone of a new, more appropriate, archaeological framework though which to 
approach Rwandas pre-colonial past.  
3.1 The Contribution of Social History 
Rwanda has one of the most extensive written historiographies of any African 
society and for much of the 20th century historical studies reproduced and reinforced 
the view that Rwandas past is known, made up of fixed elements and was tied to a 
central Rwandan court (Vansina 2004: 198; Newbury 2009: xxxi). The evidence for 
these accounts was derived from histories preserved as oral traditions that detail life 
during the kingdom era in the late 2nd millennium AD. However, these accounts 
have come under scrutiny more recently due to their uncritical acceptance of the 
evidence (e.g. Chrtien 2003; Vansina 2004; Newbury 1998, 2009). Critical readings 
by social historians have demonstrated that these works are often biased in favour of 
the preferred official narrative of the time and that the oral traditions have 
continually been revised to suit the prevailing political opinion. Furthermore, the 
oral traditions are often narrow in their scope, mostly concerning themselves with 
court and ritual life (Vansina 2004: 4).  
The oral traditions were officially recited and conserved between the 17th and 19th 
centuries by official ideologues employed by the royal court of the Nyiginya 
Kingdom, the progenitor of the nation of Rwanda (Vansina 2004: 4). The histories 
became entrenched in court life, with 300 official historical tales and 175 different 
dynastic poems said to have been amassed by the beginning of the twentieth century 
(Vansina 2004: 221). Before European contact, these traditions were remembered and 
recounted orally, being passed from generation to generation, often learnt by rote, 
but elaborated by each successive generation to support the political actions of the 
court (Vansina 2004: 6). After European contact at the end of the nineteenth century 
(e.g. Ramsay 1898 and Gtzen 1899), Europeans began to write down some of these 
oral traditions (e.g. Loupias 1908) and by 1917 de Briey (1908) had recorded the first 
dynastic succession list (Vansina 2004: 7). In the 1930s, as interest increased, a set of 
collaborators emerged from the royal court that communicated their preferred 
version of Rwandan history to European scholars such as Schumacher (1956) and 
Delmas (1950). However, the most influential histories were recorded by a Rwandan, 
Alexis Kagame (1947, 1951, 1952, 1954, 1959, 1961, 1963, 1969, 1972, 1975, 1981) (also 
see Chapter 2 section 2.3), who by using Schumachers earlier structure and his own 
privileged position as a court ritualist was able to gain access to a wide range of 
officials and was able to write a much richer history than his predecessors. Kagame 
published some of his histories in Kinyarwanda and thus, unlike other scholars, 
found an audience both within Rwanda and the international sphere, helping his 
work to become the official version of history (Vansina 2004: 5). 
Whilst court traditions are of considerable value, they are produced by and for the 
elite of the society, and naturally emphasise events and deeds which promote 
continuity within the centralised structure of the polity (Reid and Lane 2004: 9). 
Thus, official histories based on oral traditions are inherently biased because they 
present only one strand of a complex past. Therefore, where differing versions of the 
same histories from clans, lineages and craft specialists exist these must be collected 
to enable a more nuanced reading of the oral traditions (Reid and Lane 2004: 10). 
Despite the recent adoption of this critical approach (e.g. Chrtien 2003; Vansina 
2004; Newbury 2009), many elements of Kagames model persist in the 
contemporary official narrative (e.g. Freedman et al. 2006).  
Since the late 20th century social historians have questioned fundamental 
components of Rwandas known past through comparative studies of frontier and 
court histories (e.g. Newbury 1987) and through critical reviews of the recorded 
traditions (e.g. Vansina 2004). Their results suggest that 20th century presentations of 
Rwandas pre-colonial past often reflect how the court of Rwanda wished itself to be 
perceived at the end of the 2nd millennium AD and are not an objective history of 
Rwanda. This deconstruction is important for this research because it demonstrates 
how official histories constructed in both pre-colonial and colonial Rwanda have 
stereotyped Rwanda and that localised, subtler approaches can produce a more 
nuanced multi-vocal past.  
The image of Rwandas past promoted by court ideologues was of an ancient 
kingdom, produced by a supernatural creator, which was immediately centralised 
yet autonomous, with linguistic and cultural unity (Vansina 2004: 198-199). This 
construction suggested that a utopian state had been preserved for 100s of years and 
that social inequality and disharmony was only a relatively recent occurrence 
produced by Kigeri Rwabugiris expansionist policies and later by European 
divisionism. In contrast early European explanations suggested that social inequality 
was the product of successive waves of ethno-racial migration. Although they 
continued to characterise Rwandas past as essentially known and static with change 
only occurring in dramatic episodes caused by outside influences (e.g. Hiernaux 
1956; Maquet 1961). However, more recent work by social historians has questioned 
the evidence for these homogenised pasts and has highlighted more complex and 
dynamic internal historical trajectories. For example Vansina (2004: 198) has found 
evidence that linguistic and cultural unity were not present in the early stages of the 
kingdom but were a historical product of expansionism that began in the 18th 
century and continued through until the early 20th century. Furthermore, pre-
colonial Rwanda was not a utopian egalitarian state and ubuhake, client-patron ties, 
have existed since the beginning of the kingdom, subtly changing over time. Vansina 
(2004: 199) suggests that these biases are the direct result of a history seen through 
the eyes of a privileged courtier, Alexis Kagame. This review will now focus on the 
main elements of the social historical deconstruction.   
The official dynastic chronology records an unbroken line of royal succession from 
959 AD to 1959 AD, thus placing the antiquity of Rwanda in the late 1st millennium 
AD. However, Newbury (2009: xxxiv) and Vansina (2004: 198) suggest that the 
succession is extremely unreliable before the 17th century and that the official 
dynastic chronology has been artificially extended by the court ideologues to add to 
the legitimacy of the ruling dynasty. Subsequently, European scholars recorded the 
adapted dynastic list (e.g. Briey 1920) believing it to be accurate because it was 
carefully cross-referenced with lists from neighbouring kingdoms, and similar 
processes took place across the region where Europeans encountered privileged 
royal elites, for example in the kingdoms of Bunyoro and Buganda (see Heinge 
1974). However, Newbury (2009: xxxv) questions the autonomy of these 
chronologies because Rwanda had recently undergone an episode of recent 
aggressive expansionism and may have been able to influence their neighbours 
histories to conform to their own. Furthermore, Rwanda had one of the most 
developed historiographies in the region and it was one of the first to be recorded by 
Europeans. Thus, when inconsistencies in neighbouring dynastic chronologies were 
identified the Rwandan list was used to correct them.  
The clans of Rwanda, throughout the 20th century (e.g. dHertefelt 1971) and in the 
current official narrative (e.g. Freedman et al. 2006) have been presented as fixed, 
permanent, primordial social groups that antedate the kingdom and were the most 
important social categories in pre-colonial Rwanda (Newbury 1980: 389, 2009: xxxi). 
However, Newbury (1980: 389) suggests this presentation has been based on an 
uncritical reading of the Rwandan past. Through his analysis of Marcel dHertefelts 
(1971) Les Clans du Rwanda Ancien Newbury (1980) has identified numerous 
inconsistencies within clan concepts. For example, the belief that all clans began as 
solely Tutsi or Hutu groups and were sustained through patrilineal succession (e.g. 
Kagame 1954: 105) yet came to contain stable percentages of Hutu, Tutsi and Twa 
individuals (Newbury 1980: 390-391). Instead Newbury suggests that clans and clan 
concepts were not stable but were historical constructs that changed both with the 
development of new internal dynamics and through varying alliances. Clans were 
subject to political forces and whilst clans could be destroyed or amalgamated with 
other clans, new clans could also be formed (Newbury 2009: xxxii; Vansina 2004: 
198). For example, different components within clans could sometimes evolve into 
sub-clans (Chrtien 2003: 92), and furthermore, both Newbury (1980, 2009) and 
Vansina (2004) suggest lineage and kin groupings were more important identities 
than clan groups in pre-colonial Rwanda and thus clans should not be over-
emphasised.  
The official pre-colonial and Colonial histories presented kingship in Rwanda as an 
all powerful, well-defined, autonomous and divine role (e.g. Kagame 1947, 1951). 
However, Newbury (2009: xxxiii) suggests that kingship in pre-colonial Rwanda was 
not a rigid concept and was actually explicitly manipulated as the court sought to 
manoeuvre greater advantages and the kings of Rwanda were neither autocratic 
nor omnipotent (Vansina 2004: 5, 198). For example, the king was not the only 
important actor in society, the queen mother was also an independent authority in 
her own right, and the power and influence of court ritualists and counsellors 
should not be ignored (Vansina 2004: 66). Furthermore, the concept of divine 
kingship did not appear until the arrival of Europeans influenced by the work of 
Frazer (1890) (e.g. Roscoe 1911). However, this model failed to appreciate that 
Rwandan kingship was built on a popular power base and that the position involved 
the creation, and careful implementation, of political strategies and manoeuvrings to 
balance both the ambitions of the king and the needs of society (Newbury 2009: 
xxxiv). Thus, the imposition of divine kingship distanced the king from his subjects 
and the popular legitimacy of the king was eroded and this aided the dissolution of 
the monarchy in 1959.  
The current official narrative suggests that social hierarchy in Rwanda is a relatively 
recent development and that until the late 19th century Rwanda was largely 
egalitarian (Freedman et al. 2006). However, critical comparisons of both frontier 
and court oral traditions have identified a slow process of social disaggregation 
developing from at least the 18th century (Newbury 1987, 2009: xxxii). Whilst 
processes were accelerated under Rwabugiri it was a continuous process that had 
begun in earlier periods (Vanisna 2004: 165). However, for the purposes of 
reconciliation the Rwandan government have preferred to promote Alexis Kagames 
(1954, 1975) utopian view of the past. Whilst their motivation is laudable, it 
continues to re-produce a naturalised, static, fixed and known past, and ignores the 
potential for dynamic historical processes at work in pre-colonial Rwanda.   
For much of the 20th century and in some recent historical narratives, social identity 
in Rwanda was believed to be the result of three successive migrations of Twa 
foragers, Hutu farmers and Tutsi pastoralists (e.g. Hiernaux 1956; Maquet 1961; 
Overdulve 1997; Sebasoni 2000). However, there is a growing consensus among 
social historians that these identities were slowly developed within the country and 
therefore cannot relate to migrations, although gradual migrations may have taken 
place (Vansina 2004: 198). The ethno-racial migration model is the most prominent of 
all the Rwandan historical stereotypes. It has been blamed for divisionism and 
conflict in the 20th century and thus has received the most attention during the 
deconstruction and will thus receive the most attention here.  
Vansina (2004: 35-36) has identified two main types of identity in pre-colonial 
Rwanda, territorial and non-territorial identity. There are two territorial identities 
Renge and Rwanda and three non-territorial identities Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa. Renge 
means mountain people and referred to a single group of people on the northern 
borders of the country whilst Rwanda refers to a large variety of groups and was 
used with a geographic qualifier to refer to a particular group identity, such as 
Rwanda Budaha, literally meaning the people of Budaha. The non-territorial 
identities, Tutsi, Hutu and Twa, have a more complicated history. Twa refers to a 
group of short pygmy hunter-gatherers commonly associated with forest or marsh 
living and pottery production in western Great Lakes Africa (Vansina 2004: 36). 
Whilst they had limited options of inter-marriage with other social groups, and had 
hostile relations with farmers because of tensions over access to land, they also 
enjoyed interactions through trade for forest and agricultural products (Vansina 
2004: 36). The lack of opportunities for inter-marriage due to their demographic, 
geographic and social marginalisation has meant that concepts of Twa identity have 
remained relatively stable and conservative. However, the Twa did not live in social 
isolation, for example, Twa were present in all of the Rwandan clans and oral 
histories record an instance where a Twa was able to enter into patron-client based 
pastoral relations and obtain cattle (Kagame 1961: 27-28). Furthermore, from the late 
19th century, during the reigns of Rwabugiri and Musinga, a Twa section of the royal 
army was introduced as a personal guard to the king (Schumacher 1958: 424-425, 
621). The Twa also had a permanent presence at the royal court and played 
important roles in the founding traditions of the Rwandan dynasty (Vansina 2004: 
69, 189, 193). However, to this day Twa have remained a peripheral minority and 
whilst they are no longer able to practise hunting in modern Rwanda they are still 
known as potters. In contrast, concepts of Hutu and Tutsi identity have been subject 
to long processes of political evolution.  
The term Tutsi has the longest history and Hutu only appeared later as an 
expression of otherness in relation to Tutsi, when social and political 
transformations required such a definition (Eltringham 2004: 13; Newbury 1978: 
17). Before the establishment of the kingdom there were a variety of possible 
meanings for Tutsi. For example it may have referred to all herders, one category of 
herders from the south or just a political elite amongst herders. Although the 
evidence is inconclusive, Vansina (2004: 37) suggests that Tutsi was originally a self-
referential term for a social class amongst herders, a political elite similar to those 
found in Burundi and Karagwe. In contrast when the term Hutu first appeared in 
the 17th century it was not self-referential but was derogatory, a term used by elites 
to refer to rural louts (Vansina 2004: 134). The word could be used for anybody, 
including Tutsi, Twa and all foreigners, which one wished to refer negatively to. 
However, these identities were not stable and these concepts were continuously 
evolving in response to internal political developments.  
The meanings of Hutu and Tutsi have received a lot of attention in both the popular 
media and in academia and the debate can be characterised by two opposing 
positions: distinct difference versus no-distinct difference (Mamdani 2001: 44-
46). The distinct difference argument rests upon four main points phenotype, 
genotype, memory and archaeology and suggests that differences in height and blood 
types conclusively point to significantly different geographic origins for Hutu and 
Tutsi, who thus must have come into contact through large scale population 
movement and that oral histories and archaeological remains support. The polemic 
no distinct-difference argument (Mamdani 2001: 48-49) refuted these claims 
suggesting that differences in height and blood types were created through social 
selection and that the oral histories and archaeological explanations were biased 
because they were recorded or produced in a racial climate when migration was a 
dominant explanatory paradigm. Whilst the no-distinct difference proponents do 
not deny that migration may have existed they question its relevance based on four 
arguments.  
The first argument highlights the distinction between migration and conquest. For 
example, Vansina (2004: 198) suggests that any migration would have been a slow 
process of acculturation and infiltration that took place over centuries and would not 
have fitted a conquest model. The second questioned the presumed link between 
Tutsi migration and the arrival of pastoralism and statecraft in the region. 
Archaeological (Reid 1994/5, 1996, 2001; Robertshaw 1994, 1999; Gautier 1983; Van 
Grunderbeek et al. 1983), linguistic (Schoenbrun 1998) and historical research 
(Vansina 2004) have demonstrated that pastoralism and cattle keeping has been 
practiced in Rwanda and the surrounding region for over one thousand years and 
archaeological examples of early polities have been identified that trace the slow 
process of centralization, and the indigenous development of statehood, in the 
region.  The third argument questioned the association of cultural change with the 
movement of peoples. Historians (Lwanga-Lunyigo and Vansina 1998; Vansina 
2004) and archaeologists (Reid 1994/5, 1996, 2001; Robertshaw 1994, 1999) suggest 
that socio-political and economic changes that occurred in the region are better 
understood as internally driven processes and they have questioned the western 
assumption that all change in Africa must be externally driven. The fourth argument 
questions the presumption that modern Hutu and Tutsi were the pure offspring of 
separate Hutu and Tutsi ancestors. For example, these social identities shared 
economies, armies, language and kin groups, and inter-marriage was frequent 
(Mamdani 2001: 50-54). Whilst divisions were to grow between Hutu and Tutsi, 
largely due to the imposition of uberetwa, a daily form of servitude enforced upon 
the land holding Hutu by the ruling Tutsi dynasty (Vansina 2004: 135), under King 
Rwabugiri (see Chapter 2 section 2.2), it is clear that through intermarriage and 
interbreeding, and social fluidity, Hutu and Tutsi are not the pure descendants of 
original Hutu and Tutsi generations.  
Following his review, Mamdani (2001: 57) suggests a more reasoned approach to the 
identity and origin debate because both arguments are untenable. For example, the 
no distinct difference argument ignores the significance of new arrivals whilst the 
distinct difference argument fails to recognise the potential for slow migration and 
subsequent physical and cultural mixing. As an alternative Mamdani suggests a 
weakened model that incorporates both arguments where migration is a slow, 
gradual potentially peaceful, infiltration, taking place over at least hundreds if not 
thousands of years, alongside social selection controlled by factors such as 
intermarriage and differing diets. Both Mamdani (2001: 56) and Vansina (2004: 36, 
198) suggest that Hutu and Tutsi are not racial, economic, socio-biological or cultural 
identities but are better understood as ever changing and evolving political 
identities. Hutu and Tutsi have centuries of shared history and it is apparent that 
during their history meanings have changed both diachronically and synchronically 
and thus, they are polyvalent identities (Eltringham 2004: 13).  
This review has described how core themes in the official presentations of Rwandas 
past were produced by uncritical readings of court traditions and how this has 
resulted in a historical narrative formed of fixed boundaries that confirm state 
legitimacy and central policy. In response to this construction Newbury (2009: xxxii) 
suggests that future research must focus on frontiers, personal experience, multiple 
agency at local scales. Only through comparison of the histories of peoples outside of 
the court with those within it can a more objective and multi-faceted past be 
developed. Thus, studies must be empirically based, locally themed and broadly 
inclusive (Newbury 2009: xxxi). However, whilst these themes can be compared to 
similar post-processual objectives within archaeology, these have yet to be applied to 
Rwandan archaeology.   
Recent social historical research has begun the slow task of generating alternatives to 
the official single-narrative by championing a multi-vocal historically and locally, 
contextualised past. However, as a result of their critical re-analysis of the dynastic 
chronology, an ancient dynastic history spanning over 1000 years has been 
drastically reduced.  
Moreover, many elements of the deconstruction are readily ignored in contemporary 
Rwanda because they are believed to be politically unfavourable. The government 
currently favours a single narrative, non-negotiable, utopian, socially egalitarian past 
(Buckley-Zistel 2009: 31) and are thus more inclined to favour Kagames histories 
(e.g. Freedman et al. 2006; Shyala 2006). Furthermore, in the absence of empirical and 
tangible data the social historical critique may be devalued and viewed by relativists 
as yet another interpretation of the same old biased sources. Therefore, a need exists 
for new research methods to be applied to the Rwandan pre-colonial past that can 
explore greater time depths than those covered by oral traditions and that can 
produce tangible, scientific, empirical data. Archaeology is well placed to respond to 
this need and has the potential to explore new histories that can contribute towards a 
more nuanced and subtle understanding of pre-colonial Rwanda as part of a multi-
narrative approach. However, archaeology is not new to Rwanda or Great Lakes 
Africa, and like history, has not been immune to ethno-racial dogmas.  
3.2 Archaeological Theory and Great Lakes Africa 
Europeans brought archaeology to Rwanda at the beginning of the 20th century and 
enthusiastic amateurs who had an interest in the Palaeolithic undertook the first 
archaeological investigations (de Maret 1990: 110; Robertshaw 1990). At first there 
was little regard for later periods, which were not deemed relevant to the European 
practitioners of Colonial Archaeology, who were concerned with early man and 
not the history of Africans (Trigger 1984: 362). Boutakoffs (1937) cave excavations, 
which revealed a complete archaeological sequence from the Stone Age to the Iron 
Age, were a rare exception. It was not until the 1950s that the first professional 
programmes were initiated, such as the Institute Recherche Scientifique en Afrique 
Centrale (IRSAC) (Vansina 1994), and archaeology expanded intermittently in a 
variety of directions to include more recent time periods (see Hiernaux 1954, 1968; 
Hiernaux and Maquet 1957, 1960; Nenquin 1967a; Van Noten 1983; Van 
Grunderbeek et al. 1983). Unfortunately, growing political tensions in the 1980s led 
to the cessation of all archaeological research, and despite sustained stability since 
1994, archaeological fieldwork did not resume. This failure is partly due to a lack of 
funds to ignite an indigenous training programme but also, it is believed, because 
foreign archaeologists have felt logistically or emotionally unable to engage with 
post-conflict, post-genocide Rwanda. Thus, the past in Rwanda is yet to benefit from 
the themes and techniques developed over the past three decades and therefore the 
extant archaeological explanations are largely confined to a period in which 
normative culture historical models and ethno-linguistic agendas were the norm in 
African Archaeology.  
Culture-History was the dominant theoretical model in Europe when archaeologists 
began working in Great Lakes Africa. V. Gordon Childe was the first to 
systematically apply the concept of archaeological cultures, in his The Dawn of 
European Civilization (1925), and it quickly became the working tool of all European 
archaeologists (Trigger 1989: 169). Childean culture-history divided prehistory into 
cultural units with empirically established chronological and geographic boundaries 
to create a complex framework of European cultures (Sheratt 1989: 176). Childe 
developed his theoretical approach in The Danube in Prehistory (1929) where he set 
out a polythetic culture-historicism that identified cultures based on a number of 
unifying traits. Within Childes model some materials were given different cultural 
values. For example, ceramics were high value because these were believed to be 
resistant to change and thus a good indicator of cultural unity, whilst tools and 
weapons were believed to be less resistant to change. Where tools and weapons 
crossed ceramic boundaries they were thought to be evidence of contact and 
diffusion (Trigger 1989: 171). Childe was not only interested in describing material 
traits but also internal structures, such as economy, social and political organisation 
and religious beliefs.  
In Rwandan archaeology culture-history can be seen in the work of Hiernaux and 
Maquet (1957, 1960) Nenquin (1967a) and Van Noten (1983) who identified discrete 
archaeological cultures based on the association of similar ceramics, furnaces and 
distribution patterns. The culture-historical model was widely adopted in Great 
Lakes Africa because it allowed archaeologists to begin the long job of structuring 
and describing the past in a previously unexplored area of the world. Culture-
history was also beneficial for Nationalist Archaeologies that bolstered national 
pride in the run up to, and during, independence from colonial rule (Trigger 1984: 
360). However, in Europe in the late 1950s and 1960s culture-history received 
increasingly strong criticism because it failed to develop new explanations for 
culture change and continued to support evolutionary approaches that suggested 
change was the product of migration or diffusion. Thus culture-history continued to 
promote the belief that cultures were essentially passive, resistant, internally 
homogenous, and were only liable to change through external stimuli. 
Processual Archaeology developed in the 1950s and 1960s in America and Europe in 
response to the narrow empiricism of culture-history. The development of New 
Archaeology and its interest in ecology, settlement patterns and cultural processes 
influenced the development of processual archaeology (e.g. Caldwell 1959; Binford 
1962, 1965). In Britain processual archaeology was influenced by locational analysis 
and general systems theory (e.g. Clarke 1968). In contrast to normative culture-
history, Processualism is founded on the belief that archaeology should ask 
questions about human societies, test hypothesis, and not simply describe culture 
history (Earl and Preucel 1987: 501). For processual archaeologists this was possible 
because human behaviour was believed to be essentially predictable in the way it 
adapts to external pressures. To archaeologists such as Clarke (1973) this reflected 
archaeologys loss of innocence as it developed into a mature discipline based on 
rigorous scientific testing. Unlike culture-history, New Archaeology suggested that 
cultures were not internally homogenous because they were at least differentiated by 
age and gender roles (Trigger 1989: 296). Instead of resorting to diffusion or 
migration as explanations of cultural change (e.g. Childe 1925, 1929), it emphasised 
cultural development from an internal point of view, allowing for the capacity of 
humans to invent new social structures and technologies by adapting to evolving 
social systems. In direct opposition to the historical particularism of culture-history, 
the results of processualism were the identification of interconnecting webs of 
cultural processes and the development of anthropological meta-theories based on 
large-scale cultural patterns (Earl and Preucel 1987: 504). However, despite its 
emphasis on internal processes, cultural change remained essentially the result of 
external stimuli, such as environmental pressures. Thus, processual archaeology, like 
culture history, lacked human agency, and cultures continue to be presented as 
essentially passive (Trigger 1989: 296-297).  
Archaeologists working in Great Lakes Africa were slow to adopt processualism as 
elsewhere on the continent, there are no instances of processual archaeology in 
Rwanda and examples in the wider region are rare. Archaeologists in Great Lakes 
Africa were more concerned with filling geographical and chronological gaps, 
through the identification of past peoples, than grand theorizing, often believing 
African Archaeology to be theory-free. The growing body of linguistic data 
supported the continuation of culture-history by generating new groups of named 
people for archaeological distribution patterns to be attributed to. Thus, the culture 
remained the main archaeological analytical unit in Great Lakes Africa. 
In the 1980s Post-Processualism developed in response to processualisms 
assumption of scientific objectivity and its failure to address human agency. Whilst it 
continued to value objectivity, post-processualism suggested that archaeology was 
inherently biased and that it must be explicit about this. For example, Shanks and 
Tilley (1987: 104) suggested that a fourfold hermeneutic existed, in which four stages 
of interpretative bias separate the archaeologist from the alien cultures of the past. 
This hyper-relativist view described the complex and dynamic interplay between the 
analytical unit and the analyser. Whilst the extreme view of Shanks and Tilley has 
not been universally accepted, post-processualists generally agree that 
archaeologists, work back and forth between theory and data, building, testing and 
tearing down models in order to construct improved ones that better fit what are 
perceived to be the facts (David and Kramer 2001: 57). An early proponent of post-
processual thought was Ian Hodder who demonstrated that archaeological 
patterning could be the result of multiple factors and rejected the objective, 
scientific-testablility of archaeology (e.g. Hodder and Orton 1976). Hodder (1982) 
conducted some of the first ethno-archaeological work in Africa and demonstrated 
that material culture was actively manipulated and was meaningfully constituted as 
part of different social strategies and was capable of communicating multiple 
meanings. Post-processualism highlighted the importance of beliefs and values in 
the past shifting the focus away from generalizing theories back to historical 
particularism. Critics of post-processualism have highlighted its relativism, its 
failure to address large-scale archaeological patterns and its return to the 
particularism of culture-history (e.g. Khol 1993: 13-26). However, unlike culture 
history post-processualism moved beyond simplistic one to one relationships and 
has developed multi-vocality through the exploration of sub-sets within cultures 
such as gender enhancing our understanding of heterogeneity in the past (Emberling 
1997: 295). 
Archaeology in Great Lakes Africa has borrowed themes from post-processualism, 
such as gender archaeology (e.g. Kent 1998; Maclean 1998) and ethnoarchaeological 
research (e.g. Hodder 1982; Reid and Maclean 1995; MacEachern 2006). However, 
culture history remains the dominant theoretical approach. This is because there are 
still many geographical and chronological gaps that can benefit from the descriptive 
potential of culture history and because archaeologists working in Great Lakes 
Africa have been reluctant to apply alternate models. However, there is now a 
growing dissatisfaction with the normative culture-historical approach (e.g. Stewart 
1993: 29; Ashley 2005). For example, ethnoarchaeology has demonstrated that the 
one to one association of ceramic patterns and peoples should not be assumed (e.g. 
Herbich 1987: 195-199) and archaeologists have begun to explore local-scale 
dynamics that have multi-factor explanations (e.g. Reid 1991, 1996; Robertshaw 1994, 
1997; Ashley 2005; Posnansky et al. 2007; Lane et al. 2007). However, Rwandan 
archaeology is yet to benefit from these more textured approaches. Due to political 
instability and the resulting cessation of archaeological research at the beginning of 
the 1980s, post-processual approaches have yet to be applied. This is unfortunate 
because archaeology in Rwanda continues to be associated with outmoded racial 
thinking and ethno-racial models implicit in previous normative-culture historical 
approaches in Great Lakes Africa.  
3.3 Archaeology and Racial Thinking in Great Lakes Africa and Rwanda 
Racial thinking and archaeology have had a long relationship in Europe and Africa. 
In the late 19th century the evolutionary approach to the study of cultures promoted 
a strong relationship between prehistoric archaeology and ethnology (Trigger 1989: 
110). In this unilinear model, cultures were arranged in evolutionary stages, from 
simplest to most complex (e.g. Spencer 1885), examples of which could be seen 
preserved in fossilised contemporary ethnographic groups. The early evolutionary 
approach during the Enlightenment believed in the essential equality of all human 
cultures and their inherent potential. However, in the late 19th century a growing 
sense of nationalism led academics to treat cultural characteristics as almost 
unchangeable biological differences. For example, Spencer (1885) believed that 
whilst native peoples may strive towards cultural progress the process was likely to 
be so slow as to be imperceptible to the contemporary observer (Johnson 1999: 134). 
Thus, the simplest cultures were doomed to racial inferiority.  
This approach gained scientific support from Darwinian evolutionism (Trigger 1989: 
113). Darwins views were quite distinct from those of Spencer, for example 
Darwinian evolution in archaeology investigated the development of certain cultural 
phenomena not cultures as a whole as had been the case previously (OBrien and 
Lyman 2006: 2). Nevertheless, Darwinian ideas were harnessed by others to support 
wholesale cultural evolution. For example, Lubbock (1865, 1870) explicitly 
incorporated Darwinian evolutionism into prehistoric archaeology and promoted a 
unilinear cultural evolution where extinct less evolved races were doomed to be 
wiped out by the spread of civilisation.   
Although culture-history rejected unilinear cultural evolution and eternal 
biologically defined cultural differences, it did not escape racial thinking completely. 
For example, culture-history continued to suggest that archaeological cultures 
reflected ethnicity (e.g. Kossina 1911) and to draw analogies between archaeological 
and ethnographic cultures. Childean culture-history associated archaeological 
remains with specific, or nameless, peoples that were given value based on their 
cultural or natural superiority (e.g. Childe 1925, 1929). Whilst hard racial 
modelling went out of fashion in Europe after the Nazi atrocities of the 2nd World 
War, soft racism persisted (Hall 1996: 128). Soft racism in culture-history existed 
within the presumed relationship between archaeological cultures, ethnicity and 
mechanisms for culture-change. Explanations of culture change based on migration 
or diffusion suggested that change only occurred by contact with outside culturally 
superior stimuli, which retains implicit links with the epistemology of racism. Whilst 
these explanations of culture change were largely replaced in Europe in the 1950s 
and 60s by processual models the same cannot be said in Great Lakes Africa where 
culture-historicism has persisted until today. For example, from the early 20th 
century the Hamitic Hypothesis (discussed in Chapter 2 section 2.3) remained a 
dominant explanatory model in African archaeology, where race not only described 
biology but also culture, including political organisation and subsistence activities 
(MacGaffey 1966). 
Although some archaeologists working in Great Lakes Africa explicitly rejected the 
Hamitic Hypothesis (e.g. Sutton 1986) others continued to support it. Within 
Rwanda the racial premise can most clearly be seen in the work of Jean Hiernaux, a 
medical doctor and anthropologist from Belgium, who worked closely with Emma 
Maquet to produce some of the first archaeological publications concerning Rwanda 
Burundi and the Congo (e.g. Hiernaux 1954, 1962, 1968; Hiernaux and Maquet 1957, 
1960) (de Maret 1990: 128). Hiernaux (1956) was interested in the physical traits of 
modern peoples, he conducted anthropometric studies in Rwanda and used racial 
terms to distinguish between Hamitic Tutsi, Bantu Hutu and pygmoid Twa, 
characterising them based on their height and other body proportions. Hiernaux also 
attempted to assign blood group distribution using anthropology. However, he was 
to later soften his views: 
The Tutsi of Rwanda and of Burundi have dark skin, frizzy hair and 
small noses; they combine characteristics that for an old typological 
approach to anthropology would be considered both white and black. 
However, they have nothing to do with a mixture of whites and black. It 
is their biological history that makes them what they are.. it is a 
question of selection. Classificatory mania, which is peculiar to the 
human spirit and maybe especially so to European culture in recent 
centuries, for years obsessed anthropologists, who are only now 
beginning to extricate themselves from it. (Hiernaux 1968 quoted in 
Chrtien 2003: 76).   
Despite Hiernauxs shift away from describing Tutsi as Caucasoid Hamitic he 
continued to define them biologically in opposition to Hutu and Twa, and to 
uncritically associate these biological characteristics with archaeological finds (e.g. 
Hiernaux 1956, 1968, 1974). For example, where short skeletons were found during 
archaeological excavations in association with roulette-decorated pottery, a ceramic 
he believed to be associated with agriculture, these were attributed to Hutu (e.g. 
Hiernaux and Maquet 1957, 1960; Hiernaux 1956). Even when archaeological 
skeletons were excavated without associated archaeological remains these were 
attributed to Tutsi, Hutu or Twa, based on height. Hiernaux also engaged in 
extensive discussions about the Renge, a pre-kingdom era people mentioned in the 
oral traditions of Rwanda believed to predate the kingdom of Rwanda, who 
Hiernaux compared to the Hutu because of their short, stocky stature and supposed 
relationship with agriculture (despite contradictions in the oral traditions that he 
recorded himself that suggested the Hutu and Renge are not related, Hiernaux 1974). 
Whilst archaeologists outside of Rwanda, such as Posnansky (1966), refuted 
Hiernauxs claims with direct archaeological evidence, Hiernauxs views have 
persisted within archaeological interpretations concerning Rwandan society and 
identity until very recently.  
In 1967 Nenquin published the first synthesis of Rwandan and Burundian 
archaeology, Contributions to the Study of the Prehistoric Cultures of Rwanda and 
Burundi. Whilst Nenquin avoided attributing a specific ethnic identity to the 
producers of the Early Iron Age dimple-based ceramics he describes, he associates 
B-Ware ceramics, a roulette-decorated ceramic with the Renge (Nenquin 1967a: 
272). Nenquin (1967a: 281, 276) also discusses the association of iron working 
remains with Renge and repeats the assertion that skulls found in the Musanze 
Caves (a group of volcanic caves in northern Rwanda, discussed in more detail in 
Chapters 4, 8 and 9) can be attributed to Hutu based on cranial measurements taken 
by Brabant (1963). Finally, Nenquin (1967a: 287) attributes B-Ware to probable 
Hutu skeletal material found at Ruli.  
Racial thinking has permeated most Rwandan archaeologies. For Van Noten (1983) 
who published a synthesis of Rwandan Archaeology, Histoire Archaeologique du 
Rwanda, begins his book by explaining that the social constitution of Rwanda is 
made up of three racially and economically defined ethnicities:  
Aujourdhui nous constatons que la region interlacustrine est peuple 
de trios ethnies. Des noirs Hutus, parlant une langue bantoe et pour cela 
appels Bantous; ils reprsentent la grande majorit et vivent 
traditionnellement de lagriculture. Un deuxime groupe, Tutsi, est 
dorigine ethiopide; ce sont des pasteurs. Le troisime groupe est 
constitut de Pygmes, appels Twa au Rwanda; ils sont aujourdhui 
potiers, mais taient chasseurs  lorigine. (Van Noten 1983: 10)  
Van Noten continues to use the Hamitic model to explain social organisation and 
identity in Great Lakes Africa but disassociates himself from direct analogies of 
particular ceramics with particular identity groups such as the Bantu or Tutsi:  
Archologiquement il ny a pas moyen de parler dune cramique 
bantoue ou tutsi; il faut en dautres mots dissocier ces elements 
physiques, archologiques, historiques et linguistiques. (Van Noten 
1983: 63) 
And despite earlier beliefs to the contrary, Van Noten concludes that the one to one 
association of archaeological ages with the appearance of social identities in Rwanda 
is untenable:  
Nous avons nous-mmes t tents dassocier lge pierre recent aux 
Twa, lge du fer ancien aux Hutu et lge du fer recent  larrive des 
Tutsi, mais il nous semble aujourdhui que cette vocation est simpliste 
et improuvable. (Van Noten 1983: 63) 
Although Van Noten rejected direct correlation, other archaeologists working in 
Rwanda and Great Lakes Africa have continued to promote them. For example, in 
Desmedts (1991) regional ethno-linguistic model of roulette-decoration distribution 
she repeatedly refers to the pottery of the Renge and even titles one of her section 
headings LAge du fer recent au Rwanda: les Renge. She also engages with an extensive 
discussion of the possible geographic origins of the Tutsi relating them to the arrival 
of pastoralism in Rwanda and her W-Group pottery in the 8th century AD 
(Desmedt 1991: 184). There are however, exceptions to these models, most notably in 
the work of Van Grunderbeek who has explored a range of Iron Age issues in 
Rwanda and Burundi, most prominently archaeometallurgy (e.g. Van Grunderbeek 
1981, 1988, 1992; Van Gunderbeek et al. 1983, 2001; Van Grunderbeek and Roche 
2005). Van Grunderbeek has avoided making ethno-racial assumptions about 
Rwandan society or archaeology and has questioned the association of 
archaeological pastoralism with Tutsi (Van Grunderbeek et al. 1983: 52 see also Van 
Grunderbeek 1981: 27) by identifying anomalies between the archaeological 
evidence and oral traditions, such as the appearance of archaeological pastoral 
remains in the Early Iron Age in southern Rwanda almost 1000 years before the 
supposed arrival of the Tutsi (Van Grunderbeek 1981: 27).  
Whilst racial thinking has clearly influenced archaeological interpretations in 20th 
century Rwanda it is important to recognise that the influence of these 
archaeological models has not been confined to academic discourse. Racial thinking, 
which promoted definable, bounded entities and divided peoples, based on 
physical, cultural and economic differences, helped verify a racial view of ethnicity 
in 20th century Africa and contributed towards ethnic tensions. It is probable that if 
archaeological research in Rwanda had not ceased in the late 1970s and early 1980s, 
then the ethno-racial models that characterised early research would have been 
widely refuted by new research like they have in neighbouring countries. However, 
in the absence of any new research within Rwanda, Van Grunderbeeks important 
reviews remain the exception and not the rule. During archaeologys absence in 
Rwanda, and before its disappearance, archaeologists working in other Great Lakes 
Africa countries have turned to ethno-linguistic models to aid the investigation of 
Iron Age identities. 
3.4 Archaeology and Linguistics in Great Lakes Africa 
Many archaeologists working in Great Lakes Africa have looked to historical 
linguistics to help inform the archaeological record. However, the uncritical usage of 
these sources has led to the continuation of ethno-racial models associated with 
normative culture-history. For example, Hiernaux (1968) characterised the Bantu 
language group culturally (e.g. agriculturalists, iron workers and dimple-based 
potters). He also suggested that there was physical kinship amongst Bantu speakers 
from Cameroon to Tanzania and that any observed variations were adaptations to 
forest conditions or the result of mixing. 
Historical linguistic studies in Great Lakes Africa initially focussed on the 
appearance of the Bantu language group at the beginning of the Early Iron Age and 
its subsequent branching into descendant groups in the Late Iron Age (e.g. Oliver 
1966). Due to the meagreness of the archaeological record archaeology looked to 
historical linguistic studies as a means to identify and investigate social identity (e.g. 
Ambrose 1982; Desmedt 1991; Ehret 1998; Schoenbrun 1998). Although less 
fashionable today, ethno-linguistic models still arise (McMaster 2005). These models 
describe how by migration or diffusion different languages have spread across the 
region and associate these with the appearance and spread of certain archaeological 
materials such as ceramics (specific examples of which are discussed in Chapter 4.6). 
Thus, the uncritical use of linguistic models has seen the continuation of ethno-racial 
culture change models associated with culture-historicism. However, the 
relationship between archaeology and linguistics is not simple and should not be 
seen as a one to relationship. Despite this, both have tended to uncritically accept the 
models of the other and to over generalise (Nurse 1997: 379) and there is still 
dissatisfaction with how archaeology and linguistics interact (Eggert 2005).  
Today linguistics have moved beyond migration models and their ethno-racial 
connotations (Vansina 2004: 173-175), and towards a firm sociological approach 
looking within societal groupings rather than merely investigating the chronological 
and spatial relationships between them (e.g. Schoenbrun 1998; Ehret 1998; Vansina 
2004). There have also been limited efforts to incorporate these in Great Lakes Africa 
archaeologies (e.g. Reid and Schoenbrun 1994; Robertshaw 1999). However, 
examples are rare and archaeologists continue to return to simplistic linguistic 
models that have since been rejected by linguists themselves (e.g. Phillipson 2005). 
Nevertheless, historical linguistic studies still have much to offer archaeologists 
working in Great Lakes Africa and Rwanda. For example, Schoenbrun (1998: 78) has 
demonstrated that there is a sudden explosion of cattle terminologies in Great Lakes 
Africa c.900AD, suggesting a rapidly growing reliance on herding strategies for 
subsistence. Furthermore, he has used the linguistic evidence to suggest that these 
do not simply relate to the arrival of a new population because all the terms for 
horns, skin colour and pattern are Bantu in origin, a language already established in 
the region for over 1000 years. Thus, in contrast to Desmedt (1991), a critical 
approach to the data generated by historical linguistic studies can help deconstruct 
normative ethno-racial migration explanations of culture change, which has great 
potential in a Rwandan context. Therefore, this research will look to social historical 
linguistic studies such as Shoenbruns (1998) work as a comparative resource and the 
historical-linguistic evidence for Great Lakes Africa and Rwanda will be discussed in 
detail in Chapter 4.  
3.5 Ethnicity and Rwanda 
Considering the recent historical and contemporary context of research in Rwanda 
(see Chapter 2 sections 2.3-4), and the relationship between archaeology and 
ethnicity, it is important to ask how archaeologists can approach the issue of 
ethnicity in Rwanda when it is such a loaded concept. The above discussions have 
highlighted how ethno-racial identity-based models have affected the interpretation 
of the pre-colonial past in Great Lakes Africa and Rwanda specifically. Furthermore, 
archaeological narratives continue to be associated with divisionism in Rwanda, and 
in the wider region culture-historical approaches have continued to focus on the 
identification of ethnicity in archaeology (e.g. de Maret 2005). This is problematic 
because it continues to support ethno-racial explanations in the region and in 
Rwanda and because it hinders the successful incorporation of archaeological 
narratives into education and other public spheres. However, this chapter has 
already discussed the complex evolution of the terms Hutu and Tutsi and the mixed 
society that they were a part of. Thus, it may be inappropriate to even attempt to 
identify Hutu, Tutsi or Twa archaeologies because it is almost impossible to 
distinguish between their material culture remains and to make a confident 
attribution. Therefore, the following section will discuss contemporary 
anthropological understandings of ethnicity and will argue that ethnicity, as it is 
understood today is not an accessible identity within the pre-colonial archaeology of 
Rwanda because that period contained a variety of socially ambiguous groups that 
cannot be separated based on material culture remains alone.  
The word ethnicity is derived from the Greek word ethnos meaning nation or 
people. Banks (1996) has traced the earliest usage of the word in its current context 
to 1942 when Warner and Lunt used it to describe social and biological group status. 
The word appeared again as a socio-biological term in UNESCOs 1950 The Race 
Question, when a series of prominent scholars including Ashley Montagu, Claude 
Lvi-Strauss, Gunnar Myrdal and Julian Huxley suggested relinquishing the term 
race entirely and replacing it with ethnicity because people were misusing the 
term race (Metraux 1950).  
National, religious, geographic, linguistic and cultural groups do not 
necessarily coincide with racial groups; and the cultural traits of such 
groups have no demonstrated genetic connection with racial traits. 
Because serious errors of this kind are habitually committed when the 
term race is used in popular parlance, it would be better when 
speaking of human races to drop the term race altogether and speak 
of ethnic groups. (Metraux 1950: 142) 
In contemporary anthropology ethnicity has been broadly defined as a self-
perceived inclusion of those who hold in common a set of traditions not shared by 
others with who they are in contact. (De Vos 2006: 4). Today, ethnic identity is 
understood to involve a shared sense of at least one of the following categories: 
racial uniqueness, territoriality, economic bases, religion, aesthetic cultural patterns 
and language and it can be used consciously or unconsciously as an advantageous 
marketable identity, to create a subjective sense of continuity in belonging, and to 
change the social status of a group or individual (De Vos 2006: 419). However, in 
practice ethnicity is defined variously depending on the context of research (Cohen 
1974: ix).  
Banks (1996) identified three main schools of thought concerning ethnicity that 
emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s: the Manchester Schools Instrumental 
ethnicity (for example see Cohens 1969 work on the Hausa of Nigeria), Barths 
(1969) Norwegian School of Situational Ethnicity and Bromleys (1974) Soviet 
Primordial Ethos theory. The Instrumental approach suggested that social belonging 
and membership, or ethnicity, was a human response to circumstance, which tried to 
maximise individual and group advantage, often economic or political. In this way 
ethnicity is formed by internal organisation and is stimulated by external pressure. 
However, ethnicity was not simply created, or natural, and was built on a pre-
existing form of cultural identity. For the Manchester School, ethnic identity was 
multifaceted and goal orientated (Banks 1996: 24-36). 
The Situational approach developed out of the Norwegian school in publications 
such as Barths (1969) seminal work on the Southern Pathan and ethnicity. Key to 
Barths approach was a conscious, socially constructed ethnicity, subject to 
environmental constraints, and also that ethnic content in both culture and 
personnel, has no a-priori existence or stability. Barth also promoted the examination 
of ethnicity through the investigation of ethnic boundaries and their maintenance 
and not the internal make up of the group. Barth promoted a contextualised 
approach whereby ethnicity was controlled by situation but unlike Instrumental 
ethnicity, Barth implicitly promotes an emic study of ethnicity and suggests that 
ethnicity must be understood through the eyes of the actors on either side of an 
ethnic border. However, Barth has been criticised for giving too much stress to free 
will and choice (Asad 1972) by some who would prefer to stress political 
opportunism, power and dominance to individual choice. Thus, whilst Barths work 
suggests, social stratification and hierarchy are consensual processes in which all 
parties  even those who appear to lose out by such processes  collude, his critics 
suggests that some groups will exert greater pressure over politically inferior others 
for their own gain (Banks 1996: 16).  
The Primordial approach (Banks 1996: 16-24) that characterised the Soviet School, 
promoted by Yulian Bromley (1974, 1975, 1980) and colleagues suggested that ties 
and bonds of consanguinity led to belonging and social identification and thus 
ethnicity. These ethnic ties are maintained through support, co-operation and 
cohesion. This approach suggested that although not eternal, ethnicity was 
extremely resilient and stable and persisted through all social formations. However, 
like Instrumental ethnicity, Bromley suggested the prevailing economic and political 
environment could affect ethnicity. The Soviet School sought to define the most 
typical intrinsic features at the stable core of ethnicity and were interested, albeit to a 
lesser degree than Barth (1969), in the maintenance of social boundaries but were not 
interested in ethnic origins, which Bromley felt were unimportant. However, whilst 
a more detailed examination of all three anthropological approaches to ethnicity 
must consider the prevailing political context of the time, Banks (1996: 23) makes 
particular reference to the contemporary context of Bromleys Primordial approach, 
which was developed under Stalins Soviet Union when political independence was 
suppressed and ethnic stability was promoted across the union. Although this does 
not disprove the Soviet Schools approach this potential bias should be recognised. 
Banks (1996: 187) summarises his understanding of these ethnic studies by 
suggesting that there are three locations of ethnicity that implicitly relate to the three 
main schools of thought (Fig. 3.1).  
1                                                                   Ethnicity in the heart          
2                                                                   Ethnicity in the head 
3                                                                   Ethnicity in the analysts head 
Fig. 3.1: Locations of Ethnicity (Banks 1996: 187) 
Banks (1996: 187) suggests that: Primordialism locates ethnicity in the heart of the 
subject/actor through territorial rootedness; that Situational and Instrumental 
approaches locate ethnicity in the head of the subject/actor and the context of the 
subject/actors ethnic expression; whilst an abstract form of ethnicity might suggest 
that ethnicity is socially unconscious and resides solely in the head of the analyst. If 
primacy should be given to Primordialism then it is possible that ethnicity could be 
accessed archaeologically as it supports a list and trait, internal understanding, of 
ethnicity whilst also recognising the importance of borders. This is similar to 
Childean culture history (see section 3.2 this chapter) that defined cultures as 
bounded entities separated by varying cultural trait lists. However, Primordialism 
suggests an understanding of the ethnic past that is inherently static. Situational and 
Instrumental ethnicity have an implicit focus on the psycho-cultural element of ethnic 
identity and therefore perhaps represents the biggest challenge to archaeology 
because these thoughts and feelings of insider and outsiders are some of the most 
difficult sources to access in the archaeological record. Further, Situational ethnicity

rejects the listing of internal cultural traits saying that they are useless because they 
are changeable both within and between ethnic groups. Finally, an abstract, or 
analytical, ethnicity questions the consciousness of ethnicity entirely. For example, as 
Eltringham (2004: 8) summarises, loyalty to and identification with the ethnic Nuer 
(Evans-Pritchard 1940) or Dinka (Lienhardt 1961) in Africa was not realised by the 
subjects themselves who actually focused their allegiance around kinship and 
locality (Eriksen 1993: 88). However, today ethnicity is clearly not unconscious 
because the word and concept have become self-referential and are now in popular 
usage (Eltringham 2004: 10-11). For example, indigenous groups actively negotiate 
and promote their ethnicity as they compete for political power or cultural 
ownership of commodities such as land, including cultural sites (e.g. Great 
Zimbabwe, Fontein 2006). 
Since these schools of thoughts were developed in the late 1960s, 1970s and 1980s the 
meaning of ethnicity has continued to be adapted and understood differently in 
various situations and current understandings now support a more psycho-cultural 
approach (De Vos and Romanucci-Ross 2006). Indeed ethnic surveys including work 
forms and government censuses do not ask you to qualify your ethnicity through a 
test but merely to state it as you see fit, giving the potential for each individual to 
choose from a range of possible ethnicities to suit their own opinion. This view, has 
been supported by earlier anthropologists such as Edmund Leach (1954), Michael 
Moerman (1965) and Fredrik Barth (1969), who suggested that, there is no necessary 
correspondence between perceived social distinction and observable practices 
(Eltringham 2004: 8), that ethnic distinction has no imperative relationship with 
particular objective criteria (Ardner 1989: 111) and thus, ethnic boundaries are 
between whoever people think they are between (Fardon 1987: 176).  
3.6 Ethno-archaeological Approaches to Ethnicity in Sub-Saharan Africa 
The above discussion suggests that, with the exception of the Primordial approach, 
ethnicity as it is understood within anthropology is difficult to attain within 
archaeology without extremely rich archaeological resources and historical data, a 
combination that is rarely available in Great Lakes Africa. However, ethnicity 
continues to be used within archaeology as an inclusive term to represent various 
forms of group identity, despite the relationship between material culture and 
identity remaining unclear. 
Is there any correlation between material culture patterning and 
identity? Does artefact variability provide a key for reconstructing past 
social boundaries? Asking these perennial questions feels sometimes 
like speaking of werewolves and vampires: a typical do you believe 
in? kind of issue, one that we might consider when relaxing with 
friends or colleagues, but tend to set aside the moment we come back to 
proper scientific work (Gosselain 2000: 187) 
The discussion earlier in this chapter (sections 3.6-7) demonstrates that some 
archaeologists working in Rwanda have believed that material patterning directly 
reflects a one to one relationship with past ethno-racial, or ethno-linguistic, groups 
(e.g. Desmedt 1991; Hiernaux and Maquet 1960). However, ethnoarchaeology has 
demonstrated that this normative understanding of material culture, ethnicity and 
identity cannot be sustained. For example, Michael Dietler and Ingrid Herbich 
studied the Luo potters of Nyanza, Western Kenya (Dietler and Herbich 1989, 1993, 
1994, 1998; Herbich 1987; Herbich and Dietler 1989). The Luo are organised by 
kinship and lineage bonds in a patrilineal society where females are the potters, who 
when they are married and arrive in a new compound, are subject to a strict process 
of social assimilation when they learn the practices and customs of the new local 
family group (Dietler & Herbich 1989). This process creates not an ethnic style but 
local family micro-styles throughout the chane opratoire (Herbich 1987: 195-199). 
Chane opratoire literally refers to the operational chain or sequence, and includes the 
range of processes by which naturally occurring raw materials are selected, shaped 
and transformed into useable cultural products (Renfrew and Bahn 2005: 25). 
Through a chane opratoire approach to technology the processes of manufacture are 
reconstructed as best as possible, aiding the understanding of the social and 
symbolic context of technology and reflecting wider socio-political process (Renfrew 
and Bahn 2005: 26). Amongst the Luo, Dietler and Herbich identified many patterns 
and micro-styles that relate to immediate socio-cultural contexts and the 
implications of this study create problems for archaeologists seeking ethnicity 
through ceramic variation. Herbich (1987: 195-199) found that whilst micro-styles 
may be interpreted archaeologically as an ethno-linguistic or clan grouping in the  
contemporary Luo groups they actually reflected an internal community discourse 
and were not defined by ethnicity.   
In contrast, Gosselain (1992, 1994, 1998, 2002; Gosselain et al. 1996) worked with one 
hundred different potters from twenty-one different ethnic groups in Cameroon 
who spoke seven different languages. He found that at each stage of the process 
there was possible variation and that this was culturally governed as choices 
continued to be made at stages where there was no perceived functional advantage. 
Gosselains results suggest that variations in cultural patterning and style within the 
chane opratoire of the potters did match some socio-cultural boundaries especially 
linguistic boundaries and that the most salient stage was the forming/fashioning 
stage. Gosselain (1998: 71-77) suggests that each stage is differentially susceptible to 
change and transmission and that the most personal and most guarded stages, in 
this case forming/fashioning, will be the most informative regarding identity. 
Gosselain (2000: 198-199) contrasted this situation with the Great Lakes coil built 
pots where he suggested the unity of coil built pots in the region conformed with 
linguistic unity but that roulette decoration diffused as an idea and not as an ethno-
linguistic or population migration, such as suggested by Desmedt (1991).  
Whilst both of these case studies demonstrate that identity is imbued within and 
communicated by material culture, they also demonstrate that many different forms 
of identity may be communicated at single or multiple stages within the 
manufacture process. They also demonstrate that the messages contained within the 
objects are directly relevant to the producer but not necessarily the consumer 
(Dietler & Herbich 1989: 158). Furthermore, whilst Gosselain has identified forming 
as the most salient stage in the chane opratoire it is not clear that this will remain 
stable for all examples. Thus, whilst material culture patterning should be explored 
and is clearly meaningfully constituted it cannot be assumed to relate one to one 
with contemporary or ethnographic groups. The two case studies discussed above 
suggest that pots do not necessarily equal people (David and Kramer 2001; Sterner 
1989).  
Ethnicity has been demonstrated to be a complicated and often psycho-cultural 
phenomenon whilst material culture patterning cannot be assumed to have a one to 
one relation with group identity. Thus, whilst different forms of identity or 
experience may be explored in Rwanda such as those of metallurgists, potters, 
farmers and hunters, and geographically peripheral or central actors, ethnicities such 
as Hutu, Tutsi and Twa are not practically accessible (within Rwanda there 
continues to be a debate over whether or not these identities should be classed as 
ethnicities e.g. Freedman et al. 2006).  
This section has highlighted how ethno-racial and simplistic ethno-linguistic 
modelling is inappropriate in Rwanda for this research because it is untenable 
within an archaeological approach and because it is inappropriate within a 
contemporary political context.  
3.7 A Theoretical Framework 
This chapter has reviewed a series of debates and issues, which have highlighted 
concerns that have been respected as this research identified appropriate research 
objectives and questions. Social historians have demonstrated the effectiveness of 
research that is empirically based, locally themed and broadly inclusive (e.g. 
Chrtien 2003; Vansina 2004; Newbury 2009) (see section 2.1 this chapter). The 
review of archaeological theory has described how the relationship between 
archaeology and ethno-racial thinking has contributed negatively to presentations of 
the past in Rwanda and has indirectly contributed towards political instability (e.g. 
Hiernaux 1956, 1968; Maquet 1961) (see sections 3.3-3 this chapter). Finally, this 
chapter has argued that the search for ethnicities, such as Hutu, Tutsi and Twa, in 
Rwandan archaeology cannot be achieved with any confidence (see sections 3.5-6 
this chapter).  
This chapter has highlighted the benefits and pitfalls of a culture-historical approach 
in Rwanda. Thus, whilst ethno-racial models associated with normative culture-
history have been rejected, the descriptive and empirical benefits of culture-history 
have been harnessed during this research. Within this broad conclusion, these 
discussions have also identified more specific themes that this research has been 
guided by, many of which have been drawn from post-processualism and the social 
historical approach. These inter-related concerns include: self-awareness, 
pragmatism, localised scale of analysis, generation of empirical data, and the 
exploration of a multi-vocal past through holistic strategies that can identify and 
celebrate continuity alongside variation and can contribute positively towards a non-
ethno-racial past:  
Academic and political awareness are two primary concerns for this research. 
Whilst the research objectives and questions must be based on a sound academic 
platform they must also be sensitive to contemporary Rwanda and aware of how 
they may be received by a non-academic audience. Research cannot exist in a 
political or theoretical vacuum (see Chapter 1). Thus, having explored the 
contemporary and theoretical context of research in Chapters 2 and 3, this research 
reviews the extant archaeological evidence for the Iron Age in Chapter 4, before 
presenting a series of appropriate research questions that were identified. 
Pragmatism was also key to the success of this research, because it was essential that 
the research objectives and questions respected the practical realities of the work. For 
example, this research had to be manageable within a PhD timeframe and financial 
resources. Moreover, the fieldwork needed to be practicable within contemporary 
Rwanda. Whilst rapid post-conflict development and vast infrastructural investment 
have taken place, Rwanda is one of the most densely populated countries in Africa 
with the majority of the population still living in rural areas without electricity and 
clean water, a situation that posed specific logistical constraints. Preservation of 
archaeological materials and deposits was also a concern, directing the research 
towards materials most likely to be encountered.  
Localised scales of research were an analytical goal. Successive authorities and 
archaeological approaches have made sweeping generalisations about Rwandas 
past (see Chapter 2 section 2.3). However, social historians have demonstrated that a 
complex and dynamic, multi-vocal past existed and can be accessed through more 
nuanced approaches (see section 3.2-3 this Chapter). Thus, in order to access a more 
textured past and to explore the variety of experience, this research identified 
research objectives and questions that were focused on localised and site based 
scales of analysis.  
Social historians and educationalists working in Rwanda demonstrated a multi-
narrative past to be both achievable and desirable (e.g. Freedman et al. 2006, 2009; 
Newbury 2009) (see Chapter 2 section 2.5 and section 3.1 this chapter). Thus, this 
research developed research questions that targeted various periods and localities in 
Rwandas pre-colonial past. Furthermore, it also targeted a range of archaeological 
materials to maximise the research potential for encountering a variety of 
experiences and facets in pre-colonial Rwanda.   
Empirical data formed the backbone of this research. The construction of history in 
20th century Rwanda has often been influenced more by ethnographic analogy and 
ethno-racial assumptions than empirical data (e.g. Hiernaux 1956; Maquet 1961). 
However, in order to foster confidence in the re-construction of Rwandas pre-
colonial past, new histories must be based on empirical data (Newbury 2009). 
Furthermore, empirical data is essential if the past is to be effectively negotiated by 
the public in Rwanda as part of the participant approach advocated by 
educationalists in Chapter 2 (section 2.5). The generation of empirical data was 
achieved through the application of methodologies and basic research questions 
associated with culture history, such as chronological questions, survey and test-
excavation methods.  
The exploration of non-ethno-racial pasts was a pre-requisite for research in 
contemporary Rwanda. In respect of the political context of this research (see 
Chapter 2), and supported by the discussions of ethnicity earlier in this chapter 
(section 3.6), this research rejected the ethno-racial models that characterised 
normative culture-history in Rwanda (e.g. Hiernaux and Maquet 1957, 1960; 
Nenquin 1967a; Van Noten 1983). Instead it sought to describe the historical 
particulars of the sites and materials identified and the complex dynamic identities 
that they potentially represent. Thus the search for external origins and influences 
was not a research concern here and the one-to-one association of material culture 
with actual or nameless peoples was not attempted.   
A holistic approach to the identification of research questions and strategies helped 
maximise the potential for this research to access various meanings communicated 
through material culture patterning. Ethnoarchaeology has demonstrated that 
material culture is meaningfully constituted and that meaning may be 
communicated by one or more stages within the technological production process 
(e.g. Dietler and Herbitch 1989; David and Kramer 2001) (see section 3.6 this 
Chapter). Thus this research attempted to access meaning through a chane opratoire 
approach to the study of technological remains such as ceramics, enabling a 
maximised range of potentially meaningful material culture patterns to be explored 
and thus also analyse for site based and localised scales of material culture 
patterning. The holistic approach was also applied more generally, as stated above, 
in the development of an inclusive field and general analytical methodology. 
The identification of material culture continuity and variation provided an over 
arching background to the research objectives and questions identified during this 
research. The colonial construction presented pre-colonial Rwanda as a divided, 
racially and economically opposed, society (Mamdani 2001; Eltringham 2004). This 
construction has been supported by normative culture-historical approaches that 
have sought to define the past into known cultural units, often on the basis of 
ceramic types alone (see section 3.3 this chapter). These constructions have defined 
the past by boundaries, both real and invented. In contrast the contemporary 
government, in an attempt to foster reconciliation, have presented a past that 
highlights historical unity, for example within clans and through the suggestion of 
egalitarianism (Freedman et al. 2006) (See Chapter 2 section 2.4). However, recent 
archaeological work has demonstrated that meaningful continuities exist alongside 
variations within the Iron Age (e.g. Ashley 2005). Instead of suggesting internal 
cultural homogeneity, this approach allows for a greater appreciation of the internal 
heterogeneity of society, promoted by social historians (e.g. Schoenbrun 1998; 
Newbury 2009), meaning that archaeologists can begin to appreciate the dynamic 
roles that pre-colonial Iron Age societies played in the active negotiation of their life-
ways, both producing, and responding to change, instead of being presented as 
passive groups helpless before the environment.  
Chapter 4 
Reviewing the Evidence 
Having explored the contemporary and theoretical reasons why an archaeological 
re-investigation of the Rwandan Iron Age is relevant today (see Chapters 2 & 3), this 
chapter will now discuss the extant evidence for the pre-colonial past in Great Lakes 
Africa and specifically Rwanda. The pre-colonial period dealt with during this thesis 
is the archaeological era currently referred to as the Iron Age, which spans 
approximately 500 BC to 1900 AD (e.g. Van Noten 1983; Clist 1987; Van 
Grunderbeek 1992). This era is of relevance to this research because it covers the 
period running up to European contact which has been most negatively influenced 
by 20th century presentations of the pre-colonial past (see Chapter 2 section 2.3). 
Whilst the preceding Stone Ages are also important, because they further our 
understanding of human experience within the modern borders of Rwanda, they are 
simply beyond the scope of this PhD research.  
This chapter will now review core archaeological Iron Age research themes 
including dating, ceramics, metallurgy, environment, site location, subsistence and 
socio-political organisation. Through which a series of pertinent and practical 
research questions, that follow the theoretical framework set out in Chapter 3, will 
be identified. 
4.1 Terminology 
In contested reconstructions of Rwandan prehistory (e.g. Hiernaux and Maquet 
1957, 1960; Nenquin 1967a; Van Noten 1983) the past has been divided into a series 
of ages: Early Stone Age and Late Stone Age, followed by Early Iron Age and Late 
Iron Age. The origins of these technological ages are rooted in the Three Age 
Scheme (Trigger, 1989: 75) and reflect European influences over early research in 
the region. However, whilst European prehistory has been further sub-divided into 
overlapping non-technological periods, this has been slow to take place in Great 
Lakes Africa. Yet, despite the continuing usage of technological ages in sub-Saharan 
Africa there is growing dissatisfaction because they give undue primacy to 
technological developments at the expense of socio-political achievements (Sinclair 
et al. 1993: 8-9). Furthermore, they oversimplify the past by implying that it is static 
except for rare episodes of dramatic technological change. Although de Maret (1996: 
265) has tried to overcome this problem by proposing transitional stone to metal 
ages his terminology is still focused on technological developments. However, 
simply replacing this system with non-technologically defined terms will not avoid 
the abrupt disjunction that these types of chronological frameworks imply. 
Inevitably all chronological frameworks are imperfect because they explicitly seek to 
simplify the past into artificial units. 
The reliance on technology as a defining factor in prehistory has negatively 
influenced archaeological interpretations in Rwanda. For example, Nenquin (1967a: 
15-254) identified a large number of sites with Early and Late Stone Age materials, 
which he universally referred to as mixed deposits, i.e. produced by post-
depositional mixing as opposed to layers in which different cultures were 
contributing at the same time. In this example Nenquin (1967a) has allowed his 
interpretation to be constrained by the established chronological framework instead 
of using his data to develop a more complex and representative framework.  
However, a discussion of the history of archaeology in the region, such as presented 
in this chapter, necessitates the use of the Early Iron Age/ Late Iron Age dichotomy 
that has structured previous debates. Nevertheless, the inadequacies of this 
technological and overly simple system are recognised, and thus this thesis will aim 
to use the results of this research where appropriate to develop the current 
framework so it more appropriately reflects the complexity of prehistory in Rwanda 
and Great Lakes Africa.  
4.2 Dating 
Whilst the Iron Age is clearly a term linked to the appearance and persistence of iron 
technology throughout the region, the identification of the Iron Age archaeologically 
is more frequently associated with the identification of Iron Age ceramics. This is 
because iron production waste is not always found at sites dating to the Iron Age 
and where it is recovered it is rarely chronologically diagnostic (for an exception to 
this see the decorated Early Iron Age furnace bricks from southern Rwanda, 
Raymakers and Van Noten 1986). Furthermore, ceramics are the most common 
archaeological material found at Iron Age sites in Great Lakes Africa and they are 
more chronologically diagnostic. (However, despite Ashleys 2005 significant 
contribution to ceramic studies in Great Lakes Africa, ceramic chronologies remain 
poorly understood in Rwanda.) Therefore discussions of Iron Age dating are 
inextricably tied to the appearance of Urewe and roulette-decorated ceramics, 
marking the beginning of the Early and Late Iron Ages respectively.  
Leakey et al. (1948) first formally identified Urewe at Siaya, Kenya (although they 
called it dimple-based ware) and immediately recognised its stratigraphic 
association with iron and thus an Iron Age. Whilst no absolute dating was available, 
Urewe was believed to antedate modern times by a considerable period because a 
separate pottery type, roulette-decorated ceramics, was found in between. The first 
absolute date associated with Urewe came from Nsongezi rock-shelter in Uganda 
(Pearce and Posnansky 1963), which dated a Late Stone Age hearth immediately 
underlying an Urewe deposit to AD 1025 +/- 150 (M-113) (Crane and Griffin 1962). 
This gave a terminus post-quem for Urewe that meant the remainder of the Iron Age 
had to be squeezed into the next 1000 years. However, this date from Nsongezi was 
quickly contradicted by further research and is now believed to be erroneous (Van 
Grunderbeek 1992: 53). Soper (1969: 149) published the first dates for Urewe material 
from Siaya and these clustered around the early 1st millennium AD. Almost 1000 
years earlier than the Nsongezi date. Subsequently Hiernaux (1968) produced the 
first dates for Urewe in Rwanda and these again fell in the first centuries AD (AD 
300 +/- 80 for Cyamakuza (B-758) and AD 250 +/- 100 for Ndora (B-755)). Following 
these initial results a flurry of dates were produced from sites in Kenya, such as at 
Urewe by Soper (1971) and at Gogo Falls by Collett and Robertshaw (1980) amongst 
many others.  
De Maret et al. (1977) attempted the first synthesis of radiocarbon dates from 
Rwanda in their regional compilation of material from west central Africa. Whilst an 
early 3rd century BC date (GrN 5752) existed from an empty pit at Rurembo this was 
excluded because it did not have a clear relationship with any archaeological 
remains. Thus de Maret et al. (1977: 496) concluded, based on the available cluster of 
dates that the Early Iron Age was well established in central and southern Rwanda 
by the 3rd century AD. For the start of the Late Iron Age de Maret et al. (1977) 
considered two 9th and 12th century dates from Akameru, a cave in northern Rwanda 
(GrN 7671, GrN 7672) (later reported by Van Noten 1983) and supported these dates 
with a 13th century AD date from the nearby Matupi cave, DRC (GrN 7244). All of 
these Late Iron Age dates were in association with roulette-decorated ceramics. 
However, unlike later analysts (e.g. Van Noten 1983; Van Grunderbeek 1992), de 
Maret et al. (1977: 490) did not use the earliest of these dates to posit an appearance 
of roulette-decorated pottery in 9th century AD Rwanda but pointed out that the later 
date from Akameru had actually been generated from samples stratigraphically 
beneath the early date. They suggested that this anomaly was the result of the 
relatively small size of the samples and the high standard deviation that these 
produced. Thus they placed the start of the Late Iron Age in Rwanda at the 
beginning of the 2nd millennium AD (de Maret et al. 1977: 490).  
Clist (1987) and Van Grunderbeek (1992) have produced more recent syntheses of 
Early Iron Age radiocarbon results. Clist (1987) attempted a Critical Reappraisal of the 
Chronological Framework of the Early Urewe Iron Age Industry and Van Grunderbeek 
(1992) has investigated the chronological limits of the Early Iron Age in Great Lakes 
Africa with specific focus on Rwanda and Burundi. The two approaches represent a 
methodological clash because Van Grunderbeek is explicitly inclusive whilst Clist 
works within a critical framework. Clist scores dates based on their reliability and 
questions those that have a low rate of confidence based on their context or high 
standard deviation. However, Van Grunderbeek uncritically accepts the vast 
majority of available dates and is inconsistent with her use of these dates. For 
example, whilst Van Grunderbeek published the 1 and 2 sigma ranges for each date 
she switches between the higher or lower margin of these dates uncritically to best 
fit her own explanations (MacLean 1996a: 45). Furthermore, she uncritically accepts 
dates that are extremely isolated from the established time frames without 
sufficiently exploring the potential for contamination. For example, through their 
archaeometallurgical work Van Grunderbeek et al. (1983) produced radiocarbon 
dates that they believed pushed the Early Iron Age in Rwanda and Burundi back 
into the first and second millennium BC. Whilst some of these very early dates such 
as one from Muguza (1665205 BC) have now been rejected on the grounds of old 
wood or other forms of contamination (Van Grunderbeek et al 2001: 82), Van 
Grunderbeek et al. continue to support their early dates from Rwiyange I (1230145 
BC and 905285 BC) and Mubuga V (1210145 BC) (Van Grunderbeek et al. 2001: 
276). However, these very early dates have been met with much scepticism, not least 
because the palaeoecological evidence suggests that there was a lot of volcanic 
activity was taking place around 1000BC increasing the chance of natural charcoal 
during that period persisting into later times (Taylor et al. 1999: 313). Furthermore, 
1st millennium BC fluctuations in atmospheric radiocarbon around 800-300BC 
caused by volcanic activity obstruct precise radiocarbon dating during this period 
(Killick 2009: 46).  
Van Grunderbeek is equally contentious with her dates for the end of the Early Iron 
Age in Rwanda. She suggests that Urewe-using communities are present up until the 
15th century AD based on an isolated single date from Mirima II (AD 1380110) that 
has been calibrated to AD 1400, despite the next nearest dates from Rwanda being 
calibrated to AD 770190 and AD 570170 (Van Grunderbeek 1992: 58-59). 
Grunderbeeks very early and very late dates are clearly unreliable and thus the 
results of Clists (1987) critical review are preferred here. This synthesis dates the 
Early Iron Age regionally from 500 BC to 1000 AD, the later date based on results 
from western Tanzania (e.g. Schmidt 1978: 291). However, in Rwanda and much of 
the northern shores of Lake Victoria there is no presence of Urewe past the 8th 
century AD.  
The beginning of the Late Iron Age is signalled by the appearance of roulette-
decorated ceramics, which continue to be produced today. Some scholars suggest 
that Urewe was rapidly replaced by roulette-decorated ceramics at the end of the 1st 
millennium AD (Phillipson 1993: 225). However, with the exception of two isolated, 
and thus questioned, Rwandan radiocarbon dates from the 7th and 9th centuries AD 
(Van Grunderbeek 1992; Van Noten 1983) the earliest dates for roulette-decorated 
ceramics fall at the beginning of the 2nd millennium AD (e.g. from Ntusi 11th century 
Reid 1994/5). Therefore, at present, within the current ceramic framework, there is 
an archaeological hiatus between the end of the Early Iron Age and the start of the 
Late Iron Age. Wotzka (2006: 271-289) suggests that this relates to depopulation of 
the region at the end of the 1st millennium AD. However, in contrast Ashley (2005: 
43) suggests that this 200-300 year gap is not the result of depopulation but 
represents a lack of research focus on this period. This research lacuna is 
understandable considering that until recently archaeologists were more concerned 
with the origins of the Early and Late Iron Ages and not a transitory phase between 
them. Furthermore, this short phase is likely to be less well represented in the 
archaeological record, and therefore more difficult to identify, when compared to the 
much longer Early and Late Iron Ages. Whilst research has attempted to address this 
phase through the identification of post-Urewe ceramics in Uganda (e.g. Posnansky 
1967; et al. 2005; Ashley 2005) there has been no work on this period in Rwanda.   
This summary has highlighted two main dating issues: 
1. When did the Early Iron Age begin? 
Question one has already received a lot of attention within Great Lakes Africa at the 
expense of developing our understanding the Early Iron Age itself. This issue is also 
impractical for this research. For example, early deposits are generally encountered 
incidentally and not by design. Furthermore, due to dating concerns already 
discussed for the 1st millennium BC, many more well stratified sites are needed to 
develop this debate, which will necessarily be the result of many more 
archaeological projects. Thus, where early dates are encountered during this 
research they will be contextualised within this debate but are not a focus of this 
thesis. 
2. Was there a transitory phase in the late 1st millennium AD?  
Question two is receiving growing attention in Great Lakes Africa archaeological 
studies but is yet to be explored in Rwanda. This topic represents an excellent 
opportunity through which to examine continuity and variation in Iron Age Rwanda 
in conformity with the theoretical framework established in Chapter 3. Therefore, 
where deposits and assemblages dating to this period are identified during this 
research these will be targeted and examined in detail.  
4.3 Technology 
Archaeologically identifiable technologies in the Iron Age include metallurgy, 
pottery and lithics. However, stone tools in Iron Age contexts are rare in Rwanda 
and where they do occur, as at Masangano, they have been attributed to post-
depositional mixing and have been largely ignored (e.g. Van Noten 1983). Thus, 
lithics will not be dealt with here.  
4.4 Early Iron Age Ceramic Studies 
Urewe ceramics have been classified under different names in Great Lakes Africa. 
Leakey et al (1948) were the first to name them, calling them dimple-based ware 
on account of the distinctive basal cavity observed in many examples in their 
assemblage (Fig. 4.1). However, this term attracted criticism because it incorrectly 
suggested that dimple bases were the only diagnostic feature and were present on 
every vessel, when they actually only form a relatively small part of any assemblage 
(Soper 1969: 148; 1971: 6; Posnansky 1967: 644; 1973: 578). As an alternative 
Posnansky, supported by Soper (albeit tentatively), and following the trend of the 
times, suggested the use of the type-site name Urewe (a Siaya site excavated by 
Leakey et al. 1948) (see Shinnie 1978: 58). Subsequently, despite initial reservations, 
Anglophone archaeologists quickly adopted the term Urewe.  
Fig. 4.1 Illustration showing a Classic Urewe hemispherical bowl with a dimple-base from Kabuye, 
Rwanda (reproduced from Van Noten 1983: Plate 11) 
In Rwanda, although Early Iron Age ceramics were encountered as early as the 1930s 
(e.g. Boutakoff 1937) they were not formally identified until much later by Hiernaux 
and Maquet (1957, 1960: 31) who named them type A, although a close similarity 
with Leakey et al.s (1948) dimple-based ware was noted. Despite a continuing 
preference for A-Ware, alongside dimple-based ware and Urewe ceramics, in 
discussions of Rwandan archaeology (e.g. Nenquin 1967a; Van Grunderbeek et al. 
1983; Van Noten 1983; Misago pers comm. 2009) only the term Urewe will be used 
throughout this research. Although type-site names have their own pitfalls, such as 
the association with a particular location and not an actual distribution, the use of 
Urewe is preferred here because it identifies this ceramic as a Great Lakes Africa 
phenomenon through the use of a unique and relevant place name. Furthermore, it 
is also the most commonly used term today outside of Rwanda, allowing the results 
of this research to be more directly contextualised within region wide debates.  
Urewe is the only ceramic associated with the Early Iron Age in Rwanda and is 
present over much of Great Lakes Africa during this period. Subsequently, Urewe 
has become the chief indicator of the Early Iron Age in this region. However, beyond 
its use as a dating tool it has been little explored and its socio-economic role as a craft 
specialisation has been largely ignored (although see Maclean 1996b and Ashley 
2005 for suggestions).  
The main Urewe research themes can be summarised by seven related questions: 
1. How can Urewe be defined?  
Question one refers to the physical definition of Urewe. Since Urewe was first 
formally identified analysts have differed on the range of decoration and forms, 
amongst other variables, that best define Urewe. Whilst this research is unlikely to 
encounter sufficient material to contribute significantly to this debate it is important 
to describe the salient Urewe features so that any assemblages identified during this 
research can be compared and contrasted with the established typology. 
Defining Urewe: Classic Urewe ceramics have three main diagnostic features: 
dimple bases, bevelled rims and decorative motifs that include channelling, scroll 
and circle patterns, triangles, cross hatching and punctured dots (Fig 4.2) (Leakey et 
al. 1948: 22; Posnansky 1961a: 183). (The term Classic Urewe was first used by 
Posnansky (1973) to distinguish between the most common form of Urewe and 
potential variants, and it will be used similarly here.) Classic Urewe is clearly a 
quality product, demonstrating a high degree of expertise in the application of these 
features with as many as eight bevels on some vessels and others showing 
burnishing and slipping. In Kenya, Leakey et al. (1948: 23) identified five Urewe 
vessel forms: wide mouthed bowls, narrow mouthed bowls, bowls with flared rims, 
globular pots with flared rims and beakers. This can be contrasted with Posnanskys 
(1968: 2) simplified range that included globular cooking-pots, shallow open dishes 
and long vases. Whilst Posanskys definition is interesting because it attributes a 
function, cooking, to some of the vessels, it is too narrow in scope and reduces the 
form range to three vague categories. Van Grunderbeek (1988: 47-49) employed a 
less ambiguous classification range for Urewe from Rwanda and Burundi, which 
was later adopted by Ashley (2005), and included closed mouth bowls (e.g. Fig. 4.2: 
3), hemispherical bowls (e.g. Fig. 4.1), open bowls (e.g. Fig. 4.3, 1,2 and 4) and 
globular jars with everted necks (Fig. 4.2: 1) with an expected 60:40 ratio of jars to 
bowls from Rwanda and Burundi. Other work in Rwanda has identified carinated 
shoulder vessels from Nyirankuba (Hiernaux and Maquet 1960: 47) and collared jars 
(Nenquin 1967a) (Fig. 4.4), believed to be the same as Van Grunderbeeks (1988) 
necked jars. The present research, following Ashley (2005), will adopt Van 
Grunderbeeks (1988) classification range because it has been designed with specific 
reference to Rwanda and Burundi and will allow the results of this research to be 
compared and contrasted with Ashleys extensive regional study. However, where 
forms are identified that cannot be attributed to one of these groups the range will be 
adapted and enhanced to include them.

globular jar (1) and a carinated/collared jar (2) (reproduced from Nenquin 1967a: 261 Fig 152) 
2. When did Urewe first appear in the region? 
Question two is a dating issue that has already been described above in relation to 
the beginning of the Early Iron Age and will not be discussed further here.  
3. Was Urewe locally developed within the region or was it derived from 
outside?  
Question three is concerned with the origin of the Urewe ceramic tradition. 
Although this debate has received a lot of early attention it has received relatively 
little consensus. This question is beyond the scope of this research because currently 
there are too many geographical gaps in the archaeological record. Furthermore, it 
contradicts the theoretical framework set out in Chapter 3 that seeks to explore non-
ethnically defined pasts. Therefore, whilst the origins and identity debate will be 
outlined here because it is a central theme in Early Iron Age ceramic studies, it will 
not be directly tackled during this research.  
Urewe Origins and Identity: In Great Lakes Africa ceramic technology first 
appeared in the Late Stone Age. However, Late Stone Age ceramics have not been 
identified in Rwanda although they exist close by at Kansyore Island in southwest 
Uganda (Chapman 1967). Whilst Kansyore Ware is important because it 
demonstrates the adoption and development of a new technology during the Late 
Stone Age, it is often believed to be of limited relevance to Iron Age studies because 
it doesnt appear to have any continuity with the later wares (Robertshaw 1991b). 
(Although recent work by Lane et al. 2007 on the eastern shores of Lake Victoria in 
Kenya has shown there to be significant continuities between Kansyore and Urewe 
using populations in a single archaeological sequence). Thus, in the absence of an 
indigenous pre-cursor to Urewe, archaeological research has explored whether 
Urewe was independently invented in Great Lakes Africa or originated from 
elsewhere.  
Fig. 4.5 Map showing spatial extension of Urewe site (sites shown as black dots) (reproduced from Clist 
1987: 39) 
The distribution of Urewe stretches from Western Kenya and the eastern shores of 
Lake Victoria (Leakey et al 1948; Lane et al. 2007) to the western shores of Lake Kivu 
in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) (Hiernaux and Maquet 1957). It is also 
found in north Ugandan sites such as at Murchisons Falls (Soper 1971) and as far 
south as the southern shores of Lake Victoria in Northern Tanzania (Soper and 
Golden 1969) (Fig. 4.5). Thus, Urewe is a regional phenomenon, however, its origins 
are not clear. Van Noten (1979) suggested that it was locally developed in Great 
Lakes Africa and remained confined to that region. However, others have 
hypothesised that Urewe is a product of a Bantu Package that migrated across 
Africa, carried along as part of an advantageous linguistic, economic, technological 
and social model (e.g. Oliver 1966) and thus has wider relations. Although the 
Bantu package has since been shown by linguistic studies to be flawed because 
agriculture, iron-working, cattle-keeping and Bantu languages have different time 
depths in Great Lakes Africa (e.g. Schoenbrun 1998) this suggestion was prevalent 
until recently. For example, Phillipson (1977) associated Urewe with the Chifumbazi 
complex; Posnansky (1961d), Fagan and Lofgren (1966) and Soper (1973: 193) 
compared Urewe with channelled wares, from eastern DRC commonly linked to 
Zambian wares; and Van Grunderbeek (1988) has suggested connections with 
ceramics found as far west as Cameroon and Nigeria and as far east as Sudan and 
Ethiopia. However, there is little consensus on any of these routes. For example, 
Soper (1971: 30-32) stated that there was no resemblance to pre-Aksumite northern 
Ethiopia but saw connections with Sudan at Jebel Moya and thus believed the 
southern Sudanese belt to be the most likely origin. Soper (1971: 33) also concluded 
that before any origin could usefully be identified more work was needed in 
Congo, Angola, central Tanzania, Mozambique and the southern Sudan belt north 
of the equatorial rainforest. It is notable that since that time much of these areas 
have seen violent conflict and little work has been possible.  
4. Is Urewe a Great Lakes Africa ceramic manifestation or does it form part of 
a larger phenomenon?  
Question four, whilst related to question 3, concerns more general Urewe 
relationships that may exist in the wider region. This topic will not form a main 
research objective here because this is a targeted study focusing on Rwanda, a 
relatively small geographic area. However, the history of the debate will be outlined 
so that any relevant results generated can be contextualised within it.  
Other Urewe Relations: Many different types of Early Iron Age ceramics have been 
identified across eastern, southern and central Africa and since the 1960s a debate 
has continued as to whether these should be considered related or separate 
phenomena. For example, in his early review Philipson (1977) identified twelve in 
eastern and southern Africa alone. Soper (1969, 1971, 1973) devoted a lot of time to 
this topic and suggested that Kwale ware from south eastern Kenya, dimple-based 
ware from Siaya north-west Kenya and Sandaweland-Typus from central 
Tanzania were all elements of a single closely related complex (Soper 1973: 193). 
This complex was based on shared incised decoration but failed to recognise the 
highly variable motifs and to appreciate the significance of variation in vessel shape, 
rim form and base. These, Soper (1973: 195-196) explains, are insignificant 
differences created by distance and differing environments. Whilst Soper (1973: 198) 
accepted that there was not enough data to fully establish the nature of these 
relationships he was convinced they were related. Soper also postulated links 
between Urewe and ceramic traditions in Southern Africa and suggested that Early 
Iron Age wares were spread via Kalambo to Gokomere. Soper (1971: 29) saw this as 
a pulsating wave or front, pumping out continuous waves of variation creating a 
Southern African Iron Age Complex. Today the debate continues with Huffman 
(1989: 156; 2007) suggesting that Urewe is the ancestor of the entire eastern stream of 
Phillipsons (1977) two stream hypothesis that explained the migration of the 
eastern Bantu language group, which arrived in southern Africa around the 
beginning of the 2nd millennium AD (Fig. 4.6). 
Fig. 4.6. Map showing Phillipsons (1977) Early Iron Age migrations (reproduced from Huffman 1989: 
161, Fig 2) 
In Rwanda there has been little consideration of the relationship between Early Iron 
Age ceramics and those immediately outside of Great Lakes Africa. Whilst regional 
similarities may exist within Early Iron Age wares it is believed that the Rwandan 
and Great Lakes African archaeological record is still too incomplete to allow 
confident ceramic connections to be postulated without demonstrable geographic, 
and preferably stratigraphic, relationships. Furthermore, this is also problematic 
ground where archaeology often goes array, searching for origins and outside 
relations at the expense of developing our understanding of internal dynamics.    
5. Is Urewe a homogenous ceramic type or can meaningful variation be 
identified within it?  
Question five concerns the detailed definition of Urewe and the potential for spatial 
and temporal variation within this ceramic type that was once assumed to be a 
homogenous ceramic phenomenon. This question is consistent with the theoretical 
framework set out in Chapter 3 that seeks to investigate and celebrate variation 
alongside continuity. Thus, this debate will be discussed in detail below and will 
become a major focus of this research.  
Urewe: Homogeneity versus Variation 
Au Rwanda et au Burundi, la civilisation de lAge du Fer Ancien a 
laiss comme tmoin une cramique caractristique prsentant une 
uniformit  peine rompue par des variants dexcutions locales. Dj 
dans les formes se reflte lhomognit de la culture Urewe. (Van 
Grunderbeek et al. 1983: 25) 
Today the regional unity of Urewe is widely accepted. However, the supposed 
homognit of Urewe has been seriously questioned and the possibility that 
meaningful variation exists within Urewe continues to be explored (e.g. Ashley 
2005). Leakey et al. (1948) were amongst the first to identify regional similarities 
between Great Lakes Africa dimple-based Early Iron Age wares when they 
suggested parallels between their Kenyan material and pots from Nsongezi rock-
shelter in Uganda, and this regional relationship was quickly realised by 
archaeologists working in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda (e.g. Soper 1971). Having 
established the regional unity of Urewe, work has since focused on the potential for 
meaningful variation within Urewe. Although some have speculated about the 
possibility of chronological Urewe variation (e.g. Posnansky 1967: 632 and Soper 
1971: 14), this debate has largely been dominated by arguments for and against 
geographical variation. For example, Van Noten (1979) recognised the overall 
generality of the Early Iron Age ceramics but suggested that culturally and 
geographically significant divisions within these could be identified. Van Noten 
studied Urewe type ceramics from Rwanda, Burundi and eastern DRC and 
identified eight different sub-types within these. Van Noten (1979: 71) used these 
ceramic sub-types to support his Interlacustrine Early Iron Age Industrial 
Complex. However, Van Notens model has been criticised because it is not based 
on a critical analytical framework and utilises undated sites with limited ceramic 
assemblages (with the exception of Tshamfu and Nyirankuba) and it fails to 
recognise the diversity within these sub-types, such as at Nyirankuba (Van 
Grunderbeek 1983: 25; 1988). Van Notens (1979) site based distinctions can be 
contrasted with Van Grunderbeeks (1988) multi-variant, regional approach to 
Urewe ceramics from Rwanda, Burundi and DRC. Van Grunderbeek (1988: 47-49) 
found substantial generalised patterning across the region alongside site-based 
variation. However, she concluded that the evidence did not support assertions, 
such as Van Notens (1979), that subtler diachronic or regional distinctions existed. 
However, Ashley (2005), in the most recent multi-variant analysis of Iron Age 
ceramics in the region, did identify meaningful variation at a local, site-based scale 
on the northern shores of Lake Victoria. For example, Ashley, through the 
employment of a chine opratoire approach to her ceramics (see Chapter 3 section 
3.6), identified Contact Urewe (Fig. 4.7) a ceramic that is contemporary with 
Urewe and preserves many of the same ceramic traits but is lacking in the high 
levels of investment and technical skill normally seen in Urewe (Lane et al. 2007: 77). 
This combined with evidence of foraging alongside limited stock keeping, led 
Ashley (2005: 292-293) to suggest that the makers of this ceramic did not have long-
term familiarity with Urewe but had contact with groups who did, resulting in the 
adoption of some of the trappings of a farming lifestyle and subsequently the 
production of a creolised ceramic unique to the region (Lane et al. 2007: 77). Whilst 
Lane et al (2007: 78) tentatively postulate a similar situation for the nearby site of 
Ugunja (Mosely & Davison 1992: 134), Contact Urewe remains a localised, 
historically situated phenomenon. Nevertheless, this example demonstrates the 
potential for localised Urewe variations that may also exist within Rwanda.

(reproduced from Lane et al 2007: 77, Fig. 6) 
6. What happened to Urewe at the end of the Early Iron Age? 
Question six is related to the terminal 1st millennium hiatus (discussed in section 4.2) 
and is related to Question 5 above. However, here it is specifically concerned with 
the continuation or disappearance of Urewe technology. This topic has received 
some archaeological attention elsewhere in the region but has not been considered in 
relation to the Rwandan material. Thus, the regional data will be summarized here 
and where suitable Rwandan archaeological resources are encountered they will 
become a major focus of this thesis.  
Urewe: Ceramic Transition 
The dating discussion earlier in this chapter (section 4.2) established the existence of 
an archaeological hiatus between the disappearance of Urewe and the appearance of 
roulette-decoration ceramics in Rwanda, leaving a 200-300 year gap in the record 
that must be addressed. Within ceramic studies Posnansky was the first to suggest 
the existence of a post-Urewe ceramic. Posnansky (1967: 632, 1973; et al. 2005) 
identified a devolved form of Urewe on Lolui Island, Uganda (Fig. 4.8) that he 
believed represented a later ceramic related to the loss of ceramic production skills 
over time. However, his initial findings were questioned (e.g. by Soper 1971: 14) 
because they were not demonstrated stratigraphically and because no absolute dates 
existed. Yet, subsequent work by Ashley (2005: 299-304) has also identified a 
devolved Urewe, part of her Lutoboka Complex on the Entebbe peninsula that 
has been dated to the terminal 1st millennium AD. Devolved Urewe can be described 
as having a high level of similarity with Classic Urewe whilst being poorer in 
execution and overall quality. For example, the most complicated elements of 
Urewe, bevelled rims, dimple bases and complicated incised motifs are drastically 
reduced and the vessel form range is decreased, although jars remain common 
(Ashley 2005: 302). 
Fig. 4.8 Devolved Urewe ceramics from Lolui Island, Uganda (reproduced from Posnansky et al. 2005: 
86-87: Figs 7 and 8) 
Devolved Urewe has never been identified or indeed looked for in Rwanda. 
However, a number of sites exist with ceramics that dont fit the established 
Urewe/roulette-decorated dichotomy, such as Kabuye, (Fig. 4.9) Masangano (Fig. 
4.10) Bugarama (Fig. 4.11) and Kiguhu (Fig 4.12) (Nenquin 1967a; Van Noten 1983; 
Simon 1983). These ceramics have commonly been lumped together under the term 
C-Ware and display incision and punctate decoration, with occasional dimpling 
on the bases and whilst they are clearly not Urewe they bear more resemblance to 
that tradition than they do to later roulette-decorated ceramics. None of these 
ceramics have been dated and those from Kiguhu are from mixed surface remains 
(Simon 1983: 145-147). Of these sites, the Bugarama ceramics represent the 
assemblage with the greatest stratigraphic potential being identified in deposits 
directly underlying Late Iron Age levels containing roulette-decorated ceramics 
(Simon 1983: 137-144). Whilst it is too early to posit a relationship between these 
ambiguous ceramics and Urewe, the existence of ceramics in Rwanda that do not fit 
the established framework represents a potentially interesting avenue of research. 
Therefore, these sites will be returned to during this research in the hope of 
collecting stratigraphiclly secure, dateable assemblages, which may aid the 
exploration of the archaeological hiatus at the end of the Early Iron Age.

7. What is the social meaning of Urewe pottery to its makers and users?  
Question seven concerns the social and symbolic significance of Urewe. Due to poor 
contextual data, such as a lack of detailed Urewe settlement data (see section 4.10 for 
further discussion), little is known about this issue. However, it is an important topic 
if we are to gain further insights into the lives of Urewe users, and to move beyond 
simply describing the ceramics themselves. Thus, the extant data will be briefly 
summarised below and where Urewe ceramics are identified in socially meaningful 
contexts during this research this subject will be explored. 
The social and symbolic context of Urewe remains illusive. Urewe ceramics can be 
assumed to have been symbolically important to its makers and users, based on the 
high level of technical investment necessary for its production, including the 
intricate decoration afforded it, and the functional potential it provided, such as in 
the storage, cooking, and serving of food. However, in the absence of detailed 
contextual data such suggestions remain speculative, based on modern values 
drawn from ethnographic analogy.  
Nevertheless, it is possible to begin exploring Urewe ceramics as a socially 
embedded material. For example, the occurrence of deliberately deposited Urewe 
ceramics represents an intriguing set of circumstantial evidence: e.g. at Tongo in 
DRC Urewe ceramics have been found in a grave  (Misago and Shumbusho 1992); in 
Kenya at Siaya Leakey et al. (1948) found Urewe vessels deliberately deposited in 
stone lined pits; and in Uganda at Lolui Island Posnansky et al. (2005) have 
identified large numbers of deliberately deposited Urewe sherds in rock crevices 
that are not associated with habitation areas. Finally, in Rwanda Van Grunderbeek et 
al. (1983) and Van Noten (1983) reported an Urewe medicine pot that was interred 
beneath an Early Iron Age iron-smelting furnace (Fig. 4.13). (These examples will be 
discussed in more detail later in this chapter in section 4.10 under socio-political 
organisation).

(reproduced from Van Noten 1983: Plate 16) 
Whilst these examples remain too thinly spread across the region to make any 
confident conclusions this anecdotal pattern does support the suggestion that 
Urewe, whilst clearly having a functional value within 1st millennium AD food 
storage, cooking and serving practices, also retained a strong symbolic association. 
Thus where this research encounters deliberately deposited Urewe ceramics it will 
focus on these contexts in order to contribute further to this discussion.   
4.5 Late Iron Age Ceramic Studies 
Ceramics and metallurgy, as in the Early Iron Age, dominate the archaeologically 
identifiable technologies of the Late Iron Age. However, roulette-decorated pottery, 
unlike Urewe, is not noted for its high quality. Instead Late Iron Age roulette-
decorated pottery is characterised by rough larger forms suggestive of a more 
utilitarian ware (Fig. 4.14). There are three main types of roulette decoration 
recognised in Great Lakes Africa: carved-wooden roulette (Fig. 4.15), twisted-string 
roulette (Fig. 4.16) and knotted-strip roulette (Fig. 4.17). However, only twisted-
string and knotted-strip roulette have been identified in Rwanda. Twisted-string 
roulette is found throughout the Late Iron Age in Rwanda, whilst knotted-strip 
roulette generally appears later in the 2nd millennium AD (approximately AD 1500 
onwards) (Nenquin 1967a; Van Noten 1983; Desmedt 1991). However, within Great 
Lakes Africa these boundaries are not clear. For example in Uganda these ceramics 
both appear at the same time (Reid 1994/5).

Late Iron Age ceramic research has followed slightly different research trajectories in 
Francophone Africa compared to Anglophone Africa and as such have received 
different classificatory names. Following A-Ware or A-Type, roulette-decorated 
ceramics have been termed B-Ware, and B-Type and C-Type (Figs. 4.18-20) 
(Hiernaux and Maquet 1960; Nenquin 1967a, 1967b; Van Noten 1983). B-Ware 
relates to both twisted-string roulette and knotted-strip roulette ceramics (e.g. see 
Nenquin 1967a), whilst Van Noten (1983) differentiated between the two calling 
twisted-string roulette-decorated ceramics B-Type and those he believed to be 
later, most commonly knotted-strip roulette ceramics, C-Type. Today, both 
twisted-string and knotted-strip rouletting continue to be applied to vessels across 
the region.

pipe-stems) from Muyaga, Rwanda (reproduced from Nenquin 1967a: 277: Fig. 162)

Musanze, Rwanda (reproduced from Van Noten 1983: Plate 44) 
Fig. 4.20 Illustration showing a C-Type knotted-strip roulette decorated vessel from Masangano 
(reproduced from Van Noten 1983: Plate 46) 
Late Iron Age roulette-decorated ceramics are generally of poorer quality than 
Urewe and are frequently made from coarse fabrics. Rims commonly consist of 
simple rounded forms and the complicated bevelling seen in Urewe is no-longer 
present. Bases may be rounded or flattened, and whilst burnishing is rare, paint or 
slip may be applied. Work at Ntusi (Reid 1994/5) showed that vessel forms are 
commonly confined to necked jars and open and hemispherical bowls whilst 
decoration is commonly applied close to or on the neck of the vessel. Unlike Urewe, 
decoration may also be applied to the interior of the vessel. 
Compared to Urewe studies, until recently there has been relatively little interest in 
roulette-decorated ceramics, other than as a dating tool and its socio-political 
significance has been ignored. This may be related to an over-emphasis on the 
importance of dating the beginning of the Iron Age through association with Urewe 
and the prevailing belief amongst archaeologists that there was little distinguishable, 
significant, variation in the Late Iron Age roulette-decorated ceramic muddle. 
However, with a growing interest in Late Iron Age socio-political development and 
the emergence of statehood, a number of detailed ceramic studies have taken place 
(e.g. Desmedt 1991; Reid 2002; Ashley 2005; McMaster 2005). Desmedt (1991: 162) 
identified various roulette types in Great Lakes Africa and by using historical lexicon 
evidence attributed these to specific ethno-linguist groups. For example, Desmedt 
called twisted-string roulette W-Group and attributed it to speakers of southern 
Nilotic languages who she suggests triggered the beginning of the Late Iron Age in 
800AD. Desmedt also attributed knotted-strip roulette (X-Group) and luxury thin 
twisted-string roulette (Y-Group) to Western-Nilotes coming from the north, which 
she suggests replaced the W-Group. Desmedt further divides her Y-Group into 
three separate regional styles specific to three different ethnic groups (Desmedt 1991: 
161-163). However, Desmedts model is unsatisfactory because she identifies ethno-
linguistic decorative types that she has failed to adequately demonstrate are 
stylistically distinct from each other. Furthermore, her ethno-linguistic migratory 
path for each group is based on tenuous site affiliation often separated by thousands 
of kilometres (Fig. 4.21). 
Fig. 4.21 Map showing Desmedts (1991) ethno-linguistic roulette-decorated ceramic migration model 
(reproduced from Desmedt 1991: 174) 
McMaster (2005) has also investigated roulette decoration and its relationship with 
language shift in the interlacustrine regions and has proposed an alternative entry 
route to Desmedt to the west of Lake Victoria (Fig. 4.22). However, in contrast to 
Desmedt (1991) she didnt rely solely upon historical lexicon evidence but also 
studied the lexicons of working artisans (McMaster 2005: 44). McMaster (2005: 61) 
also criticises Desmedt because her model attributes the introduction of roulette-
decorated ceramics to the ancestors of contemporary peoples who do not produce 
them today. Furthermore, McMaster (2005: 43), unlike Desmedt (1991), postulates 
that language shift and the spread of new ceramic types into the region by adoption, 
and not necessarily migration, may account for the replacement of Urewe ceramics 
by roulette-decorated ceramics after 800AD. McMasters study suggests based on 
historical linguistics that twisted-string roulette decoration arrived in Rwanda after 
500AD and before 1000AD. This she fits with three uncalibrated Rwandan 
radiocarbon dates associated with twisted-string roulette-decorated pottery: 730220 
at Mucucu II (Lugan 1983: 132) 74045 at Cyamakuza (Van Grunderbeek et al 1983: 
44) and Akameru 89575 (Van Noten 1983). However, as McMaster (2005: 60) points 
out the first of these has a large margin of error and the two remaining dates 
(discussed in section 4.3 of this chapter) cannot at present be the basis for a 
conclusion, because of their isolation, until further work is done on the beginning of 
the Late Iron Age.  
Fig. 4.22 Map showing the distribution of Group W Ware sites [+] in relation to Rutara and Kivu-
speakers, c.500  1000 AD. If the route of entry proposed here is correct, then the earliest evidence of 
rouletted ceramics in the Interlacustrine region should lie between Lake Rweru and Lake Kivu 
(reproduced from McMaster 2005: 62, Fig. 6) 
Reid (2002, 2004) and Ashley (2005) as part of ongoing research in Buganda, Uganda, 
have re-investigated a range of Late Iron Age ceramics including Entebbe Ware and 
have identified some new types including Sanzi Ware. However, these types appear 
to be tied to the northern shores of Lake Victoria and have not been identified 
elsewhere. Nevertheless, they have been shown to be discrete variations within the 
roulette-decorated mix. Suggesting that socially meaningful variations may exist and 
be identifiable within roulette-decorated ceramics from other regions if approached 
through similar multi-variant analysis, using a chin opratoire approach (see 
Chapter 3 section 3.9), at a site based and inter-site level. This suggestion implies a 
context for roulette-decorated ceramics as a socially embedded technology. 
However, whilst this is supported by more recent ethnoarchaeological studies of 
roulette-decorated ceramics in Great Lakes Africa (e.g. see Benjamin 2001 and Giblin 
2003 for Buganda; and Kohtamaki 2009 for Rwanda) little is known about deeper 
time periods in the 2nd millennium AD. (Although oral traditions for Buganda record 
potters who were closely related to the origin myths of the kingdom, e.g. Roscoe 
1911). For these periods archaeologists must return to the deliberate deposition of 
ceramics, as with the 1st millennium AD ceramics already discussed, and the 
occurrence of luxury ceramics alongside more utilitarian wares.  
In Rwanda the deliberate deposition of roulette-decorated ceramics is known at Ruli 
where whole pots filled with grain and legumes have been found in a grave 
containing multiple skeletons (Hiernaux and Maquet 1960; Nenquin 1967a). 
However, there is no absolute dating for the grave and the contextual data remains 
problematic (for discussion of this grave see section 4.10). Roulette-decorated 
ceramics were also found in the Rwandan royal graves excavated by Van Noten 
(1972, 1983). Although these graves were created in modern times, the grave goods 
from Cyirima Rugugiras burial are believed to date to the 17th century (see 
discussion section 4.10). Significantly these graves contain high quality roulette-
decorated ceramics that can be compared to the more frequently encountered coarse 
types that dominate 1st millennium AD ceramics in this region. Furthermore, 
Desmedt (1991: 185-190) has suggested that these luxury ceramics, her Group Y, 
appeared during the 16th century AD in Great Lakes Africa before which only the 
coarser utilitarian ware has been identified, subsequently, Vansina (2004: 18) has 
suggested that the appearance of this luxury ware may be associated with growing 
wealth in the region and the establishment of the kingdoms. Whilst this historical 
argument remains speculative without more detailed dating evidence, it is clear that 
roulette-decorated ceramics not only played a utilitarian role in the 2nd millennium 
AD but also were associated with socially and symbolically important contexts.  
Research Questions: 
The main research topics concerning Late Iron Age roulette-decorated ceramics then 
can be summarized as: 
1. When did roulette-decorated ceramics arrive in Great Lakes Africa? 
Question one is related to the archaeological hiatus discussed above (section 4.2) 
and is also of particular relevance here because some of the earliest dates from 
roulette-decorated ceramics have come from Rwanda. Thus, although this thesis has 
criticised archaeologists for searching for the origins of Urewe, clarifying the early 
dates for roulette-decorated ceramics in Rwanda will be a research objective. Unlike 
the rare early Urewe dates that cannot easily be returned to because they often come 
from fully excavated furnace bases, the early roulette dates come from partially 
excavated cave deposits, amongst other contexts, allowing for their re-investigation 
today.  
2. How did roulette-decorated ceramics appear in Great Lakes Africa? 
Question two is concerned with the origins of roulette-decorated ceramics often 
discussed in terms of the ethno-linguistic origins of its users. However, whilst this 
topic is prominent in Late Iron Age ceramic studies it doesnt conform to the 
theoretical framework developed in Chapter 3 that questions the attribution of 
ethnic status to archaeological ceramics in a Rwandan context. Moreover, whilst 
linguistic studies carried out by Desmedt (1991) and McMaster (2005) have shown 
this to be a fruitful, if contested, avenue of study, this subject is a regional question 
that is beyond the scope of this study and thus this topic will not be tackled by this 
research. 
3. Can meaningful variation be identified within roulette-decorated 
ceramics? 
Question three concerns the potential for roulette-decorated ceramics to display 
meaningful spatial or temporal variation. This subject has been demonstrated to be a 
rewarding avenue of research by recent studies and is consistent with the theoretical 
framework discussed in Chapter 3. Therefore this will be a major research objective 
and all Late Iron Age ceramics will be subjected to multi-variant ceramic analysis in 
order to tease out any potentially significant ceramic patterns. 
4. What was the social role of roulette-decorated ceramics? 
Question four is related to question three, and concerns the social and symbolic 
context of roulette-decorated ceramic production and use. Thus, where definable 
variation is observed, preferably in relation to good contextual data alongside other 
forms of archaeological evidence, this thesis will attempt to explore the immediate 
social and symbolic context of roulette-decorated ceramics as a socially imbedded 
technology with the potential to communicate social information through the 
observation of meaningful continuities and variation.  
4.6 Iron Production Studies 
Early iron production in Rwanda, Burundi and western Tanzania, has received a lot 
of attention (e.g. Van Grunderbeek et al. 1983, 2001; Van Noten 1983; Schmidt 1997; 
Craddock et al. 2007). Concentrated evidence for iron production in Early Iron Age 
Rwanda comes from Butare (Kinyarwanda meaning place of iron ore) where 
twenty furnaces were excavated (Van Grunderbeek et al. 2001: 273). The furnaces 
were mostly bowl-shaped with a conical superstructure occasionally made from 
decorated bricks (Raymaekers and Van Noten 1986; Van Grunderbeek et al. 1983). 
An Urewe pot containing white clay or kaolinite was also discovered interred under 
a furnace base suggesting a socio-symbolic element to smelting (Van Noten 1979: 65-
66). Current research by Humphris (2008) has found more evidence of Early Iron 
Age smelting in southern Rwanda at Gahondo.  
The existence of very early dates for iron working in Great Lakes Africa and West 
Africa led to suggestions of independent invention in sub-Saharan Africa (e.g. 
Trigger 1969). Based on a series of very early dates from Buhaya in Tanzania, 
Rwanda and Burundi, dating between 2700 and 4000BP, Trigger (1969) suggested 
that iron metallurgy was older in Great Lakes Africa than in Meroe, the next nearest 
early centre for iron production, dated to c.500 BC (Shinnie 1967), and thus must 
have been independently invented in Great Lakes Africa (Killick 2009: 405). In 
contrast other archaeologists such as Soper (1971: 30) considered whether iron 
technology in Great Lakes Africa had originated and spread from elsewhere. For 
example iron working was known in Nigeria in the 4-5th centuries BC (Fagg 1969) 
and in northern Ethiopia at Matara 5th century BC (Anfray 1967). Soper (1971: 31) 
also considered the possibility of iron working entering Great Lakes Africa via the 
coast. However, Soper (1971:31) rejected the coastal route due to a lack of evidence, 
rejected West Africa as unlikely and suggested that independent invention is 
exceedingly improbable. Thus, whilst Soper suggested the origin of Great Lakes 
Africa iron technology was in the north, he believed that more research was needed 
in the southern Sudan belt, between Chad and the Nile, and Ethiopia, to provide the 
necessary connections to trace the route.  
Since the beginnings of this debate many more dates have been produced (e.g. Van 
Grunderbeek et al. 2001, 2007; Schmidt and Childs 1985; Schmidt 1997) and many of 
these have fallen in the 1000 to 2000 cal BC range leading to continued suggestions of 
independent invention. However, Schmidt has now rejected the earliest of these 
dates for Buhaya (1997: 14) and Van Grunderbeek et al. (2001; also see Craddock et 
al. 2007) have distanced themselves from the 2nd millennium BC dates for Rwanda 
and Burundi. Thus, iron metallurgy is now believed to have appeared in western 
Great Lakes Africa at some point during the 1st millennium BC. However, it is 
difficult to be more precise because these dates fall within a black hole in the 
radiocarbon curve resulting in the calibrated dates (2 sigma) all being give a date 
range of between 800-400 cal BC exactly the period in which the earliest iron 
working evidence exist at Meroe (Killick 2009: 406). Thus, in the absence of furnace 
remains and other iron production waste at Meroe, that could aid typological 
comparison, it is unlikely that this debate will be resolved soon. 
Following the rejection of the early dates for the western Great Lakes Africa region 
Killick (2004) has explored other locations in sub-Saharan Africa where iron 
metallurgy may have been independently invented. Killick (2004: 103-104) found 
that the case for the independent invention of iron working now hinges on the 
evidence from Niger at sites such as Termit (e.g. Paris et al. 1992 cited in Killick 
2004). However, Killick (2004: 104) questions the association between the 
radiocarbon dates and the iron samples, the absence of iron production remains at 
these sites and the lack of radiocarbon evidence for iron working before 2500BP at 
neighbouring sites, and highlights the potential for contamination by old wood. In 
conclusion Killick (2004: 104) suggests that there is no proof that iron was 
independently invented in Niger or anywhere in sub-Saharan Africa but nor is there 
any evidence to suggest that it was introduced from elsewhere. Thus the ultimate 
origin of iron technology in Great Lakes Africa and Rwanda remains illusive and 
this is unlikely to change unless detailed ceramic typologies can be developed 
supported by secure stratigraphic preservation (Killick 2004: 107). 
The appearance of roulette-decorated ceramics at the end of the 1st millennium AD, 
suggested by Van Noten (1983) and Van Grunderbeek (1982) (see discussion section 
4.1) in Rwanda has been associated with the identification of a new type of iron 
furnace and a dramatic rise in the occurrence of iron production waste suggesting an 
increase in production (Van Noten 1983: 34-35, 62). However, despite the importance 
of iron production as a dominant social facet during the Kingdom Era, research 
attention in Rwanda has continued to focus on the origins of iron metallurgy at the 
beginning of the Early Iron Age at the expense of its development throughout the 
following 2500 years. This situation is soon to be improved by Jane Humphris (2008) 
continuing work in Rwanda that is specifically targeting later furnace remains 
amongst other issues. Thus, archaeometallurgical studies will not be attempted here.  
4.7 Palaeo-Environment  
Palaeoenvironmental evidence for Great Lakes Africa and Rwanda comes from fossil 
pollen (palynology), the biochemical analysis of lake sediments and tracing changes 
in the volume of river systems (Paleohydrology) (Taylor and Marchant 1994/5: 283-
295). The pollen record for this region is good, with a series of cores having been 
taken from Burundi, Rwanda and western Uganda. One pollen core taken from 
Rwandas Kamiranzovu Swamp dates to at least 40,000 BP (Hamilton 1982: 182-3; 
Jolly et al. 1997; Schoenbrun 1998: 30). However, this particular core is not of use for 
periods after the last Glacial. For these later Holocene environments, evidence comes 
from cores taken in southwest Uganda and central Burundi (e.g. Taylor and 
Marchant 1994/5; Taylor et al. 1999, 2000; Jolly et al 1997: 508).  
This pollen data has been used to track the ebb and flow of grasslands and forests 
and has shown that there was a shift to a drier form of forest around 3250 BP in 
central Africa around Rwanda, Burundi and western Uganda (Jolly et al. 1997: 508). 
The next major change in distribution began around 2500 BP with a dramatic 
reduction in forest size and the appearance of degraded and disturbed soils. Due to 
the speed of deforestation and correlation with archaeological events such as the 
beginnings of farming and metalworking it has been attributed to human clearance 
(Jolly et al. 1997; Taylor et al. 1999). A variety of causes for this clearance have been 
suggested such as increasing agricultural pressures for land, metallurgical demands 
for fuel and pastoral concerns regarding parasitic cattle diseases (Van Grunderbeek 
et al. 1983; Schoenbrun 1998: 32, 75; Taylor et al. 1999).  
The early forest clearers appear to have had an initial preference for high altitude 
environments that Jolly et al. (1997: 511) suggest were preferential because they 
would have had a lower density of trees, more easily cultivatable soils and a lower 
incidence of disease. In Rwanda Van Grunderbeek et al. (1983: 8) have used pollen 
data and fossil wood to produce a map of Rwandas vegetation zones around 2000 
BP. Van Grundebeek et al. (1983: 9) suggest that Rwandas Early Iron Age vegetation 
ranged from low wooded savannah in the east to high montane forest at the bottom 
of the Virunga volcanic chain in the north and west and that whilst vegetation 
diversity remained stable, the distribution of this vegetation did not. However, more 
recent palaeoecological evidence produced in neighbouring south west Uganda, at 
Kigezi Swamp in the Rukiga Highlands, has found that a decrease in taxa began 
around c.2200 BP (Taylor and Merchant 1994/5).  
Jolly et al. (1997) suggest that the next major phase of deforestation in central Africa, 
including Rwanda, occurred around AD 1000. This event, assumed to be the result 
of human activity, coincided with a climatic shift that created drier conditions, the 
development of specialised pastoralism, an increase in iron production, a shift in site 
distribution and an increase in soil degradation (Jolly et al. 1997: 511). It has been 
hypothesised that farming activities, alongside forest clearance for fuel for 
metallurgists and land for grazing, led to soil degradation forcing communities to 
adopt new subsistence activities such as specialised pastoralism. The drier 
conditions and versatility of specialised pastoralism may have encouraged 
communities to experiment and expand into new environments such as the 
grasslands (Schoenbrun 1998: 100). However, it is also possible that a series of 
economic specialisations were developing at this time, not as a result of degradation, 
but as a result of internal political change (Reid 1996, 2004).  
Evidence of this drier phase comes from palynology and oral traditions alongside 
climatic evidence from the Rodah Nilometer, which suggest that there were two dry 
periods in Great Lakes Africa, AD 950 to AD 1100 and 1200 AD to 1450, that created 
environmental uncertainty for Late Iron Age communities (Schoenbrun 1998: 230). 
This dry phase fits with oral traditions that record a drought in the region around 
this period. However, archaeological and linguistic results suggest that this was not 
the great drought believed by some, such as Tantala (1989 cited in Schoenbrun 
1998: 231), who have taken a literal reading of the oral sources, but was actually a 
period of gradual change with a variety of responses (Schoenbrun 1998: 231; Reid 
1991; Robertshaw 1999). The dominance of the drought or dry phase theory must 
also be questioned as there would have been different consequences, negative and 
positive, for both drier and wetter phases on the many different ecosystems of Great 
Lakes Africa and also we cannot reduce radiocarbon variation neatly into a single 
climatic phase (Reid 1991).  
4.8 Site Location 
Having summarized the palaeo-environmental data for Rwanda and Great Lakes 
Africa it is now important to discuss how this relates to site-location in Rwanda and 
neighbouring areas. Unfortunately, in the absence of any systematic survey in 
Rwanda the available pattern of site distribution relies upon scattered clusters of 
sites that are clearly unrepresentative for much of the country. For example much of 
the evidence for the Early Iron Age distribution comes from the area around Butare 
in the south that has seen concerted efforts in archaeometallurgical research (Fig. 
4.23).  
Fig. 4.23 Map showing location of Early Iron Age sites in Rwanda 
The available site location evidence suggests that a broadly similar settlement 
pattern occurred in Rwanda and neighbouring lands during the Early Iron Age. For 
example, in southern Uganda, Maclean (1994/5, 1996a,b) only recovered Urewe 
ceramics within low lying, densely vegetated regions with good agricultural soils in 
rainforest conditions. This is supported by negative evidence from systematic 
surveys in western Uganda and Tanzania, which suggests that Urewe using 
populations did not exploit the drier low-lying grasslands (Reid 1990, 1991; Reid and 
Njau 1994; Robertshaw1994). Comparatively, in the Central Highlands of Rwanda, 
open sites are only found in forested low montane environments that represent some 
of the most fertile land in that region (Van Grunderbeek 1982; Van Grunderbeek et 
al. 1983, 2001; Van Noten 1979, 1983). However, Early Iron Age Urewe users did not 
only occupy open sites but also exploited caves in Rwanda (see Boutakoff 1937 and 
Nenquin 1967a) and in Uganda at Nsongezi Rockshelter (Pearce and Posnansky 
1963).  
The open site pattern shows a selection preference for well-watered, riverine or 
lacustrine environments, although, Schmidts (1997: 412) work in Buhaya, where he 
found sites located 2km from the nearest water source, demonstrates that sites need 
not have immediate access to water and could also be situated in the hinterland (Fig. 
4.24). Nevertheless the data suggests that similar site location concerns occupied the 
Early Iron Age inhabitants of this region. Supporting the suggestion that Early Iron 
Age Urewe users practised a common subsistence strategy. Indicated by their 
preference for good agricultural soils (Reid 1994/5: 307; Van Grunderbeek et al. 
2001: 275). However, the selection of site location was not necessarily stable in the 
Early Iron Age. For example, Schmidt (1997: 401) records a shift away from the 
ridges utilised during early settlement in Buhaya towards the more fertile Lake 
Ikimba region to the west following an onset of more arid condition in the 1st 
millennium AD.  
During the Late Iron Age there was a dramatic shift in site selection. Systematic 
surveys in southern Uganda suggest that in the 2nd millennium AD people were 
abandoning their well-watered grounds and were moving into drier grassland 
environments that were previously uninhabited (Reid 1990; Robertshaw 1994; 
Schoenbrun 1998: 16). However, this does not appear to have been the case in 
Rwanda (Fig 4.21). Whilst it is true that site distribution during the Late Iron Age 
was spread over a wider set of environmental niches including the drier grasslands 
(although Lugans 1983 survey of the present day Akageru National Park, a 
grassland environment produced very few Iron Age results), there is also no 
abandonment of the earlier well-watered low montane environs (Nenquin 1967a: 
258, 273, 284). Unfortunately, as for the Early Iron Age, the current site distribution 
for the Late Iron Age in Rwanda may not be representative. Currently, many more 
Early Iron Age sites have been recorded and excavated despite an increase in 
population size that is believed to have taken place during the Late Iron Age. For 
example, Vansina (2004: 128-129) suggests that the population within and outside of 
the Nyiginya Kingdom continued to grow considerably during the 18th and 19th 
centuries due to increased success in farming and the related benefits that it brought.  
Unfortunately, despite the value of an environmental approach to the Iron Age, an 
investigation into the palaeo-environment of Rwanda and the region is beyond the 
scope of this research project because it would require facilities, experience and a 
timeframe not catered for here. Furthermore, the palaeo-environment of western 
Great Lakes Africa is relatively well known compared to elsewhere. Therefore this 
research will not be focusing on palaeo-enviromental investigation but will use this 
model as a framework through which other aspects of Iron Age life can be better 
understood. However, site location is an accessible and relevant topic for this 
research. In the absence of any systematic survey in Rwanda the current site location 
patterning is potentially biased in favour of intensively investigated easily accessible 
locations close to administrative centres. Therefore, through the implementation of a 
programme of systematic survey, this research will explore settlement patterning in 
the Iron Age, a process that will also aid the identification of suitable archaeological 
resources for the exploration of other research objectives.  
4.9 Subsistence  
In terms of subsistence, the appearance of agriculture and herding are generally 
presumed to mark the transition from the Late Stone Age to the Early Iron Age in 
Great Lakes Africa. However, hunter-gatherer-fisher economies were not totally 
replaced by farming and have endured into modern times. The beginning of farming 
in Great Lakes Africa, as with most developments in the 1st millennium BC, has been 
associated with the arrival of the Bantu language group (e.g. Oliver 1966). However, 
the farming element of the Bantu Package model continues to be questioned by 
more nuanced studies of Late Stone Age to Early Iron Age archaeology that 
demonstrate continuity between these periods (e.g. Lane et al. 2007). Yet, despite 
sustained levels of interest in Great Lakes Africa Early Iron Age subsistence, 
relatively little tangible evidence is available. This is due in part to poor preservation 
conditions for archaeological flora and fauna (Young and Thompson 1999; Marshall 
2000).  
The only direct evidence for the cultivation of domestic crops in Early Iron Age 
Rwanda comes from sorghum and finger millet pollen found at Kabuye in Butare 
(Van Grunderbeek et al 1983: 42). However, this evidence has been brought into 
question due to potential contamination and the small size of the sample (Maclean 
1996a: 47; Reid, 1994/5: 305) and despite its defence (Van Grunderbeek 2001: 271; 
Van Grundebeek and Roche 2005) it remains problematic without further supporting 
evidence. Indirect evidence for cultivation during the Early Iron Age comes from site 
distribution and the selection of good agricultural soils (see discussion above section 
4.8). Linguistic studies suggest that root cropping was already known by proto-
Bantu speakers and that Early Iron Age Bantu speakers, reliant on forest crops such 
as yams, would have been introduced to sorghum, millet and bean crops through 
contact with other language groups (Schoenbrun 1993, 1994/5, 1998: 110).  
Direct evidence of animal husbandry in Early Iron Age Rwanda comes from only 
two sites, Kabuye and Remera, where cattle teeth have been found (Van 
Grunderbeek 1981; Van Grunderbeek et al. 2001: 273-275). Although the 
identification of these teeth and their association with the archaeology has been 
questioned (Reid 1994/5), the sparse archaeological evidence has again been 
supported by linguistic data that suggests Bantu speakers, who occupied this region 
at this time, had a limited knowledge of stock keeping during the Early Iron Age 
(Ehret 1998: 133; Schoenbrun 1993: 19-20).  
The presence of hunter-gatherer-fisher subsistence during the Early Iron Age in 
Rwanda has been taken for granted and thus overlooked in favour of the appearance 
of new modes of subsistence such as herding and cultivation. This has been 
compounded by poor region wide preservation conditions (Marshall 2000). Indirect 
evidence for the exploitation of wild animals in Early Iron Age Rwanda comes from 
locations such as rock-shelters and caves (e.g. Ruhimangyargya, Mukinanira and 
Kamboza) (Van Noten 1983). However, linguistic evidence again allows for a richer 
appreciation of foraging in the Early Iron Age. Schoenbrun (1998: 24) has found 
evidence that foragers were exploiting forests to collect medicine in the form of 
leaves, roots and bark, lumber, wild game and plants (yams, tubers, fruits, seeds and 
edible leaves) and insect foods and they used spears, bows and arrows, and net and 
pit traps to catch animals for their protein and skins (Schoenbrun 1998: 24). 
Linguistic evidence for foraging suggests that there was a complicated process of 
regional specialisation with local settlement preferences and that the history of 
hunter-gatherers, was not just a shapeless mass of peoples comings and goings 
helpless before the vagaries of the environment.  (Schoenbrun 1998: 67)  
During the Late Iron Age specialised pastoralism and agriculture appeared in Great 
Lakes Africa. However, archaeological understanding of Late Iron Age subsistence 
in Rwanda is extremely limited and popular 20th century presentations owe more to 
ethnographic analogy and disputed oral histories than tangible evidence (discussed 
in Chapter 2 section 2.4) Archaeologically, much more is known about farming 
economies from neighbouring countries. For example, early in the second 
millennium AD grassland sites such as Ntusi appeared in southern Uganda. These 
sites are characterised by a strong pastoral element alongside agricultural remains. 
At Ntusi 80-90% of all faunal remains were cattle (Reid 1996: 623) and these were 
found alongside indirect evidence for agriculture that included grindstones, ceramic 
abrasion patterns (Reid and Young 2000), grain harvesting knives and deep storage 
pits (Reid 1991).  
Evidence of foraging from the beginning of the Late Iron Age in Rwanda comes from 
two Musanze caves in northern Rwanda, Cyinkomane and Akameru (Van Noten 
1983: 34-35; Gautier 1983: 104-120). Evidence from these caves show that whilst the 
occupants were exploiting wild animal resources in the local environment they also 
had access to resources associated with farming, such as domestic stock, including 
chickens, cattle, sheep and goats (Gautier 1983: 118) and roulette-decorated ceramics 
(Van Noten 1983: 34-25). These remains can be compared and contrasted with the 
faunal remains from the Iron Age deposits at Matupi Cave, in north-eastern DRC 
(Fig. 4.24) (Van Neer 1984). Matupi cave is comparable because during the Iron Age 
it was located in equatorial forest, a similar environment in which the Musanze 
caves would have been situated until recently (although the Musanze caves were 
located close to the periphery of the equatorial rainforest environment through 
much of the Late Iron Age) (Vansina 2004: 50, 124, 153, 178, 179). At Matupi, Van 
Noten (1977) excavated a Late Iron Age deposit, dated to c.1200 AD, overlying a Late 
Stone Age deposit. The faunal remains from both deposits consisted entirely of wild 
remains with no evidence of domestic species present (Van Neer 1984: 62). These 
examples demonstrate that the populations living within the equatorial rainforest 
during the Late Iron Age cannot be assumed to fit a single homogenous mode of 
subsistence but need to be approached and appreciated through locally scaled 
studies.  
Fig. 4.24 Satellite image showing location of Matupi Cave , DRC 
Further subsistence evidence from the Late Iron Age in Rwanda comes from the 18th 
century Ndorwa kingdom capital site, Ryamurari. At Ryamurari Tshihiluka (1983: 
153) found direct evidence of the consumption of pastoral products through the 
identification of cattle bones, and indirect evidence of the consumption of 
agricultural products through the identification of grain grinding stones. However, 
no wild remains, with the exception of rabbit bones, were identified. Whilst the 
pastoral evidence fits with the oral traditions that record Ndorwa as a kingdom built 
on cattle wealth it makes a contribution by demonstrating that agricultural produce 
was also present at the heart of the kingdom.  
Fig. 4.25 Map showing location of Ryamurari and Musanze Caves in northern Rwanda 
This summary has highlighted the need for more work on subsistence practices in 
Rwanda during the Iron Age because currently the evidence is confined to isolated 
finds and assumptions based on linguistics, site location and migration models. 
Whilst more evidence exists for subsistence during the Late Iron Age this is confined 
to two sites, the Musanze Caves and Ryamurari (Fig. 4.25). Nothing is known of 
open non-capital sites and the cave evidence raises more questions than it answers. 
For example, what explanations can be given for the occurrence of a mixed wild and 
domesticated faunal assemblage at Cyinkomane and Akameru? Gautier (1983: 118) 
suggests the cave occupants were pastoralists who used these locations as refuges 
utilising wild species whilst they were there. However, this argument is solely based 
on the percentage of wild to domestic species in two small test-excavation units, and 
thus remains speculative.  
Subsistence orientation during the Late Iron Age in Rwanda is also of considerable 
recent political relevance because much has been assumed about the relationship 
between ethnicity and subsistence (see Chapters 2 and 3). Therefore Rwandan Iron 
Age subsistence will be selected as a major research theme in this study. This thesis 
will seek to make an empirical contribution to subsistence studies through the 
identification and dating of subsistence remains. Furthermore, it will directly target 
archaeological deposits in the Musanze Caves to develop understanding of the 
relationship between farmers and foragers during the Iron Age.  
Based on this discussion and the historical and theoretical frameworks set out in 
Chapters 2 and 3, it will ask specifically:  
1. What evidence is there for an economic subsistence trichotomy between forager, 
agriculturalist and pastoralist in the Rwandan Iron Age?  
And where this null hypothesis is not supported: 
2. What was the nature of forager-farmer relations in the Rwandan Iron Age? 
Whilst the relationship between farming and foraging communities has not been 
explored previously in Rwanda, it has been elsewhere in Great Lakes Africa and 
most notably in Southern Africa. Therefore, because this will become a major 
research focus in this thesis examples from these two regions will be briefly 
reviewed here. 
Forager-Farmer Relations in Great Lakes Africa 
Lane et al. (2007) have explored the transition from Late Stone Age hunter-gatherer 
subsistence to Iron Age farming at two sites on the eastern edge of Lake Victoria in 
Kenya, Wadh Lango and Usenge 3. They questioned the assumption that where 
Bantu-speaking farmers encountered hunter-gatherer lifestyles they replaced these 
and instead suggest that long-term interactions with regional variations took place 
between 1500BC and AD500. At Wadh Lango in Western Kenya a series of Stone 
Age, Pastoral Neolithic (approximately 3300 to 1300 BP for Elmenteitan ceramics), 
Iron Age and Historic, archaeological deposits containing ceramic faunal material 
were encountered. Lane et al. (2007: 70) found mixed wild/domesticate faunal 
assemblages containing sheep or goats (Ovis/Capra) within the Late Stone Age, 
Pastoral Neolithic and Iron Age deposits. Whilst the percentage of domesticates to 
wild species decreased during the Iron Age, based on body part representation and 
age profiles, Lane et al. (2007: 70) suggest there is some continuity in herd 
management. However, nearby at Usenge 3 faunal assemblages were almost entirely 
dominated by hunted and fished remains, although rare sheep/goat remains were 
identified in both the Late Stone Age (Kansyore) and Early Iron Age deposits and 
cattle were present in the Early Iron Age deposits (Lane et al. 2007: 74). Lane et al 
(2007: 75) concluded that the Usenge 3 faunal assemblage was created by specialised 
hunters and was not made by a society primarily involved in farming. The ceramic 
assemblage also suggested that this was primarily a hunting community. Whilst the 
Iron Age ceramics from Usenge 3 were comparable with and contemporary to 
Classic Urewe, they were subtly different and were termed Contact Urewe 
(described in section 4.4, Fig. 4.7 this chapter).  
Forager-Farmer Relations in Southern Africa 
In Southern Africa the appearance of farming in the early first millennium AD has 
also been associated with the arrival of the Bantu Package (Oliver 1966). In this 
region the first farmers combined cereal grain agriculture and stock keeping. They 
grew a range of crops including grains such as Pearl millet (Pennisetum americanum), 
finger millet (Eleusine coracana) and Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and pulses including 
Bambara groundnuts, (Voandzeia subterranea) and cowpeas, (Vigna sinensis) (Maggs 
and Ward 1984; Huffman 1974 cited by Mitchell 2002: 275). Domestic animal species 
exploited include cattle, sheep and goats (e.g. Plug 1979: 123; Plug and Engela 1992:  
19; Sadr and Plug 2001: 1, 4, 8). Wild remains are also found but their relationship 
with the farming communities is not always clear. Whilst farmers may have taken 
part in hunting directly they may also have received their meat indirectly through 
trade with hunter-gatherers (Mitchell 2002: 275-276). Hunter-gatherers did not 
disappear at the end of the Late Stone Age but persisted into and throughout the 
Iron Age. Thus as Mitchell (2002: 292) points out farming did not expand into a 
vacuum but would have had to co-exist and develop alongside foraging (e.g. Thorp 
1996: 57-63). Maggs (1980: 11) suggests that in the Thukela Basin farmers produced 
metal to trade with hunter-gatherers whilst flaked stone tools, bone points and 
ostrich eggshell beads at farming sites may represent materials moving in the 
opposite direction. Mazel (1989b: 4-7) suggests that these finds are only a few 
elements of a much larger mutually supportive, integrated exchange system. Other 
studies have focused on the possibility of how contact with farmers may have 
affected hunter-gatherer populations and changed social dynamics for example in 
gender roles and production through inter-marriage and exchange ties (Mazel 1989a 
Wadley 1996: 1-2, 11).  
The Kalahari Debate 
A relevant case study for this research from Southern Africa is the Kalahari Debate 
(e.g. Reid 2005). A stereotypical view of Kalahari populations continues to be 
presented in popular culture and to some extent in academia. This stereotype 
suggests that these populations have lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle unchanged in 
the Kalahari for thousands of years and therefore present a pristine image of Stone 
Age society. However, this stereotype is based on assumptions about the 
archaeological past but without archaeological evidence to support them (Reid 2005: 
353).  
This stereotype has been challenged by the Revisionist School (e.g. Wilmsen and 
Debow 1990) who, through their analysis of the Kalahari populations political 
economy, suggested that hunter-gatherer societies were not isolated by absence of 
contact but were marginalized by political processes taking place in the broader 
region over many centuries. This theory was in opposition to the established 
stereotyped view and arguments between the two positions were termed the 
Kalahari Debate (e.g. Lee and Guenther 1991; Solway and Lee 1990; Wilmsen 1993; 
Wilmsen and Denbow 1990). The Revisionist School undermined the use of the 
Kalahari peoples in comparative anthropology and social evolutionary studies by 
emphasising the need to investigate the historical perspectives of these populations 
(Wilmsen 1989). For example, archaeological research has shown that the margins of 
the Kalahari have been populated for a long time. Denbow (1984) documented 
hundreds of Toutswe and other sites with a pastoral element on the eastern edge of 
the Kalahari dating to between AD 900 and 1300 suggesting that there was a high 
potential for contact between the Kalahari hunter-gatherer populations and other 
subsistence systems. However, critics of the Revisionist School (e.g. Kent 1998: 16) 
suggest that the identification of a few exotic items does not mean the Kalahari 
societies had forsaken their own ways of life and been dominated by a farmer 
society. Furthermore, critics suggested that the revisionist model merely replaced the 
isolationist model with an encapsulation model and failed to investigate potential 
complex interactions between these communities and the choice of hunters to 
remain hunters. For example, Smith and Lee (1997) identified communities 
apparently untouched by agricultural production, suggesting that a variety of 
different experiences could be recognised.  
Another criticism of the Revisionist school is that it ignores actively negotiated 
interactions between the Kalahari populations and the margins over the past 2000 
years that archaeologists such as (Reid 2005: 364) suggest are likely to have 
happened. For example, Reid and Segobye (2000), through an archaeological and 
oral historical study in the Mosu area of Botswana, found evidence of farming 
communities living in close proximity to hunter-gatherer communities and teaching 
them farming and livestock-keeping, in exchange for knowledge of the local 
environment. Reid also found that whilst hunter-gather populations could shift to 
farming, it was also possible for farming populations to shift to a hunter-gatherer 
subsistence economy (Reid 2005: 366).  
These examples serve to demonstrate that the adoption of farming and the 
relationship between farmers and hunter-gatherer communities was not a simple 
one. As Lane et al. (2007: 78) suggests the transition to farming could be a complex, 
fluctuating and perhaps incomplete, process. There is no universal model, instead 
subsistence relations need to be understood as historically situated localised 
phenomena and thus no universal homogenous model exists, further supporting an 
archaeological investigation of subsistence in the Rwandan Iron Age instead of 
relying on simplistic ethnographic analogies. 
4.10 Social Organisation 
The archaeological evidence for socio-political organisation in Great Lakes Africa 
during the Early Iron Age is very sparse. Evidence of domestic space in Rwanda 
comes from one site, Mirama II, where Van Grunderbeek (1981) found a moulded 
mud hearth. Potential evidence for individual houses from the wider region comes 
from only three other sites: in southern Uganda (Maclean 1996a: 71), northwest 
Tanzania (Schmidt and Childs 1985: 65) and in eastern Democratic Republic of 
Congo (Van Noten 1979: 69). However, this evidence is not conclusive and thus it is 
impossible at this stage to talk of the Urewe house or Urewe settlement (Reid 
1994/5: 304).   
Despite the paucity of evidence Van Grunderbeek et al. (1983: 43-44) have proposed 
a model of socio-political organisation for Early Iron Age Rwanda based on 
palaeoenvironmental and site location data. They suggest communities were 
dispersed, separated by marshes and rivers that snaked between the hills of the low 
montane environment and that these communities were made up of individuals 
engaged in subsistence activities alongside metallurgy, pottery and charcoal 
production. Whilst this is a useful summary of the available evidence it does not take 
us beyond a description of the extant empirical evidence. Schmidt (1997: 400, 403, 
411, 417-418) has proposed a more ambitious complex model of socio-political 
organisation for northwest Tanzania. Schmidt suggests that increasing complexity in 
iron technology led to increasing social complexity and describes how Urewe users 
with low-density incipient metallurgical skills occupied dispersed settlements until 
c.200 AD. During the following 200 years he suggests that social groups 
consolidated, stimulating the development of social ranking based on access to 
technological resources. Finally, beyond this time, Schmidt (1997: 401) suggests that 
standardised technological production at factory sites occurred leading to social 
centralisation and emergent complexity. Clearly then, Schmidts (1997) and Van 
Grunderbeek et al.s (1983) model differ considerably and are not without their 
problems. For example (Reid 1994/5: 306) has suggested that iron furnace remains 
are not necessarily evidence of continued concentrated activity but may be the 
remains of single use furnaces, which, if that were the case, would reduce the 
evidence for technological intensification that Schmidt proposes. However, Urewe is 
a region wide phenomenon and it is entirely possible, and indeed likely, that a range 
of socio-political structures existed in the 1st millennium AD. Thus, promoting the 
potential for variability and difference during this period and warning against the 
imposition of generalised, homogenising models. 
Whilst the Early Iron Age has been characterised as a period consisting of various 
groups of homogenous small scale farming communities, during the Late Iron Age a 
processes of fragmentation took place that saw the rise of various states and 
kingdoms in the 16th and 17th century. Direct socio-political evidence from the 
beginning of the Late Iron Age in Rwanda has not yet been identified. Thus, 
evidence has been sought from more intensively investigated neighbouring regions. 
For example, early 2nd millennium AD grassland sites such as Ntusi and Munsa from 
Uganda present a picture of growing centralised authority and organisation 
supported by a new agro-pastoral economy (Reid 1991; Robertshaw 1997). These 
sites went into decline around the 15th century (Reid 1996) and were followed by 
sites such as Bigo with major earthworks implying even greater levels of social 
cohesion than previously seen (Sutton 1998).  
By the beginning of the 18th century these grassland sites, but not the region, had 
been abandoned and new political formations were developing into the Late Iron 
Age kingdoms of the Great Lakes such as Rwanda (the Nyginya Kingdom), 
Buganda, Bunyoro, Karagwe, Nkore and Ndorwa (Vansina 2004: 111). Yet, despite 
detailed historical knowledge from the oral traditions that identify the location of 
many of the capital sites, due both to their impermanence and to subsequent 
agricultural disturbance, few remains can be found. One exception is Ryamurari 
(Fig. 4.25), an eighteenth century capital of Ndorwa, a cattle and grain producing 
state in the north east of Rwanda, where some preserved archaeological features 
remain (Tshihiluka 1983: 152) (already discussed in section 4.9). At Ryamurari 
Tshihiluka identified eighteen enclosures associated with large cattle kraals and 
domestic spaces. There was considerable labour investment at Ryamurari attested by 
the presence of large earthworks, 1.5-2.5m high, around some of the kraals and by 
the large deep-water collection features carved into the granite outcrops (Tshihiluka 
1983: 149). The organisation necessary to produce these works and the 
disproportionate investment of labour at some of the enclosures suggests a 
centralised authority existed with clear power inequalities within society, as would 
be expected at a kingdom capital site. However, whilst Ryamurari is an important 
example of a Great Lakes Africa capital site it is unrepresentative for the majority of 
Rwanda at this time that was not ruled by Ndorwa but instead by the Nyiginya 
Dynasty.  
Burials 
Burials are a potential window into Iron Age society because they represent 
deliberate deposition of human remains often alongside grave goods. This culturally 
significant act and its associated artefacts can be used to infer the concerns of the 
living populations who deposited them. However, no Early Iron Age graves have 
been identified in Rwanda and the only Urewe burial excavated so far in the western 
Lakes region is in Tongo, northern Kivu, DRC (Fig. 4.27) (Misago and Shumbusho 
1992: 70). The Tongo burial one complete child skeleton lying above an adult 
skeleton, which was wearing two iron rings and was lying alongside Urewe 
ceramics in a cavity cut into natural limestone. Unfortunately, this site was only 
identified after it had been badly damaged by road works and has only been dated 
by its association with Urewe ceramics, no radiocarbon dates have been taken and it 
has only briefly been published. Sixty other skeletons were encountered and goods 
identified including: whole pots, iron rings, shell pearls and animal tooth pendants. 
However these were all uncovered during the road works and were not 
archaeologically excavated (Misago and Shumbusho 1992: 70).  
Fig. 4.26 Map showing location of Tongo and other archaeological sites in eastern DRC (reproduced 
from Misago and Shumbusho 1992: 69,Fig. 2) 
Later burials are known from neighbouring areas such as the necropolis at Sanga in 
the Upemba depression in southeast DRC (Fig. 4.27), excavated for the first time by 
Nenquin (1963), and subsequently by Hiernaux (1971) and de Maret (1977). At Sanga 
a series of graves (e.g. Fig. 4.28) were excavated and found to have dates ranging 
from the 8th century to the 15th century AD (de Maret et al. 1977: 488). These graves 
contained both adult and child skeletons and were associated with Kisalian and 
Kabambian ceramics amongst other finds, that have similarities with Urewe but are 
more closely related to ceramics to the south in Zambia (discussed in more detail in 
Chapter 9 section 9. 10).

Fig. 4.28 Photograph showing Classic Kisalian grave, 172, from Sanga (reproduced from de Maret 1977: 
Plate 1) 
Late Iron Age burials have been identified in Rwanda. For example at Ruli a 
collective grave containing B-Ware ceramics was excavated (Hiernaux and Maquet 
1960; Nenquin 1967a: 278). Other tentative evidence regarding socio-political 
organisation in Late Iron Age Rwanda comes from the royal graves of Cyirima 
Rujugira, Kigeri Rwabugiri and Reine-mere Nyirayuhi Kanjogera excavated by Van 
Noten (1972, 1983). Whilst the latter represent the graves of late 19th  early 20th 
century rulers Cyirimas grave has relevance with much earlier times, revealing Late 
Iron Age socio-political concerns. Cyirima died in the 17th century but he was not 
buried due to traditional laws regarding succession that were unfulfilled because the 
following king dieing too early for them to be completed. Thus Cyirimas body, and 
all the grave goods that were to be buried with him, were kept in a royal hut until 
the early 20th century when the colonial administration decided to bury him in 1931. 
Cyirima was buried with all of his 17th century burial offerings but was excavated by 
Van Noten in 1969 under the post-independent government, which was less 
sympathetic to the previous ruling dynasty. Van Notens (1972, 1983) excavations 
revealed a wealth of grave goods including ceramics, iron objects and worked bone 
ornaments (Fig. 4.29). Of significance here is the presence of objects associated with 
hunting, pastoralism, agriculture and metal work, including projectile points, such 
as arrow and spear heads, hoe blades, billhooks and hammer anvils. Whilst the 
arrangement of the goods may be questioned as they were interred in the 20th 
century, elements of the composition of the assemblage are believed to be 17th 
century based on radiocarbon dates (de Maret 1977). These goods suggest that the 
Nyiginya Kingdom in Rwanda at this period was founded on a range of economic 
activities, which the ruling dynasty stressed through physical association with 
symbolically important items within the royal grave.  
Fig. 4.29. Illustration showing grave plan of Cyirima Rujugira (reproduced from Van Noten 1983: Plate 
Clearly our understanding of socio-political organisation in Rwanda during much of 
the Iron Age is inadequate and where we have detail, such as for the Kingdom Era 
this evidence comes largely from oral traditions, which are problematic sources of 
evidence in this context (for a detailed discussion of these problems see Chapter 2 
sections 2.3). Therefore this subject has been identified as a prime research concern 
and where identified evidence such as settlement layouts, living floors and burials, 
these will be a focus of this thesis. 
4.11 Research Questions Compiled 
This chapter has summarized the central themes in Great Lakes Africa Iron Age 
studies with specific focus on Rwanda. Through this discussion a series of pertinent 
and practical research themes, and related research questions, have been identified 
including:  
Dating: 
 What was happening in Rwanda between AD 800 and 1100?  
Ceramics:  
 Is Urewe in Rwanda a homogenous ceramic type or can socially meaningful 
variation be identified within it?  
 What happened to Urewe at the end of the Early Iron Age? 
 Are the very early dates for roulette-decorated ceramics in Rwanda 
supported by new research? 
    Can socially meaningful variation be identified within Rwandan roulette-
decorated ceramics? 
Site Location 
 Is the current settlement model in Rwanda for the Early and Late Iron Age 
supported by systematic survey? 
 Is there a shift in site location preference between the Early Iron Age and the 
Late Iron Age? 
Subsistence: 
 What evidence is there for an economic trichotomy between forager, 
agriculturalist and pastoralist in the Rwandan Iron Age?  
And where this null hypothesis is not supported: 
 What can we say archaeologically about foragerfarmer relations in the 
Rwandan Iron Age? 
The following chapter (5) presents an appropriate methodology through which these 
themes and questions have been addressed archaeologically.  
Chapter Five 
Methodology 
The research questions identified in Chapter 4 will be tackled through the 
identification, analysis and interpretation of three overlapping core archaeological 
data sets: site distribution, archaeological ceramics and subsistence remains.  
It is important here to re-iterate the key aims of this research that relate to the 
development of an effective methodology:   
- To identify new archaeological resources  
- To collect archaeological samples from these and extant resources 
- To examine continuity and variation within these archaeological resources 
- To compare regional archaeological patterns 
- To explore non-ethno-racial pasts within the generated data 
The success of this methodology will be constrained by the availability, preservation, 
ease of collection, and interpretative potential of the identified archaeological 
resources within the time limit of a PhD framework.  
5.1 Designing a Methodology  
It was necessary to respond to the aims and concerns set out above by developing an 
integrated methodological approach that followed key design criteria outlined 
below:  
Pragmatism: A methodology was required that could deal with the collection and 
processing of data in a sensible and realistic way that was based on practicality 
alongside theoretical ideals. There has been little or no archaeological research in 
Rwanda for the past twenty years and the country is still undergoing reconstruction 
following the genocide and civil war. Furthermore, this research was undertaken in 
locales where the extant archaeological resources were unknown, and this research 
had to be conducted within the time limitations of a PhD framework.  
Maximisation: Directly related to pragmatism, maximisation strategies involved 
balancing the aims and objectives of the research against the constraints mentioned 
above. Thus the major variables for each analytical stage were reviewed and the 
most useful were prioritised at the expense of the least applicable. This hierarchical 
approach was also adopted in relation to samples and specimens during analysis. 
Thus, whilst all samples and specimens received basic analysis, the samples and 
specimens with the greatest potential for preserving evidence relevant to the 
research questions were separated and received more detailed analysis. It is believed 
that these strategies enabled the available time to be invested in a targeted and 
efficient manner. 
Holistic: Following the brief discussion of the importance of the chane opratoire 
approach in studies of technology (see Chapter 3 section 3.6), and in response to the 
research objective of investigating continuity and variation, this research 
methodology adopted a holistic approach to analyses, most notable in the ceramic 
studies, seeking to analyse as many relevant analytical variables as possible within 
the time constraints of a PhD framework.  
Consistency: This research had the potential to generate large quantities of site 
location data, archaeological ceramics and zooarchaeological specimens, and to a 
lesser degree palaeobotanical remains from a variety of sites. Therefore it was 
essential that a single and systematic analytical methodology be developed for each 
stage of analysis that allowed the results from each context and site to be compared. 
Thus a level of standardisation, quantification and overall consistency was required 
throughout the research. In response all records were recorded on standardised 
forms, with a focus on a wide range of quantifiable categories with the option of 
additional qualitative notes. 
Following the re-assertion of the research aims and limitations, and the identification 
of the design criteria, this chapter will now describe the methodology employed in 
response to these issues, that tackled the identification of archaeological resources 
and the subsequent ceramic, zooarchaeological and palaeobotanic analysis.  
5.2 Identification and Collection 
A suitable methodology was required that was capable of identifying new 
archaeological resources, and re-locating known ones, that contained ceramics, and 
faunal and floral remains, in a variety of regions. With regard to these requirements, 
and based on a preliminary assessment of the specific limitations and possibilities 
afforded in Rwanda a regional survey strategy was chosen. 
Archaeological survey is a broad category and can include a variety of techniques 
ranging from literature reviews (to identify known resources), to field walking (to 
identify previously unknown surficial resources), and to test-unit excavation (to 
identify sub-surface remains). However, whilst a wide range of survey techniques 
exist not all are suitable for every research project and therefore they should be 
applied selectively.  
Fig. 5.1 summarizes and assesses a range of survey techniques, their practical 
application and their interpretative value in relation to this research:

Fig. 5.1 Table showing survey methods 
Based on the results of this review, a number of techniques were prioritised whilst 
others were ruled out (the selected techniques will be discussed in more detail in the 
next section). For example, desktop and pedestrian survey strategies were high 
priorities because they have been proven to be effective in Great Lakes Africa (e.g. 
Reid 2002), are inexpensive and can be readily applied in Rwanda. However, remote 
sensing survey was not conducted during this research because it is expensive and 
the equipment is not readily available in Rwanda. Other techniques, such as close 
interval-core survey were ruled out because they are unsuitable for regional survey, 
or are too time consuming, as is the case with shovel-test pit survey. Rwanda is 
densely populated and whilst permission may be sought relatively quickly to cross 
an individuals land, permission to dig even small holes there may take much longer 
and involve remuneration and negotiations that would have drastically reduced the 
potential land coverage of the survey.  
The aims and objectives of this research necessitated an initial focus on the 
identification of new archaeological sites. Therefore, before continuing to describe 
the site identification strategy it is important to first define what constitutes an 
archaeological site within this research context, because the archaeological site is an 
abstract concept with multiple definitions, that vary depending on each individual 
research project (Hall 1996: 12). For example, at one extreme a single artefact may 
constitute a site, whilst at the other end of the spectrum the term may refer to the 
remains of a town or city. For this research it was decided that single artefacts did 
not constitute a site but that a combination and/or particular density of evidence 
was necessary to attribute site status. A range of above ground archaeological 
evidence that the survey was likely to encounter was considered, including 
archaeological ceramics, faunal remains, lithics, local histories, middens and iron 
smelting waste such as iron slag, tuyeres, disused furnace bases and mining pits. Of 
these, diagnostic ceramics were prioritised within the surface survey because they 
are the most chronologically diagnostic (see Chapter 4 section 4.2). Site status was 
attributed to locations with a sherd density of over ten specimens per 20m x 20m 
area. New sites were identified where surface scatters of finds were separated by 
more than 200m. In the absence of archaeological ceramics, sites were identified on 
the basis of a combination of iron smelting remains and at least one other form of 
evidence. Iron smelting rapidly became extinct in Rwanda after the arrival of 
Europeans who imported cheap scrap metal and discouraged smelting. Thus, in the 
rare absence of archaeological ceramics, site status was attributed based on the 
presence of smelting remains combined with testimony from elders that suggested 
smelting had not taken place there during the past century.  
5.3 Implementing the Survey Methodology 
Desktop survey: During the desktop survey all available published and 
unpublished sources were reviewed and the extant site location data was compiled. 
These sites were then plotted against topographic data from the available historic 
and modern cartographic sources. When this information was combined with other 
geographic layers such as vegetation density and access routes a targeted approach 
to surface survey was developed. This strategy took into account the need to access 
new archaeological resources, whilst also identifying known resources at regional 
scales, by identifying survey zones that were in close vicinity to areas with good 
archaeological preservation but that did not overlap already surveyed areas, or areas 
with limited accessibility. This strategy maximised the potential for the successful 
identification of new archaeological resources whilst also linking this survey area 
with a known body of archaeological data from the published sites.   
Through an assessment of the results of this desktop survey it was decided that a 
six-month non-invasive survey, followed by a six-month sub-surface survey, would 
be conducted in three 15km x 15km zones within three contrasting locales: 
Ruhengeri in the north, Gitarama in the centre, and Butare in the south. This strategy 
was designed to generate data from three geographically and politically distinct 
regions and consequently investigate a diverse cross-section of Rwandas past. 
Ruhengeri is a lacustrine region, situated at the foot of the Virunga volcanic range, 
enjoyed great prestige during Ndoris reign in the 17th century but waned in 
importance at the periphery of the kingdom in later times; Gitarama is a region on 
Rwandas central plateau, was at the heart of the kingdom during the 18th and 19th 
century; and Butare is a riverine region at the southern periphery of the kingdom, 
which was sandwiched between the competing kingdoms of Rwanda and Burundi 
(Vansina 2004: 53-56, 111).   
Pedestrian Survey: The pedestrian survey was the main element of the non-invasive 
regional survey strategy and three complimentary methods were chosen before 
entering the field: systematic transect survey, opportunistic survey and interview 
survey. Systematic transect survey involves walking along parallel lines transecting 
the landscape. Sites are identified based on the occurrence and observation of 
surface archaeological materials and features, which are then recorded with a 
handheld Global Positioning System (GPS) unit, and relevant data which may be of 
significance in spatial analysis are recorded, such as extant archaeological remains, 
altitude, aspect, local environment, site size and density (Hodder and Orton 1976: 
17). Whilst a single researcher may undertake survey, the procedure can be speeded 
up and coverage increased by employing more surveyors spaced at regular intervals 
along parallel transects. During pedestrian survey, representational samples of 
surface assemblages are collected to facilitate ascription of settlement history.  
Opportunistic survey uses the same recording principles but is pragmatic and has 
the potential to identify sites that might otherwise be overlooked. Through this 
strategy specific features in the landscape such as hilltops and riverbanks can be 
directly targeted during the survey. Opportunistic survey is linked to the desktop 
survey when these locations maybe identified. For example in Rwanda, place names 
such as Butare (place of iron ore), and Gisagara (a historic name for a settlement), 
recognised on historic maps can direct the survey to areas of relevant historical 
activity.  
Finally, during interview survey local informants are encouraged to enter into 
informal discussions regarding their knowledge of archaeological materials in the 
surrounding landscape. Their knowledge and opinions are recorded and these may 
lead the surveyor to archaeological resources that may not have been recognised 
during transect and opportunistic survey. These informal interviews may also 
contribute to the interpretation of identified archaeological materials. 
Within the limitations of this fieldwork, and as part of the flexible methodology 
alluded to earlier, the survey strategy was adapted in the field. Once in Rwanda it 
became clear that systematic transect survey was impractical. Although the project 
was aware of Rwandas dramatic landscape we were not prepared for the difficulty 
in crossing from hill to hill. The base of each hill is separated from the next by the 
rivers and marshes that snake around them (Fig. 5.2). The combination of very steep 
hills and rivers with few crossing points made transecting very difficult. This 
problem was compounded by the current socio-political situation in Rwanda. The 
recent conflicts in Rwanda have left behind a lot of suspicion (people are still being 
sought and prosecuted in connection with the 1994 genocide) and have resulted in 
new local administration control measures. For our work, documents had to be 
presented to each local authority at each small settlement and permission had to be 
sought from each landowner to cross or investigate their land. Rwanda is a densely 
populated country with each landowner owning only a small plot of land. Thus, 
within the time limits of the season, transect survey was not practical.  
Fig. 5.2 Photograph showing typical terrain in Rwanda 
Instead, following Robertshaws (1994) survey in Uganda, it was decided to survey 
by way of the available paths and small roads that transect the land. This was made 
possible by the discovery of sources that detailed even the smallest of paths allowing 
us to monitor our progress and to achieve as even coverage as possible (e.g. see Figs. 
6.1, 7.1 and 8.1). Whilst travelling down these routes, time was taken to informally 
interview groups of men, women and children at local centres. Archaeological 
examples such as iron slag and ceramics were shown and explained to the people 
who were asked to contribute any information they had about these objects 
occurring locally. Local people in rural Rwanda are well aware of their immediate 
environments because with a subsistence economy they literally live off the land and 
this strategy proved extremely fruitful. Although archaeological ceramics were more 
difficult for them to distinguish from modern wares, iron slag, which was often to 
blame for the breaking of their hoes, was readily identifiable and re-locatable, and 
more intensive survey undertaken around these finds often led us to further 
remains. The opportunistic survey was combined with this systematic and intensive 
informant and path survey and when information of potential resources 
immediately outside of the 15km x 15km zones was gathered these leads were also 
followed up. Site location variables recorded during the survey include, site 
elevation and aspect, find density, surface assemblage composition, distance to fresh 
water, typological date (based on a diagnostic surface assemblage) and site size. 
These variables were quick to record and simple to standardise.  
Whilst the surface survey was highly successful, identifying over 150 new sites, it 
was important to also employ a sub-surface survey strategy. The site location data, 
as with all surface surveys, is heavily biased in favour of the most visible surface 
remains (discussed further in section 5.5 and Chapter 6 section 6.1). Total 
identification of past human activity in the landscape is impossible with any survey 
strategy. For example: preservation is never total; those sites that are preserved may 
be obscured by vegetation or may not have surface remains; surveyors may not 
recognise all visible remains; and it is rare that a survey can achieve total surface 
coverage. Furthermore, surface assemblages are often mixed, hindering dating, and 
revealing little about the sub-surface nature of the sites and the past activities that 
have taken place there. Therefore it was essential to employ a sub-surface survey 
strategy to collect stratigraphically controlled archaeological assemblages to add to 
our limited understanding of the survey sites and to address the stated research aims 
(Bower 1986). 
Test Unit Excavation: An excavation strategy was designed that maximised the 
chance for the recovery of suitable archaeological assemblages by selecting the most 
promising survey sites based on surface assemblage density and composition and on 
the identification of sub-surface deposits, such as those seen in road-cut sections. 
Test-unit excavation was selected, rather than open-excavation, because it is well 
suited to the exploration of vertical stratigraphic relationships. This was an 
important consideration because this research was often dealing with previously 
unexplored sites where the initial concern was the establishment of a site chronology 
alongside the collection of archaeological materials for analysis. To increase the 
comparability of test-unit excavation assemblages recovered from survey sites the 
unit size was standardised to either a single 2m x 2m unit or two 1m x 2m units. 
However, where significant archaeological features or deposits were encountered 
the excavation units were extended to expose these horizontal elements, so that they 
could be better understood. 
Excavation was undertaken using a range of hand tools and in order to maximise 
find recovery all excavated deposits were sieved through a 5mm mesh. This strategy 
allowed for the efficient processing of the deposits whilst collecting all finds >5mm. 
However, this also meant that finds <5mm, such as very small beads and animal 
bones, are likely to be under-represented in the overall assemblage. All 
archaeological materials encountered were collected including worked stone, small 
finds, zooarchaeological specimens, ceramics and iron slag. 
The excavation strategy followed the single context recording method (see MOLAS 
1994). This involves planning and excavating each context separately as it is 
encountered. This can be contrasted with multiple context recording where plans are 
created at opportunistic stages during the work as particular relationships are best 
revealed. Single context recording was preferred because it is more standardised and 
can thus be employed by multiple excavators working concurrently across a site 
without reducing overall consistency. All contexts encountered were planned and 
levelled using a dumpy level before excavation. Once excavation of a unit was 
completed sections were drawn to illustrate the vertical relationships of the deposits 
encountered and samples were taken.  
This is a basic excavation strategy that has been well explored in the region by the 
author and others (e.g. Reid 2002; Ashley 2005) and which can be readily applied 
using the available materials in Rwanda. This strategy was designed to maximise the 
recovery of archaeological materials whilst minimising the potential time 
expenditure. Unfortunately by employing test-unit excavation the research rarely 
involved the total or quantifiable excavation of a single deposit, or allowed for an 
extensive horizontal understanding of the sites, thus restricting spatial 
understanding of feature relationships and hindering investigation into social 
aspects. However, it is believed these limitations are acceptable in a situation where 
little was known of the sub-surface nature of the sites and the establishment of site 
chronology and the collection of archaeological assemblages were of prime concern.  
5.4 Post Excavation Methodology 
5.5 Site Location Analysis 
As mentioned earlier, the surface survey results are biased in favour of certain 
materials and locations and as a result the interpretative potential of these have been 
drastically reduced. For example the value of comparing surface survey sites based 
on find densities and site sizes is questionable when information regarding the size 
and percentage of the deposits, that artefacts have eroded out of, are unknown. 
Potentially, large sites with significant sub-surface deposits and low rates of erosion 
may be recorded as small sites, compared to less important sites with higher rates of 
erosion that have left larger more dense surface assemblages. Thus whilst the survey 
data will make a significant empirical contribution to this research through the 
identification of new archaeological resources it will only be used to make crude 
interpretations based on comparisons with extant settlement models in the region.  
5.6 Ceramic Analysis 
In order to develop the most appropriate ceramic analysis methodology it is 
important to review the research question, and the related research objectives, that 
this stage of analysis aims to explore.  
Research Question: 
What subtle continuities and variations can be identified in Rwandan Iron Age 
ceramics in contrast to the solid and inflexible framework previously used? (see 
Chapter 4 section 4.7). 
Related Research Objectives:  
1/ The identification of Iron Age archaeological ceramics in discrete dateable 
archaeological contexts.  
2/ The identification of ceramic anomalies and/or patterns in production and use 
through the analysis of archaeologically identifiable variables.  
3/ The identification of long-term ceramic histories at localised scales with an 
emphasis on recognising and celebrating variability. 
Each stage of the ceramic methodology will be designed with reference to these 
research goals. 
Ceramic Recovery and Post Excavation Processing: 
Ceramics are often found at Iron Age archaeological sites in Great Lakes Africa (see 
Chapter 4 section 4.2). Pots were a common feature of Iron Age life and ceramics 
preserve well because they are durable and are not subject to the same preservation 
pressures as organic material such as palaeobotanics and zooarchaeological remains. 
Therefore, it was highly likely that archaeological ceramics would be encountered 
during surface survey and test-unit excavation. Whilst surface remains were used to 
help identify new archaeological sites and to suggest suitable locations for test-unit 
excavation, they were not analysed further because they are likely to be mixed 
reducing their interpretative value. Archaeological ceramics for analysis were 
recovered during excavation from within the test-excavation units and from the 
sieve as deposits were screened. These remains were bagged according to context 
and were washed before analysis.  
Defining the Analytical Variables 
Having restated the relevant research question and objectives, it is now important to 
review the major ceramic analytical variables, their sources and their 
appropriateness for this research. Thus, Fig. 5.3 follows Ashleys (2005: 151) review, 
which she conducted for her examination of ceramics from the northern shores of 
Lake Victoria. Her review was based on the Prehistoric Ceramics Research Group 
guidelines (1995) amongst other sources (see Clark 1983; Gibson & Woods 1997; 
Rice 1987; Rye 1981; see also David 1972; Shott 1996; Skibo et al 1997). Ashleys 
work is highly relevant to this research because it is the most recent review 
developed specifically for Great Lakes Africa. Furthermore, by following Ashleys 
methodology this research can be contextualised within one of the most extensive 
reviews of Great Lakes African ceramics ever conducted. Nevertheless, the 
methodology presented here was adapted in relation to the specific research 
questions and objectives of this research.

Fig. 5.3 Table showing the interpretive application of ceramic variables (reproduced with permission 
from Ashley 2005: 152) 
Ashley (2005: 153) identified four pertinent and practical research areas for Great 
Lakes Africa ceramics, including: function and use, production systems, social 
expression and identification and definition.  
Identification and definition is important because it can help to place ceramic 
phenomena within an established typology, to create new typologies, or to develop 
old ones. Identification and definition is achieved by describing as many variables as 
possible and by identifying significant patterns within these. Thus, only through a 
holistic approach to ceramics can the full variability of ceramic manifestations and 
patterning be appreciated. This approach enabled this research to analyse for 
previously unidentified ceramic manifestations and to develop a more textured 
nuanced understanding of existing ones.  
When ceramics are found sufficiently complete and in sufficient numbers, a 
consideration of their function and use can reflect generalised practices and 
concerns of the communities or individuals that made and used them. This is 
because some vessel shapes are more or less suited for various functions. For 
example, plates are not useful for holding liquids but are more appropriate for 
serving, whilst variables such as vessel size and opening diameter may reflect the 
scale of use, such as individual or group. Thus, function and use studies are 
important for this research because they relate to dietary practices and subsistence 
orientation, and may also reflect levels of inter-site standardisation or variation. 
Ashley (2005: 153) found that vessel form and rim type are the most revealing 
archaeologically accessible variables concerning function and use. However, there 
are problems associated with attributing use based on form, for example attributions 
are commonly based on modern values and assumptions, and often cannot take into 
account the particular and perhaps contrasting values of the original users. 
Furthermore, information relating to vessel form and size may not be readily 
available depending on the degree of preservation for the archaeological assemblage 
and thus interpretations may be based on limited results. Thus, during this research 
where vessels were sufficiently complete this research attempted to investigate use 
and function. However, following this discussion, these results were used 
conservatively at a crude scale of interpretation. For example, assemblages were 
analysed for the ratio of serving vessels to storage vessels and for vessels more 
suited to holding liquids and those that are not.  
Production system analysis refers to the scale at which the ceramics were 
manufactured. For example, were pots made in an individuals spare time for their 
personal use or were they made by a specialised group of potters working full time 
to be traded to an extended group of people. This information may relate to wider 
social structures and may reflect degrees of social control such as localised or 
centralised socio-political structures. The chane opratoire method of analysis is very 
important here. This method has been promoted by ethnographic and 
anthropological studies that have identified multiple socially meaningful variations 
contained within the technological production sequence (see Chapter 3 section 3.6). 
However, archaeologists are rarely privy to the same degree of information as 
ethnographers and anthropologists who are in the unique position of having living 
practitioners with whom they can interact and interview. Thus archaeologists must 
elucidate what they can from the available archaeologically preserved variables. 
With this in mind, Ashley (2005: 154) identified a range of archaeologically accessible 
variables including fabric, manufacturing technique, drying, firing and various 
surface treatments. These variables were recorded during this research and levels of 
standardisation within these were assessed to crudely suggest whether these reflect 
individual, craft or industrial scales of production.  
Social expression may be present in many different ceramic variables as has been 
shown through the chane opratoire approach. However, in the absence of such rich 
degrees of data, archaeological studies tend to focus on decoration as the most 
obvious outward expression of group or individual meaning. Social expression is a 
pertinent ceramic variable for this research because it can help to develop social 
histories within the Iron Age in Rwanda. However, it is believed that it will be one of 
the most difficult to access and interpret. Whilst it is relatively simple to collect and 
record decorative evidence from archaeological ceramics there is no standard 
interpretative framework with which to follow. For example, ethnographic studies 
have shown that amongst other things decoration can reflect identity, belonging and 
communication, at individual, family, community, or larger societal levels (see 
Chapter 3 section 3.6). However, in the absence of rich ethnographic, historic or 
archaeological extant bodies of evidence, it is difficult or impossible to interpret 
which is the salient expression. Thus, whilst decoration was analysed as part of the 
identification and definition stage it was only analysed in relation to social 
expression where significant anomalies occurred or where assemblages were 
recovered from discrete archaeological features such as burials.   
Thus, in response to this review, and Ashleys (2005) methodology, the following 
variables were selected for analysis: fabric type, weight, vessel form, rim style, rim 
diameter, body thickness, decoration type and position, and surface treatment. 
Analytical Procedure 
Following the maximisation criteria set out earlier, a hierarchical system was 
employed during ceramic analysis. This prioritised the most informative sherds and 
ensured that sufficient time was invested in sherds with the greatest chance of 
revealing evidence related to the key objectives already discussed. Therefore, all 
sherds below 2cm x 2cm were separated, counted, weighed and removed from the 
study before detailed analysis began. These small sherds were the least informative 
and their removal allowed more time to be focused on the most complete vessels. 
The remaining assemblage was subject to a two-tier analysis: total sherd analysis and 
reconstructable sherd analysis. During total sherd analysis, all sherds were briefly 
described but those that were more informative and enabled partial or total 
reconstruction of a vessel were separated for more detailed reconstructable sherd 
analysis. 
Total sherd analysis first involved the grouping of all sherds greater than 2cm x 2cm 
into fabric categories. In the absence of detailed manufacturing data, the main source 
of technological information collected was the identification and profiling of fabric 
categories. Technological production information is important because it has been 
shown to reflect issues of production and social expression, and may aid ceramic 
identification and definition (see Chapter 3 section 3.7). Van Grunderbeek et al. 
(1983) have investigated this variable in Rwanda and Burundi and they found that a 
variety of raw materials were in plentiful supply across the countries, suggesting 
that fabric patterning will be a localised phenomenon. Therefore during this research 
different fabric groups were established for each site. However, where significant 
similarities between fabrics occurred at different sites these were explored. 
Following Ashleys (2005) methodology for fabric category attribution, based on the 
PPRG guidebook (1995), fabric categories were established on the following 
variables: colour, firing conditions, texture, structure of fresh break, inclusions 
(shape, quantity, composition, size), and possible cultural/typological associations. 
Each category was recorded on a standardised form that was added to as fabric 
category definitions developed throughout each sites analysis (see Fig. 5.4). Each 
fabric group was weighed and counted and the number and types of decoration 
observed were recorded along with surface treatment and potential typological 
grouping. Finally, all reconstructable sherds were removed for further analysis.  
Fig. 5.4. Example of a fabric recording form used during fabric analysis within this research 
The reconstructable sherd analysis stage focused on the sherds that could inform on 
the size and form of the complete vessel, categories of information that relate directly 
to all of the key objectives outlined earlier in this chapter. During reconstructable 
sherd analysis the following variables were recorded: fabric type, form, rim style, 
rim diameter, body thickness, decoration type and placement, surface treatment, 
cultural attribution and quality of execution. To aid statistical manipulation of the 
data all of the possible types relating to these variables were given a letter and 
number code allowing for standardisation and the compilation of large sets of data.

5.7 Zooarchaeological Analysis 
In order to develop the most appropriate faunal analysis methodology it is 
important to review the research question, and the related research objectives, that 
this stage of analysis aims to address.  
Research Questions: 
What archaeological evidence exists to support a subsistence-economic trichotomy 
in pre-colonial Rwanda? 
And where this null hypothesis is not supported: 
What can we say archaeologically about foragerfarmer relations in the Rwandan 
Iron Age? 
Related Research Objectives:  
1/ The identification of subsistence economic evidence, specifically the identification 
of foraged or herded remains. 
2/ The identification of evidence relating to the scale and manner of production and 
means of procurement. For example, were these specialised or non-specialised 
practices or were these the result of trade.  
3/ The identification of long-term subsistence histories at localised scales with an 
emphasis on recognising and celebrating variability. 
Each stage of the faunal methodology was designed with reference to these research 
goals. 
Faunal Recovery: The manner in which zooarchaeological samples are collected 
during excavation affects the overall assemblage. For example, if faunal remains are 
only recovered by hand from within the excavation trench then microfauna are 
likely to be under-represented compared to the larger, and therefore easier to 
recognise, macrofauna and megafauna. This problem can be dealt with by 
employing a deposit screening/sieving strategy using an appropriate mesh size. 
Whilst small mesh sizes will increase the sample they will reduce the speed at which 
deposits can be processed, conversely large sizes will speed up processing but 
reduce the sample size. Mesh size is thus dependant on the specific requirements of 
each research project. For example, Stahl (1996) suggests using a <1mm mesh in 
order to collect all identifiable bones. This time consuming approach was not 
suitable for this research and it was believed that a 5mm mesh would be effective at 
collecting material from most species likely to have been used within the human 
diet. Although small fish bones may be lost, fish vertebra and cranial fragments will 
not. As OConnor (2000: 33) highlights, even when mesh sizes are large and 
collection incomplete, their use at least brings in sampling consistency.  
During this research all excavated deposits were passed through sieves by hand. 
Purpose built sieving machinery was not available in Rwanda and would have been 
impractical and problematic because it requires electricity and water, which are in 
limited supply in rural Rwanda. This maximisation strategy is in contrast to 
reductive strategies, involving the sampling of a percentage of the excavated 
deposits, employed where assemblage sizes are likely to be large (e.g. Levitan 1983). 
In east and central Africa zooarchaeological remains are often poorly preserved 
resulting in small assemblage sizes (Young and Thompson 1999; Marshall 2000). 
Thus, a maximisation strategy was preferred instead of a reductive one. Therefore, 
where zooarchaeological concentrations were identified they were directly targeted. 
The final recovery stage involves separating the faunal specimens from the sieved 
material. Care was taken during this stage to identify all faunal remains present. 
Selection of Analytical Variables 
Having reviewed the main research questions, established the related research 
objectives and described the method of recovery to be employed, it is now necessary 
to review and show the prioritisation of the range of analytical variables that best 
address the specified research question and objectives. Following the pragmatic 
maximisation strategy outlined earlier, it was also important to consider the 
practical limitations of this research programme. For example, whilst an estimate of 
dietary contribution is important for the investigation of subsistence practices and 
the relative importance of taxa within the diet, it requires an extensive comparative 
collection that must be supplemented with live meat weights for each individual 
within the comparative collection that the excavated specimen is compared with. 
Such collections are rare, making the identification of appropriate individuals for 
comparison very time consuming, limiting the usefulness of this approach.  Thus, 
the major zooarchaeological analytical variables have been reviewed in the table 
below (Fig. 5.8). Each variable has been assessed for its ease of collection, 
interpretative application and usefulness for this research programme. The summary 
presented here is based upon OConnor (2000) and Reitz and Wing's (1999) 
comprehensive methodological reviews.

Wing (1999) and OConnor (2000). 
This review has identified four main analytical objectives appropriate for this 
research:  taxonomy, age at death, modification and body dimension. These research 
topics and the sources with which they will be addressed will be described in detail 
below. 
Taxonomic Attributions and Estimating the Relative Number of Individuals 
Present  
During the first stage of zooarchaeological analysis, each specimen was described 
and was ideally attributed to a taxonomic group. This information was later 
processed so that an estimate of the relative number of individuals present in an 
assemblage could be made. Taxonomic attribution was essential for all the following 
analytical stages because it is difficult to appreciate the significance of a particular 
assemblage or specimen without first understanding the species that it represents. 
During taxonomic attribution a hierarchical approach to specimen analysis was 
adopted which prioritised the most informative specimens whilst removing the 
least. Although it is theoretically possible for every specimen to be attributed to an 
element and taxon group, this was not always practical. Archaeological bones are 
rarely recovered complete and are more commonly heavily fractured and 
fragmented. The more incomplete a specimen the more time investment is required 
for a confident identification. Therefore, a balance must be achieved that maximises 
the number of specimens identified to species within a PhD timeframe. Thus, a 
hierarchical system was employed that invested the most analytical time on the most 
complete, readily identifiable, specimens. Every assemblage from each context was 
divided first into those fragments that had the least chance of being attributed to an 
element grouping. These small heavily fragmented specimens were counted and 
separated from the total assemblage and these commonly included thin shaft 
fragments with little or no readily observable diagnostic features. The remaining 
assemblage was then separated into taxonomic element groups. Identification of the 
element was an essential stage towards the attribution of a taxon to a specimen. 
Having attributed a specimen to an element group it must then be compared to a 
comparative collection in order for a confident taxonomic attribution to be made.  
When a specimen is sufficiently complete and can be compared to a suitable 
reference collection it may be possible by process of elimination to identify the taxon 
that it is from. OConnor (2000: 39) suggests that instead of taxonomic 
identification this process should be referred to as taxonomic attributions because 
it represents a best fit and is not definitive. OConnor summarises how taxonomic 
attribution is achieved by asking a series of questions of each specimen that has been 
attributed to an element group:  
What size animal is this from?  
What type of animal is this from? 
What possible animals from this geographic region and period could this animal 
therefore be? 
From this narrowed down list it is possible to go to a reference collection and 
compare the specimen and potentially arrive at a confident match. Some faunal 
elements will be more identifiable than others and thus it may not always be 
possible to take a specimen all the way to species. Where this occurs it may instead 
be possible to attribute an animal size and type e.g. large mammal or large bovid. 
This is often the case for sheep (Ovis aries) and goat (Capra hircus) specimens, which 
are notoriously difficult to differentiate and often can only be assigned to an 
Ovis/Capra group (e.g. Payne 1969, 1985a). Although the attribution of all specimens 
to species was an ideal for this research it was balanced against the considerable time 
investment that this required and thus not all specimens were attributed to species. 
Furthermore, it is understood that attribution is a best fit and is not definitive. 
Therefore it was more important to identify a specimen accurately to a general 
category that had an acceptable level of confidence, than to a precise category with a 
low level of confidence. This research utilised the detailed domestic reference 
collection at University College Londons, Institute of Archaeology, zooarchaeology 
laboratory and the more extensive wild reference collection held at the Natural 
History Museum, London. 
Having made a taxonomic attribution, the proportion of each specimen preserved 
was recorded. This was important because it reflects the confidence with which a 
taxonomic attribution was made, and may also relate to butchery practices. To 
reduce subjectivity during this stage it is usual for categories of convenience to be 
employed that relate to element zones, or the percentage of the element preserved. 
Elements may be divided into a number of morphological zones and where these are 
preserved on a specimen these are recorded. Whilst this is slower than estimating 
the percentage of an element preserved in the specimen, it is specific and more 
accurately describes each specimen and zonal categories are suited to studies of 
butchery and post-depositional processes (OConnor 2000: 41). Thus, zonal 
categories were adopted here, however, because the research questions do not 
involve a detailed study of butchery practice or post-depositional processes, and in 
order to speed up the analysis, they were simplified to three zones (proximal, shaft 
and distal) and four qualifiers (fragment, fractured, half, whole). 
Before the relative frequencies of taxa can be estimated the side of the body that each 
specimen comes from must be recorded. The side of the body that an element comes 
from is important because it relates directly to the calculation of the minimum 
number of individuals (MNI) present in an assemblage, an important calculation 
when estimating relative frequencies of taxa (to be discussed further below). 
However, side identification is only appropriate for some elements. For example, 
vertebrae, cranium and sternum are in the central column of the body and do not 
have a side, whilst ribs and metapodials occur many times on each side of the body 
and their interpretive potential for MNI is reduced.  
Estimating relative frequencies of taxa commonly involves two different 
calculations: the number of identified specimens (NISP), and the minimum number 
of individuals (MNI). Specimen weight may also be used to estimate the relative 
frequency of taxa. However, this method was not employed here because it is 
inappropriate for comparison of species with potentially large differences in body 
size (Chaplin 1971, Casteel 1978). Whilst estimates of the relative frequencies of taxa 
have many interpretative applications, outlined in the review, they were only used 
here to crudely evaluate the relative importance of animals in diets obtained through 
various subsistence strategies. 
The number of identified specimens (NISP) or total number of fragments (TNF) is a 
specimen count, which is often used to estimate the relative frequency of taxa (Reitz 
and Wing 1999: 191). This approach has been criticised because it assumes that 
fragmentation and recovery rates are uniform for each taxon and that all taxa are 
equally likely to be counted (Grayson 1984; Ringrose 1993). Different taxonomic 
groups have varying amounts of identifiable hard tissue, with varying survival rates, 
and thus some are likely to be over represented compared to others (Gilbert et al. 
1982). Furthermore, it is also difficult to establish if specimens are independent of 
one another or if they come from the same individual (OConnor 2000: 56). Gilbert 
and Singer (1982: 31) describe NISP as ideal for ideal samples only. However, 
others have suggested that interdependence is not such a problem and that high 
levels of taphonomic attrition reduce the probability that anyone individual 
contributed more than one specimen to the assemblage (e.g. Gautier 1984).  
The Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI) is the smallest number of individuals 
that are necessary to account for all the skeletal elements of a particular species 
found in an assemblage (White 1953: 397; Klein and Cruz-Uribe 1984: 24-38). White 
(1953) was the first to use MNI within archaeology, with later refinements by 
Chaplin (1971). MNI works by separating the most abundant skeletal element of a 
particular taxon into right and left sides, excluding axial elements, and counting 
each of these. The side that has the highest number is taken to represent the 
minimum number of individuals (MNI) necessary to have created that assemblage. 
Whilst MNI is a relatively simple and conservative calculation it has also received a 
lot of criticism (Plug and Plug 1990). MNI is affected by similar biases to NISP, 
including: the number of identifiable elements in each animal, site formation 
processes, recovery techniques and laboratory procedures. However, unlike NISP, 
MNI is solely an analytical product (Reitz and Wing 1999: 195).  The MNI should not 
be interpreted as actual numbers of individuals used at the site because the actual 
number of individuals represented is likely to have been more. Furthermore, it 
should not be used to represent the minimum number of whole animals because 
often only portions of animals will be brought to the site (Grayson 1984: 62-63). 
Therefore, the NISP represents the maximum number of individuals potentially 
represented in an assemblage and the MNI is the minimum, thus neither is the real 
figure so neither is right but also neither is wrong (Klein and Cruz-Uribe 1984: 202). 
However, despite these and other identified problems, MNI continues to be used 
widely.  
A number of analysts have attempted to mitigate these problems with further 
calculations. For example, Chaplin (1971: 69-70) and Klein and Cruz-Uribe (1984: 26) 
advocate matching a process that can increase the MNI by considering other factors 
such as age, sex and size along with side. Element percentage can also be factored in, 
for example Klein and Cruz-Uribe (1984: 26-29) suggest recording the fraction of the 
element present and then adding these together. Alternatively, Albarella and Davis 
(1996: 3-4) suggest that only dimensions with at least 50% preserved should be 
counted, with some exceptions such as metapodia. Both of these techniques may be 
appropriate where there are very large samples and a danger of counting fragments 
of the same element as separate individuals. However, it is unnecessary where 
sample sizes are small and fragments of the same elements can often be easily 
identified.  
Animal bone quantification is complicated and its interpretative potential is dubious 
if it is used uncritically because it is difficult to establish a clear relationship between 
the archaeological assemblage, the killed population and the living community. 
Relative taxa calculations fail to take into account taphonomic processes, and bias 
during collection and identification. For example, Payne (1985b) argues that NISP 
minimises the importance of species only represented by a few specimens but 
exaggerates the importance of species with more readily identifiable elements. He 
also suggests that MNI emphasises the importance of rare animals in small well-
recovered samples because one identifiable element will equal one whole individual. 
Thus, NISP and MNI can only be considered to be a description of the archaeological 
assemblage and not the death assemblage or the living community, thus any 
interpretation must reflect that because beyond the archaeological assemblage NISP 
and MNI lack validity (OConnor 2000: 55). However, as OConnor (2000: 65) 
suggests, even though each method brings with it its own noise, which masks 
that signal, there is useful information in the NISP and MNI, but in order to use that 
data accurately, analysts should adopt conservative approaches to interpretation 
focusing on large anomalies not slight differences.  
Following this review, the zooarchaeological analysis conducted during this research 
adopted a conservative approach to the estimation of the relative frequencies of taxa. 
NISP was calculated to describe the maximum number of individuals represented by 
an assemblage and MNI to describe the minimum, and relative frequencies will only 
be discussed where large, potentially significant, anomalies have been identified. 
Estimating Age at Death  
Forms of aging evidence include the state of epiphysal fusion of post-cranial 
specimens, and the state of eruption and wear in teeth. These data can indicate the 
approximate age when an individual died and this is important for estimating kill-
off patterns, which can reveal information about hunting and husbandry practices. 
For example if individuals cluster in a single age class this can indicate targeted 
hunting or culling strategies (Reitz and Wing 1999: 181). 
Fusion of the epiphyses of the post-cranial skeleton: The state of fusion of the 
elements from the post-cranial skeleton can help create an estimate of age at death of 
an individual. In a typical immature animal a limb bone has three parts: the shaft or 
diaphysis, and the proximal and distal epiphyses. The epiphyses are attached to the 
diaphysis by the epiphysial cartilage, which allows bone growth on either side of the 
cartilage. When an element is fully grown and has reached maturity the epiphyses 
will fuse to the diaphysis. Elements do not all fuse at the same time but follow a 
predictable sequence in mammals. However, these sequences vary from species to 
species and may vary within a species due to nutrition, environment and disease (for 
an example of fusion sequences see Amorosi 1989).  
Fusion data can be processed to generate age at death sets. However, there is no 
agreement on the calculations to be used and different calculations can produce 
contrasting age sets (Watson 1978). It is rare that archaeological elements, isolated 
from the complete skeleton, can give precise age at death information Therefore all 
age at death estimates must be viewed as ranges rather than points. For example, 
Chaplin (1971: 80-81) recommends dividing the age groups into three based on the 
age at which fusion generally occurs: 10 months or less, between 18 and 24 months 
and those older than 36 months. Another problem with fusion data, and other age at 
death sources is the unknown relationship between individual specimens. Thus, the 
relative age of a single individual may be estimated several times within one 
assemblage. Furthermore, unfused and incompletely ossified specimens are also less 
likely to survive in the archaeological record than fused ones  (Klein and Cruz-Uribe 
1984: 43).  
Unfortunately fusion sequences are not available for most central African species 
likely to be found in Iron Age Rwanda. Therefore fusion data will only be used to 
suggest a crude age at death for individuals. Following Chaplin (1971), fusion data 
will be used to suggest one of three age at death estimates for each specimen. 
Unfused specimens will be used to attribute immaturity, fusing elements will be 
used to attribute juvenile status and fused specimens will suggest mature status. 
These data will be used conservatively to explore issues of standardisation and 
variety in husbandry practice. However, it must be restated that fusing happens at 
different ages for different bones, thus fusing will only be compared within single 
element categories for the same species where appropriate. 
Dental Eruption and Attrition 
Dental eruption and attrition data can also be used to help estimate the age at death 
of an individual. However, unlike fusion data, which is most useful for young 
animals, eruption and attrition data can be used throughout the life of the animal 
(Klein and Cruz-Uribe 1984). It begins when the first tooth erupts and continues 
through the life of the animal giving a relative indicator of age. These studies rely 
upon the premise that eruption sequences and timings, and rates of attrition are 
predictable. However, whilst this may generally be true there are exceptions. For 
example, Klein and Cruz-Uribe (1984: 52-55) found that individual variation may 
exist within populations of the same species and Grant (1978) found that teeth might 
not be uniform on both the left and right side of the mandible of the same 
individual. Therefore, it is important to remain conservative with interpretations of 
this data, prioritising large assemblages and the most complete specimens where 
possible. To reduce errors through variation Payne (1973) and Grant (1978) suggest 
combining both eruption and wear sequences.  
Tooth Eruption: If an individual dies before all their permanent teeth have fully 
erupted it is possible to estimate the age at death of that animal based on the stage of 
eruption through comparison with established sequences. This method is considered 
to be more reliable than fusion data because enamel is more durable and therefore is 
more likely to be preserved giving a greater chance for both old and young 
specimens to survive. However, like fusion data it is subject to variation and should 
thus only be used to generate age classes and not specific ages (Reitz and Wing 1999: 
184-185).  
Tooth Wear: Eruption sequence data is useful for the estimation of age at death up 
to the age at which all teeth are fully erupted but this often happens well before the 
maximum age of an animal. From this point on attrition is used to measure the 
degree of wear and estimate age. Tooth wear analysis assumes that wear is constant 
and predictable, however, like eruption and fusion sequences variation exists due to 
environmental and nutritional pressures (e.g. Lowe 1967). The degree of attrition is 
measured in two ways, by direct measurement of the height of the tooth, or by 
examination of the pattern of dentine exposure produced as the enamel of the 
occlusal surface is worn away. Measuring attrition by dentine exposure patterns 
requires a form by which wear stages can be classified. Payne (1973, 1987) has 
developed such a sequence for sheep and goat by noting the sequence in which 
different cusps of each tooth come into wear and the sequence of exposure of the 
dentine as the enamel is worn away (OConnor 2000: 87). Different combinations of 
the attrition states reached by teeth in one mandible then allow that mandible to be 
put in one of a series of classes, which have approximate age-equivalents based on 
observations from modern animals. Grant (1982) has published diagrams of tooth 
wear stages for the lower fourth premolars and molars of cattle, sheep and goats, 
and pigs, requiring specimens to be recorded in pre-determined categories to give 
age ranges.  
Therefore, during this research dental eruption and attrition will be recorded and 
translated into estimates of age at death for cattle, sheep and goats, because these are 
the only taxa with well established published sequences that are likely to be 
encountered during this research (see Grant 1982 and Payne 1973, 1987). Where 
sufficient data exists this has been compiled to explore kill off patterns and infer 
specialised or non-specialised forms of animal husbandry, which is one of the main 
objectives of this stage of the research.  
Modification: Burning, Butchery and Gnawing 
Modification refers to the alteration of a specimen from its original whole and may 
be the result of human action, deliberate or unintentional, or animal action. 
Observation of bone modification may reflect human practices during production, 
consumption and/or deposition. 
Burning: Burning can be recognised through the observation of charring or 
discoloration of a specimen. Burning suggests that the specimen has come into 
contact with fire, which may be the result of deliberate processes such as waste 
disposal. Whilst it is possible that specimens could become burnt during cooking 
this is unlikely because the burning of food during roasting is likely to affect the 
meat more than the bone, due to the protection the meat affords the bone and the fat 
present in the bone tissue itself. Whilst different degrees or types of burning may be 
divided into various categories to indicate different temperatures (for example see 
OConnor 2000: 45), during this research it will only be identified as present or 
absent because grading is of limited interpretative value and is a highly subjective 
attribution. In some zooarchaeological studies the location of burning may also be 
recorded because this can reflect cooking practices such as spit roasting (OConnor 
2000: 45). However, in the absence of detailed ethnographic records or experimental 
data, that are not available for Iron Age Rwanda, the interpretative value of such 
studies is questionable. Therefore in order to save time burning location has not be 
considered further.  
Butchery: Butchery evidence can be identified by the observation of diagnostic 
markings and fractures on a specimen. Butchery marks are the result of deliberate 
human action and they may be left on bones during a variety of pre-depositional 
stages, including killing, skinning, jointing and eating. Butchery marks may be 
produced with a variety of tools made from a variety of materials such as stone and 
metal (OConnor 2000: 45). Butchery marks can indicate butchery practice, dietary 
preference, hunting practices, levels of standardisation, and meat availability (Brain 
1981). Butchery marks can be divided into two general categories: cut marks made as 
a result of cutting overlying tissues by a knife, leaving very fine long parallel 
incisions, or chop marks, made by using an axe or cleaver to remove muscle from the 
bone that remove semi-circular wedges from the bone (OConnor 2000: 45). There 
are also other marks such as punctures made by hammering the bone that leave 
percussion marks radiating out from a circular point of impact. Within this research 
observed butchery marks and their positions have been identified and classified as 
either knife cut marks, chop marks or puncture marks.  
Gnawing: In contrast to butchery marks, gnawing marks are normally not related to 
human action but are more often attributed to the actions of animals such as cats, 
dogs and rodents. Specimens with gnawing marks may have been introduced to an 
archaeological site by wild scavengers or scavengers may have entered a site and 
gnawed on bone waste discarded by humans. In the later example this may infer 
that bone waste was not immediately interred in a rubbish pit or burnt but was 
discarded and left on the surface long enough for scavengers to access them. This 
scavenging evidence is part of the taphonomic record and should be recorded. It 
may help to explain the inclusion or exclusion of certain elements or it may arise as a 
potential answer to general anomalies seen in an assemblage. Gnawing is not 
random, for example certain bones, and certain parts of bones, will be selected ahead 
of others, such as the proximal end of the humerus, and the scavenging animals may 
leave diagnostic gnawing marks. For example dogs will tend to crunch and chew 
(OConnor 2000: 47). During this research, where gnawing has been identified it has 
been recorded and used to help interpret deposition processes.  
Measurements and Estimates of Body Dimensions 
The size of an elements morphological features can infer the relative size of the 
animal through comparison with other measured specimens. This information can 
be used to help distinguish between closely related species with similar 
morphologies but dissimilar dimensions, and to distinguish wild from domestic taxa 
(Reitz and Wing 1999: 177-178). For example, Payne (1969) distinguished between 
sheep and goat bones through the quantification of morphology. This is also an 
important research topic because a size change in the population over time may 
reflect changes in human or non-human predation, to food availability, or to climatic 
changes (Klein and Cruz-Uribe 1984: 94-98).  
During the initial recording stage, after taxonomic attribution, suitable specimens are 
measured, and this information is processed and interpreted to help estimate an 
individuals original body dimension (e.g. von den Driesch 1976). Measuring is 
usually only applied to particular elements and species that best reflect changes in 
body size and have an established set of standards available for comparison. 
Measuring is also only appropriate in certain research contexts, for example it is 
impractical with large assemblages to measure every bone. Conversely, in small 
assemblages statistical analysis of measurements may not be appropriate because a 
single exceptional individual may disproportionately affect the description of the 
sample.  
An estimate of the body dimension of an individual animal can be achieved by 
either comparing the measurements of morphological features from archaeological 
specimens with reference skeletons or by using indices (Reitz and Wing 1999: 174). If 
an archaeological specimen has shared size characteristics with a reference specimen 
it may be assumed that the individuals also shared the same body dimension (Reitz 
and Wing 1999: 174). However, this relies on the body size data of the reference 
skeleton to have been recorded and archived, which is rare. Instead of direct 
comparison indices based on modern data can be used to estimate body dimension 
(Reitz and Wing 1999: 174). However, there are a variety of different formulae that 
can be used and these can produce dissimilar results (Bartosiewicz 1995: 45).  
Accurate estimation is complicated because a specimens original body dimensions 
will be related to a multitude of influencing factors, including age, sex, geographical 
range, and individual variation (Armitage 1982; Steadman 1980). Yet, much of this 
information will often not be available to the archaeologist. Sample size is also 
important because it influences the range (Simpson et al 1960: 80). Another problem 
is that indices used are based on modern data and cannot take into account historical 
variations in the relationship between element morphology and body dimension. 
Other problems include the measuring of sub-adults as adults after fusing and that 
large well-ossified, fused elements may be removed for use as tools and so may not 
be represented in the sample studied by zooarchaeologists (von den Driesch 1976: 4). 
A good example of why worked bone must also be included in zooarchaeological 
studies. 
Following this review bone measurement data has only been taken for cattle bones 
because these have a well-established standard and these measurements may inform 
on the particular breed of cattle represented, and may also reflect choice in animal 
husbandry and diet, which are directly related to issues of subsistence orientation 
(von den Driesch 1976). However, unfortunately not enough measurable cattle bones 
(those that were sufficiently complete) were identified during the research to make a 
confident attribution of species, such as longhorn or short cattle. Thus, this avenue 
has not been discussed during the results chapters. 
5.8 Palaeobotanical Analysis 
Research Question: 
The related research question for this stage of analysis is the same as for the 
zooarchaeological section:  
What archaeological evidence exists to support a subsistence-economic trichotomy 
in pre-colonial Rwanda?  
And where this null hypothesis is not supported: 
What can we say archaeologically about forager  farmer relations in the Rwandan 
Iron Age? 
Related Research Objectives:  
1/ The identification of subsistence economic evidence, specifically the identification 
of domestic or wild plant remains likely to have been used in the human diet. 
Palaeobotanical sampling and analysis aims to collect and identify evidence relating 
to non-animal contributions to the diet. Unlike the other analytical stages described 
above, it is unnecessary to review the analytical variables for this stage because 
statistical manipulation of the remains was severely curtailed by the size of the 
palaeobotanical assemblage. As Young and Thompson (1999: 63-72) discuss, it is rare 
for palaeobotanic evidence to be preserved in eastern and central Africa due to 
unsuitable soil chemistry and climate.  Therefore it was unlikely that this research 
would encounter assemblages of sufficient size to enable statistical processing and 
comparison of the results. Thus, the focus of this stage of analysis was taxonomic 
attribution of any specimens recovered and the crude investigation of cultivation or 
collection practices that these may reflect.  
In the light of Young and Thompsons (1999) review of palaeobotanical studies in 
Great Lakes Africa, this research adopted a maximisation strategy during 
palaeobotanical sampling. All sealed archaeological deposits and features were 
sampled to increase the chances of identifying preserved floral evidence. Surface 
deposits and unsealed features were not sampled because these have a high chance 
of contamination from modern material.  Ideally a sample of 20 litres was taken from 
each context. This arbitrary quantity was selected because it was believed to be 
practical within a test-unit excavation methodology where contexts were often only 
partially accessible. Furthermore, these small sample sizes facilitated processing 
within a PhD timeframe. However, where small features or deposits were 
encountered this sample size was reduced respectively. Samples were ideally taken 
from the section wall after excavation of each unit had ceased, although in some 
cases this was not possible and discrete features were half sectioned and samples 
were removed in plan. The soil samples were processed in Rwanda where they were 
suspended in water and were passed through three environmental sieves with mesh 
sizes of 2mm, 1mm and 300m in order to collect and separate all remains above 
these sizes. These collected samples were then dried and taken back to University 
College Londons, Institute of Archaeology, palaeobotanical laboratory where Dr 
Dorian Fuller supervised the analysis. The samples were individually analysed 
under a microscope and all palaeobotanic remains were separated and placed in 
sample tubes before they were further analysed aiding taxonomic attribution. 
Taxonomic attribution in palaeobotany is similar to that already described for 
zooarchaeological analysis, it is a process of elimination whereby the possible range 
is narrowed down by geographical region, archaeological period and specimen 
morphology, before a comparative collection can be utilised in a targeted fashion. 
Where a confident attribution can be made this was recorded and used as empirical 
evidence of the presence and presumed utilisation of a particular species at that site.  
5.9 Other Forms of Evidence 
Following the holistic maximisation criteria outlined earlier this research aimed to 
collect as much evidence as possible from a range of sources. For example, charcoal 
was sought for radiocarbon dating. Where suitable samples from sealed contexts 
were identified their three-dimensional position within the test-excavation unit was 
recorded, and they were given an individual sample number and were preserved in 
aluminium foil before being sealed in a sample bag. Other finds such as beads and 
metals were also recovered. Whilst these are not directly relevant to the research 
questions set out here they have added to our understanding of the site occupants 
lives. All metallurgical remains have been submitted to Jane Humphris for her PhD 
study of iron metallurgy in pre-colonial Rwanda and any results forthcoming before 
the completion of this thesis have been summarised within the results chapters (6, 7 
and 8).  
5.10 Structure of the Results 
This research has re-located published sites and identified new archaeological sites 
through six months of archaeological survey in three study zones in Rwanda. 
During a secondary six-month season the most promising of these sites were test-
excavated in order to gather dating evidence, ceramic evidence, zooarchaeological 
evidence and palaeobotanical evidence. These remains have been identified and 
described and where possible these results have been processed and analysed to 
inform on issues pertinent to this research. The results of these two field seasons and 
the subsequent analysis are presented as three separate case studies describing the 
results from each zone, southern, central and northern, in the following three 
chapters (Chapters 6, 7 and 8). Sites will be discussed at a site-by-site level and the 
results will be compiled and contextualised separately (see Chapter 9).  
Chapter Six 
Research Findings from Southern Rwanda:  
Case Study 1 
This chapter presents the results from the systematic survey and excavations in the 
southern study zone. It will first briefly discuss the survey results and will mention 
the unsuccessful test-units excavated at a range of sites, before describing in detail 
the more intensive and successful excavations at Kabusanze (BPS036).  
6.1 Southern Survey Results 
Systematic and opportunistic survey was undertaken in the southern study zone 
over two months from October to November 2005 (Fig. 6.1). The administrative 
centre within this survey zone is called Butare - now Huye - and all new sites 
identified in this zone were given a Butare Pragmatic Survey (BPS) number. In the 
southern survey zone fifty-two new sites were identified along with ten previously 
published sites (Fig. 6.2). With the exception of Mara and Nyirankuba (Hiernaux and 
Maquet 1960; Nenquin 1967a) all the previously published sites are located to the 
south of the survey region and are the result of intensive work by Van Grunderbeek 
(et al. 1983, 2001) and Van Noten (1983) into early iron smelting. Previous 
investigations at these sites have ranged from simple surface identification of 
archaeological materials as at Mara and Nyirankuba to test-unit and furnace base 
excavation as at Kabuye, Cyamakuza and Gahondo.

a BPS number and previously published sites are shown with a settlement name) 
The landscape in the southern survey zone is less dramatic than the central and 
northern survey zones but still varies considerably, fluctuating 400m between the 
highest hilltop and lowest river valleys.  Despite this most hillsides were traversable 
by foot and this allowed for good coverage of the survey zone. A 15 x 15km survey 
zone was established immediately north of the area of intensive work undertaken by 
Grunderbeek et al. (1983) and Van Noten (1983) in order to maximise the potential 
recovery of comparable site data. Unfortunately the survey area could not be 
extended to encompass the more riverine region to the east because this area is next 
to the border with Burundi and was still suffering from rebel incursions at the time 
of the survey. With the exception of BPS008, which we were led to by an informant 
we did not enter this area. 
The southern survey found that sites were well distributed across the zone with an 
almost universal preference for hillsides and hilltops. Sites were not found in the wet 
lowest altitude environments, which occur between the hills at approximately 1400m 
above sea level. However, the majority of sites are in close proximity to these 
locations.  The survey in the southern zone identified seven new sites with Early 
Iron Age material (Fig. 6.3) and re-identified nine previously published sites in the 
southern region, including Nyirankuba, Mara, Bweya, Cyamakuza, Ndora, Gishubi, 
Gahondo, Dahwe and Remera (Hiernux and Maquet 1957; Nenquin 1967a; Van 
Noten 1983). These sites were identified by the presence of Urewe ceramics, and all 
except one, BPS020, were found in association with iron production remains. The 
results show a wide distribution of sites, for example, BPS020 and BPS002 are near 
large rivers, BPS030, BPS035 and BPS050 near smaller rivers and BPS036 and BPS024 
in higher altitude drier zones. The site elevation shows more conformity with seven 
out of eight sites ranging from 1711m to 1753m above sea level (Fig. 6.4). This fits 
well with the evidence from the previously published sites to the south, which were 
all found on or close to hilltops. Van Grunderbeek and Van Notens sites show a 
preference for lower altitudes than those found during the present survey but this is 
not unexpected as the average hilltop altitude drops considerably to the south.

Fig. 6.4. Graph showing total site elevation above sea level for the southern survey zone 
The distribution of these early sites continues to support the claim that Urewe using 
peoples selected sites close to or on the highest points of hills (Van Grunderbeek et 
al. 1983 and Van Noten 1983 for Rwanda, and Maclean 1994/5 and Reid 1994/5 for 
Uganda). The survey considered the possibility that sites may not be visible or 
accessible at the bottom of the valleys being obscured by vegetation, swamps, rivers 
and later deposition. For these reasons every attempt was made to identify and 
explore exposed deposits in these locations. However, it is believed that these valley 
bottoms would have been more inhospitable in the Early Iron Age than they are 
today due to the presence of more dense vegetation and wetter climatic conditions. 
These areas have only recently begun to be cleared during modern times due to 
population and land pressures. Previously these valley areas would have been 
inhospitable due to diseases such as malaria and trypanosomiasis carried by flying 
insects that would have thrived in these waterlogged locales, suggesting that 
without clearance and drainage they may have been unsuitable for settlement. Thus, 
Early Iron Age habitation of these lower zones is unlikely, providing one reason why 
hillside and especially hilltop sites were preferred.  
The survey identified thirty-seven new sites with Late Iron Age material and three 
previously published sites, Bweya, Cyamakuza and Gishubi (Nenquin 1967a; Van 
Noten 1983) in the southern zone. These were identified by the presence of roulette-
decorated ceramics and all were found with iron production remains. Fourteen of 
these sites contained twisted-string roulette-decorated ceramics (Fig. 6.5), thirty-nine 
knotted-strip roulette-decorated ceramics (Fig. 6.6) and thirteen sites contained both. 
Whilst many more sites with Late Iron Age ceramics were identified than sites with 
Early Iron Age ceramics there was no drastic departure in site location, although it 
appears from the site elevation data (Fig. 6.7 and Fig. 6.8) that lower altitude sites 
began to be exploited. These sites are not located within the lower altitude region to 
the south of the survey zone and reflect a new phase of exploitation lower down the 
slopes.

A significant element of the survey in all three regions was the relocation of 
previously published sites. This was important because it enabled the re-assessment 
of known archaeological resources and the establishment of more accurate and 
precise location data for these sites than was achievable in the 1970s when they were 
last visited. It was believed that this location data could produce a comparative 
resource and that any surviving archaeological deposits could be re-excavated in 
order to supplement the material recovered from excavations at newly identified 
survey sites.  The relocation survey was particularly time consuming in the southern 
survey zone because this area has received the most archaeological attention in 
Rwanda and subsequently has produced the most sites. In total the survey 
attempted to relocate fifteen sites and successfully located ten of them.

Survey Summary  
The southern survey has made a significant empirical contribution to our knowledge 
of archaeological sites in southern Rwanda. Whilst these results are clearly subject to 
biases associated with the preservation and visibility of site data and methodological 
limitations (see Chapter 5 section 5.3), the results support Van Grunderbeek et al.s 
(1983) established site location model (see Chapter 4 section 4.8). Sites continue to be 
found located on or just below hilltops in a range of areas, and whilst they are not 
constrained to riverine locations, rivers are always close by, as is the character of the 
landscape.  
The southern survey results are summarized below: 
 There is an increase in site density between the Early Iron Age and the Late 
Iron Age.  
 There is no drastic change in site location, but sites begin to appear further 
down-slope. 
This situation may be a response to the presumed increase in population density 
associated with the development of more specialized economies and the rise of the 
kingdoms in the second millennium AD (see Chapter 4 section 4.8). This shift may 
also reflect the slow clearance of lower altitude bush, creating more space and 
reducing the potential for insect-borne disease.  The high proportion of iron smelting 
remains probably reflects a bias in survey identification. However, this is also a 
historically important area for iron smelting (see Chapter 4 section 4.6) and thus it is 
not surprising that iron slag is commonly found at archaeological sites here. 
6.2 Southern Excavation Results 
In the southern zone test-units were dug at eight sites, including four newly 
identified sites - Kamana/Mugogwe (BPS001), Kabusanze (BPS036), Kamambuye 
(BPS040) and Mpinga (BPS050) - and four previously published sites - Gahondo, 
Cyamakuza I and II (Van Grunderbeek et al. 1983; Van Noten 1983), & Nyirankuba 
(Hiernaux and Maquet 1960; Nenquin 1967a) (Fig. 6.9). These sampled a range of 
surface assemblages and environments. However, only one of the sites, Kabusanze, 
preserved any significant sub-surface archaeological deposits, other than furnace 
bases, which are being investigated as part of a separate PhD on iron-smelting 
conducted by Jane Humphris.  
Fig. 6.9 Satellite image showing the excavated sites from the southern survey zone 
The unsuccessful test-units are outlined here below: 
 Mpinga, BPS050 (southing 02 34.42.1, easting 029 44.33.4 and elevation 
1753m) was identified during survey by a collection of surface Urewe 
pottery, slag and furnace bases. Three 1x1m test-units were excavated to 
0.3m, 0.4m and 0.5m. All encountered sterile clayey-silt deposits and were 
discontinued.   
 Kamabuye, BPS040 (southing 02 28.09.6, easting 029 48.55.3 and elevation 
1551m) was identified during survey by the presence of two possible 
smithing pits in the road and a surrounding scatter of Late Iron Age roulette-
decorated ceramics. Two test-units were excavated to 0.3m and 0.4m before 
finding bedrock. No finds were recovered from the test-units.  
 Kamana/ Mugogwe, BPS001 (southing 02 30.77.9, easting 029 48.04.4 and 
elevation 1633m) was identified during survey by large quantities of slag and 
Late Iron Age roulette-decorated ceramics eroding out of the road. 1x1m and 
1x3m test-units were dug to a depth of 1m and 0.6m respectively. However, 
only modern pottery and occasional slag were encountered in heavily 
disturbed cultivated soils.  
 At Gahondo (southing 02 38.03.8, easting 029 50.40.0 and elevation 1616m), a 
previously published site (Van Grunderbeek et al. 1983; Van Noten 1983) 
with early furnaces, three 1x1m test-units were excavated. All encountered 
sterile deposits to a depth of approximately 0.2m before finding bedrock.  
 At Cyamakuza I (southing 02 35.14.4, easting 029 49.19.0 and elevation 
1659m) four test-units were dug to a depth of 0.05 to 0.25m, which only 
encountered sterile orange clay above bedrock.  
 At Cyamakuza II (southing 02 35.38.8, easting 029 49.27.5 and elevation 
1700m) two test-units were dug to 0.5m and 1m but were stopped before 
reaching bedrock as they only encountered sterile orange clay. Cyamakuza is 
a previously published site and is well known for its historical and 
archaeological associations with iron production (Van Grunderbeek et al. 
1983; Van Noten 1983). 
 Nyirankuba (Southing 02.27 and Easting 29.44) was previously found to 
preserve iron slag and Urewe ceramics at the surface (Hiernaux and Maquet 
1960; and Nenquin 1967a). Site survey here recovered two Urewe sherds and 
a 2x1m test-unit was excavated to a depth of 1m before it was abandoned 
because only sterile cultivated soils were encountered in a heavily disturbed 
area. Despite intensive survey in the surrounding hills no other Early Iron 
Age material was recovered. 
6.3 Kabusanze (BPS036)  
Excavations took place at Kabusanze in Huye District, Rwanda from the 17/08/07 to 
31/08/07. The site is located at southing 02.30.32.3, easting 029.41.40.6 with an 
elevation of 1751m. The site was originally identified during survey by the 
occurrence of a thin scatter of Urewe pottery and small blocks of iron slag across the 
hilltop and was assigned the code BPS036. Upon our return to the site during the 
second fieldwork season a concentration of Urewe pottery was found and two test-
units, A and B, were located over it (Fig. 6.10). Units A and B began as 2x1m trenches 
but during the course of the excavations both were extended and completed as 3x2m 
test units. Unit A was extended twice so that a number of pit features could be better 
exposed and excavated. Unit B was extended to try to expose any potential 
neighbouring archaeology in an otherwise barren area. Despite the unit B extensions, 
no significant archaeological remains were encountered except a shallow mixed 
cultivation layer at the surface that contained both Early Iron Age Urewe ceramics 
and Late Iron Age roulette-decorated ceramics. Beneath this deposit at 0.2m a more 
compacted, sterile, reddish-brown, clayey deposit was encountered (Fig. 6.11). 
Excavations proceeded into this sterile layer to ascertain its nature and to find a 
secure natural deposit. The excavations were also extended to the east to remove the 
mixed surface deposit and reveal any archaeological features cut into the clay. The 
extensions revealed no archaeological deposits and natural gravels were 
encountered in unit B at a depth of 1.9m. Due to the lack of any significant 
archaeology in unit B, and its extensions, it was abandoned and work continued at 
unit A where a variety of significant features were identified.

Fig. 6.11 Illustration showing the south facing section of test-excavation unit B at Kabusanze  
The excavations at unit A were extended to the east and west to further expose two 
pits with Urewe pottery (Fig. 6.12) and a burial with Urewe pottery, a partially 
represented adult skeleton and a neonate skeleton, iron objects, bone beads, a cowrie 
shell and charcoal. The burial was of particular importance. Only one other Urewe 
burial has ever been reported in the region (Misago & Shumbusho 1992) and whilst 
most of the elements were similar (Misago pers. comms. 2007) the presence of a 
cowrie shell is the first evidence of long distance exchange in an Early Iron Age 
central African context. The recovery of iron objects also presents a rare opportunity 
to analyse the end product of the early iron-production process instead of simply the 
waste products (the results of the burial excavation are discussed separately in this 
section and are contextualised separately in Chapter 9). Ceramic analysis of the 
recovered assemblage from unit A suggests that this is an Urewe ceramic using site. 
Beneath the modern surface disturbance the assemblage was exclusively confined to 
Urewe ceramic diagnostic features such as bevelled rims, incised decoration and 
restricted fabric types, which suggests that this can be treated as a single component 
site. This is supported by the three radiocarbon dates recovered (Fig. 6.13), one from 
each of the pit features that are broadly consistent and place the activities at this site 
within the middle phase of Urewe using communities in Rwanda.

The first context encountered in unit A was a mixed, cultivated, surface soil 
containing both Urewe and roulette-decorated pottery. Beneath this, cut into the 
surrounding sterile clayey-silt, was a large pit feature that had been truncated by the 
cultivation above. This pit fill contained occasional Urewe pottery, rare and 
fragmentary poorly preserved bone, occasional bone beads and charcoal. The cut 
associated with this feature truncated the small pit and the burial pit beneath. The 
relationship between the small pit and the large pit above can be seen in section. 
Unfortunately the relationship between these pits and the burial was not clearly 
preserved in section and was destroyed during excavation as the large pit was 
excavated.  
The burial was only identified during the later stages of the excavation after the 
large pit had been removed and the excavations began to reach the natural gravels. 
Like the small pit, the burial was most easily identified as a feature cut into the 
natural gravel. The fill of the burial pit was very distinct, being very fine, well-
sorted, reddish brown, with green lenses, soft clayey-silt. The feature was only 
identified as a burial as excavations proceeded to reveal two partially preserved/ 
represented skeletons and grave goods. Due to issues with the local community and 
the potential for vandalism the grave had to be excavated within a singe day because 
the exposure of a human burial of any antiquity in post-genocide Rwanda is 
problematic.  
The skeleton and grave goods were exposed then planned in-situ and photographed 
before being carefully removed. The burial produced four iron objects, bone beads, 
one fragment of a cowry shell, a small complete Urewe vessel along with a number 
of almost complete much larger Urewe vessels (these are described in detail in 
section 6.7). 
6.4 Ceramic Analysis  
Following the methodology set out in Chapter 5, the analysis of the ceramic 
assemblage was separated by technology and morphology.  
Technological Profile 
Seven fabric types were identified within the assemblage from the three pit features 
encountered at Kabusanze unit A, B1  B7. The prefix here refers to Butare the local 
administrative centre and is the prefix for all nomenclature in the southern region. 
The properties for each fabric are listed below (Fig. 6.14): 
Fabric Physical properties and effect Decoration  Attribution 
B1 Dark reddish-black, unoxidised firing, soft fine grained 
matrix, smooth texture, medium angular quartz inclusions 
(<5%) 1-5mm, sub-angular mica inclusions (<5%) <1mm. 
Incised  Urewe 
B2 Grey, oxidised firing, smooth texture, rare angular mica, 
quartz and grog inclusions (<5%) <2mm 
None Unknown 
B3 Reddish brown, oxidised firing, regular sub-angular grog 
inclusions (10%) <5mm, rare angular quartz and mica 
(<5%) <5mm.

(<5%) 3-5mm, with oxidised firing 
None Unknown 
Fig. 6.14 Table showing Kabusanze fabric categories 
The total weight of sherds identified to fabric group from the three pit features came 
to 7.85kg. Whilst seven fabric groups were identified within this, the identified 
assemblage was dominated by B1 (83%), with B2 (6%) the next most frequent, 
followed by B6 (5%) with the remaining four fabric groups making up the difference 
(6%). This dominance by B1 is repeated when the assemblage from the large pit is 
considered separately (Fig. 6.15): 
Fabric Weight kg % 
B1 2.760 69.96 
B2 0.425 11.45 
B3 0.005 0.12 
B4 0.150 3.8 
B5 0.210 5.32 
B6 0.365 9.25 
B7 0.030 0.76 
Total 3945 100 
Fig. 6.15 Table showing fabric weights and percentages for the large pit, Kabusanze  
In the assemblage from the burial pit (2.83kg) B1 is dominant, accounting for 99.46% 
with B7 making up the remaining 0.54%, and B1 was the only fabric group recovered 
from the small pit ceramic assemblage (0.35kg).  
The ceramic assemblage from Kabusanze suggests a strong preference for a single 
fabric type, and thus a single potential clay source. This can be seen especially clearly 
when deliberate interment is involved as in the burial. However, the analysis shows 
that there is room for variation, experimentation and/or choice as demonstrated by 
B2 and B6, but it must be noted that some of these fabric groups have been assigned 
on the basis of very few sherds, such as B3 and B7, and these may not represent 
separate fabric groups but anomalies or idiosyncrasies in the other better 
represented fabric groups. 
Morphological Profile 
Sixty-two reconstructable vessels were recovered from the total assemblage from 
unit A. Three major vessel forms dominated this assemblage: globular everted neck 
jars (36.06%) (Fig. 6.16), open bowls (21.31%) (Fig. 6.17) and hemispherical bowls 
(18.03%) (Figs. 6.18 and 6.19) and to a lesser degree: flared mouth bowls (9.83%), 
shouldered closed bowls (8.19%), closed bowls (4.91%) (Fig. 6.20), beakers (1.63%) 
and closed jars (1.63%). This ratio is in contrast to Leakey et als (1948) Urewe 
typology and Ashleys (2005) work from the northern shores of Lake Victoria, and 
with Van Grunderbeeks (1988) 60:40 ratio of jars to bowls from Rwanda. However, 
the vessel range is consistent across all these studies.

Fig. 6.23 Graph showing the range and frequency of reconstructable vessel openings, Kabusanze 
Combining the form distribution with the fabric groupings (Figs. 6.21 and 6.22) 
shows the prevalence of the B1 fabric group in all of the forms represented which 
continues to suggest that this fabric was most available, effective or preferred. The 
vessel opening diameter range (Fig. 6.23) shows that whilst openings enjoyed a 
broad range from 8cm to 40cm, they were most commonly 15-25cm, accounting for 
approximately 50% of all reconstructable vessels.    
As might be expected from an Early Iron Age assemblage, bevelled rims (88%) 
dominate the total assemblage from the three pit features at Kabusanze, with simple 
rounded (8%) and squared rims (4%) making up the difference (Fig. 6.24). However, 
following Ashley (2005: 172), the rim categories have been sub-divided into simple 
and complex, based on the presumed effort expended during their production, 
allowing a more nuanced pattern to be elucidated. Ashley (2005: 173) separated 
simple bevelled rims (2 bevels), which require only a basic technique of thumb and 
forefinger to be produced, from the more complex multi-faceted bevelled rims (3 or 
more) in order to give a more textured picture of variability for the three main 
vessel types.

Fig. 6.24 Table showing rim complexity combined with vessel form, Kabusanze  
When this approach is applied to the results from Kabusanze (Fig. 6.24) it suggests 
that a much higher investment of time was spent on the jars than on the other vessels 
with the least investment spent on the open bowls. The distribution presented in this 
table suggests a much greater degree of standardization in jars, where rims are 
always bevelled, than seen in the other vessel types. This is directly opposite to 
Ashleys (2005: 170-175) findings where jars favour the less complex options.

Fig. 6.25 Table showing distribution of decoration relative to vessel form, Kabusanze  
The frequency and distribution of decorative styles relative to form show some clear 
preferences (Fig. 6.25). Again in this assemblage jars consistently receive the most 
decorative attention with 97% of examples being decorated as opposed to only 31% 
of open bowls, and jars demonstrate the most variety of decorative styles. There is 
also a clear preference for cross-hatching in jar decoration (62%), with this style not 
seen on either of the other form types. Whilst there is a more even distribution of 
decoration across the hemispherical bowl types, the open bowls again show the least 
effort invested with the majority only displaying simple horizontal incisions (23%). 
Whilst this again mirrors the level of investment in rim relative to form it again is in 
contrast to Ashleys (2005) findings.  
The position of decoration appears to be broadly evenly distributed over the vessel 
areas, with the exception of the interior and bases where there is no decoration 
recorded (Fig. 6.26). The only observable preference is the relatively high incidence 
of decoration on the necks of the jars. The differences observed between decorative 
locations on the bowls are not believed to be significant here due to the relatively 
small sample, which included only five decorated open bowls and ten hemispherical 
bowls.

Comments  
The majority of this assemblage appears to have been produced from a single clay 
source by a community of specialists sharing similar ceramic standards. This is 
implied by the overwhelming dominance and consistency of fabric group B1 and the 
stability in form relative to decorative investment seen in the jars. Most significant in 
this assemblage is the direct relationship observed in effort investment during 
forming production and decorative application. The jars are the largest and most 
elementally complex of the three main forms represented, they have the highest 
incidence of complex rims applied, and are the most frequently decorated of all the 
forms, suggesting an important social role, perhaps above that of the open and 
hemispherical bowls.   
6.5 Zooarchaeological Analysis  
There were no zooarchaeological remains recovered during the excavations at 
Kabusanze. Zooarchaeological remains are rare from Early Iron Age sites in 
Southern Rwanda despite this region receiving the greatest archaeological attention. 
The only Early Iron Age zooarchaeological sample that has been recovered is a 
single cattle tooth, excavated by Van Grunderbeek (1981) and identified by Gautier, 
which was radiocarbon dated by association with a related furnace feature to the 4th 
century AD. Despite being broadly supported by the linguistic evidence (e.g. 
Schoenbrun 1998, discussed in Chapter 4 section 4.8), this find remains 
archaeologically isolated and potentially unreliable, being found so close to the 
surface, in an insecure context and not having been directly dated.  
It is disappointing that Kabusanze did not preserve any zooarchaeological remains, 
as it restricts investigation into subsistence economy in the Early Iron Age in 
southern Rwanda. However, Kabusanze did reveal interesting empirical evidence of 
plant exploitation during this early period. 
7.6 Palaeobotanical Analysis 
Palaeobotanical samples were taken from each of the three pit features in unit A at 
Kabusanze. Analysis of the soil sample from the large pit identified two sorghum 
(Sorghum bicolour) charred seeds, and one polygonaceae (a wild flowering plant) and 
three vigna seeds (a wild legume). Analysis of the soil sample from the burial fill 
revealed one fragment of charred polygonaceae seed found in the fill above the body. 
Analysis of the soil sample in the small pit feature cut into the gravel identified a 
charred pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) fragment. The relatively small size of the 
palaeobotanical sample prohibits the statistical analysis of these finds and the 
generation of any secondary data. However, these finds make an important 
empirical contribution. These remains represent some of the earliest recovered 
cultivated domestic grains from eastern and central Africa and they are especially 
important as they have been found in association with secure archaeological features 
and are not simply from general archaeological deposits. The sample taken from the 
small pit is more significant because it came from an extremely well defined feature 
encountered at 2m depth, cut into the natural gravels and clay and thus is very 
secure with limited chance of contamination.  
7.7 Burial  
The burial contained two skeletons, a range of Urewe vessels and associated grave 
goods (Figs. 6.27 and 6.28) and these are described in detail below.

approximately 1.5 in diameter)

including the whole small pot, mandible and axis and broken Classic Urewe vessels 
Human Remains 
The human bones from the burial at Kabusanze were analysed by Dr Anna Clement 
at the Institute of Archaeology, University College London. The details of her 
analysis are included in Appendix 1 and they are summarised here. 
There were two skeletons excavated from the burial at Kabusanze, an adult skeleton 
and a neonate skeleton. The adult skeleton was encountered within the burial pit cut 
into the underlying gravels, the neonate skeleton was encountered approximately 
0.5m above the adult skeleton in the fill of the burial shaft. The large Urewe pit 
truncated the burial shaft above. Charcoal was encountered around the adult 
skeleton and a sample of this, found in association with the adult skeleton, was 
radiocarbon dated to c.400 AD, as were all the samples from Kabusanze (Fig. 6.13).  
The adult skeleton was only partially represented with only parts of the upper 
skeleton present, including cranial and limited post-cranial elements: a cut mandible 
and maxilla (Figs. 6.29 and 6.30); and rib fragments, vertebrae, including the axis and 
the atlas, and the distal end and partial shaft of the right humerus, showed cut 
marks and a post-mortem fracture (Fig. 6.31).

Clement (UCL))

beneath (courtesy of Dr Anna Clement (UCL)) 
Fig. 6.31 Photograph showing adult humerus from Kabusanze  (courtesy of Dr Anna Clement (UCL)) 
In the absence of the pelvis and sufficient comparative dental data it was not 
possible to estimate the age of the adult skeleton at death to a high degree of 
precision. However, all of the teeth were fully erupted and were in wear suggesting 
that the individual was anatomically mature. The lack of a pelvis also hampered the 
attribution of a sex to the skeleton. Instead the mandible was analysed as an 
indicator of sex. Based on the size and robustness of the mandible the adult is 
considered to be a male.  
The dentition not only preserved age evidence but also pathologies suffered by the 
adult. For example, the upper right incisor is present but rotted through the centre 
resulting in a large abscess at the apex of the root (Fig. 6.32), the lower left molar 
appears to have been lost due to a large abscess in the alveolar bone and several of 
the teeth show evidence of caries (dental decay) and infection, some of which has 
been suggested relates to poor nutrition in childhood.  
Fig. 6.32 Photograph showing upper dentition from adult skeleton at Kabusanze, including rotten 
incisor and abscess (courtesy of Dr Anna Clement (UCL)) 
The lack of the remaining post-cranial skeleton is not believed to be from secondary 
burial or disturbance in situ. The burial was interred with a range of burial goods, in 
a deep burial pit, and was sealed above by an Early Iron Age pit dated to the same 
period. It is also not thought to be a preservation issue because the most robust post-
cranial bones are totally absent whilst the ribs are preserved. Furthermore the cranial 
bones are very well preserved and localised preservation conditions within the pit 
could not have created these anomalies. Thus, it is believed that only select elements 
were interred, a suggestion which is supported by the cut marks on the mandible 
and humerus that indicate defleshing and decapitation, either at the time of death or 
post-mortem. 
The neonate skeleton was well preserved and included most of the skeleton (Fig. 
6.33). The age-at-death of the skeleton, based on the measurement of the petrous 
bone, tympanic ring and the long bones, is suggested to be around the time of birth, 
although it is possible that the neonate survived into the first few weeks of life. 
Unfortunately it is not possible to estimate a sex for the neonate because anatomical 
sex related changes do not occur until adolescence.

(UCL)) 
Burial Pots 
Although the ceramics from the burial have already been presented as part of the 
total assemblage analysis for the site, it is believed that they may be fruitfully 
analysed separately and that such analysis can be expected to produce socially 
meaningful results because these archaeological ceramics are the product of 
deliberate deposition, in a socially meaningful context.  
The dominance of fabric B1 in the technological profile is again seen in the burial, 
accounting for ten out of the eleven reconstructable vessels, the only other fabric 
represented is B7. This represents a clear selection preference for the interred 
ceramics, B1 being the finest of all the fabrics. The morphological profile of the burial 
ceramics is varied and whilst jars are again in the highest frequency (four vessels) 
(Figs. 6.34 and 6.35) they are not overwhelmingly dominant as in the total 
assemblage. The remaining burial assemblage is made up of two shouldered collared 
bowls, two flared mouth bowls (Fig 6.36), one open bowl and one hemispherical 
bowl (Fig 6.37). There is also a small complete closed bowl (Fig 6.38). It is tempting 
to think of this as an almost complete ceramic set or crockery set used during the 
life of the deceased, although this of course is speculative. The rim types of the 
vessels are all bevelled, two examples - a jar and an open bowl display simple 
bevelled rims (2 bevels) and the remainder have complex bevelled rims (3-4 bevels). 
All of the vessels in the burial pit were decorated except for the open bowl, the jars 
had four incidents of incised cross-hatching, one incised circular motif, and one 
incised oblique application, the shouldered collared bowls both had incised circular 
motifs, the flared mouth bowls were incised with cross hatchings, and the 
hemispherical bowl was horizontally incised. These applications appear to be 
broadly consistent with those presented for the total assemblage and thus appear to 
be related to the forms selected for interment and are not of particular relevance to 
the burial. In summary, it seems that a complete range of forms, in the most common 
and finest fabric, were selected for interment as grave goods within the burial.

Other Burial Goods 
Within the burial were also found a cowrie shell (Fig. 6.39), a quartz flake, four metal 
objects and shell beads. The cowrie shell is of particular significance because it 
occurs in an Early Iron Age context and must have been transported to central Africa 
from the coast because it is a salt-water mollusc. (The significance of this potential 
Early Iron Age long distance exchange artefact in Great Lakes Africa will be 
discussed in detail in Chapter 9). 
Fig. 6.39 Photograph showing cowrie shell recovered from the burial at Kabusanze 
The quartz flake (Fig. 6.40) was the only lithic found in the excavated assemblage 
from all of the features at Kabusanze despite quartz occurring naturally in the 
vicinity. Thus, although it is possible that the flake is an incidental inclusion it is 
suggested here to be a deliberate inclusion alongside all the other grave artefacts 
were. Unfortunately, as is common with quartz, the flake shows only potential 
evidence of working and has little interpretative value without other comparative 
material. However, it does demonstrate that the Urewe users at Kabusanze still 
possessed lithic tools, although their otherwise absence at the site suggests this was 
no-longer common practice.  
Fig. 6.40 Photograph showing quartz flake recovered from the burial fill at Kabusanze 
Five white shell beads (Fig. 6.41) were recovered from the burial fill. These were of 
two sizes with a 0.9mm or 0.5mm total diameter, and a 0.15mm perforation in the 
centre. Shell beads are common in African archaeological contexts throughout the 
Iron Age and thus their occurrence is not unusual and offers little further insight into 
the context of the burial. However, the beads are another example of adornment, 
alongside the iron objects (discussed below), and cowrie shell, that have been 
interred with these individuals and continue to suggest a human symbolic 
attachment to items of material culture at this time.   
Fig. 6.41 Photograph showing four shell beads recovered from the burial fill at Kabusanze. 
Finally, the four iron objects (Fig. 6.42) present a rare opportunity to study the end 
products of the iron working process in an Early Iron Age context. Two of the objects 
are shaped like a bracelet whilst another appears to be a necklet. The fourth is highly 
fragmentary but was a thin disc-shaped object with a small hole in the middle. The 
iron artefacts were x-rayed to show the iron to corrosion ratio (Fig. 6.43) and three 
had enough iron present for small samples to be taken for SEM-EDS analysis to gain 
further insights into early iron production in the region, which has been carried out 
by Jane Humphries on two of the objects (see Appendix 2 for the specialist report).

The archaeometallurgical analysis carried out by Jane Humphris revealed that the 
bracelet and necklet were square in section and must have been hammered on four 
sides to achieve this, indicating a high degree of smithing skill. The results of the 
iron analysis are characteristic of bloomery iron production, suggesting that 
bloomery smelting, and primary forging techniques, were known to Urewe users. 
Humphris concludes that one or more smiths with a high degree of technical 
knowledge made these objects. These 1st millennium AD metallurgists were capable 
of shaping iron into long thin strands and forming them into symmetrical circles, 
and in one case producing a flat disc with a concentric hole, that Humphris believes 
would have been a difficult shape to achieve. 
7.8 Summary  
The two fieldwork seasons in the southern survey zone were very successful. The 
survey managed to identify over 52 Iron Age sites and re-located 9 previously 
published sites. This survey has demonstrated the potential for new and extant 
archaeological resources to survive in this densely populated and cultivated 
landscape. Whilst the interpretative potential of the survey results is limited they 
suggest that site location did not shift between the 1st and 2nd millennium AD. 
Instead there is an increase in visibility of Late Iron Age sites and these begin to 
appear down slope in lower altitudes, perhaps due to an increase in population 
resulting in greater pressures on land, or due to the availability of new land resulting 
from vegetation clearance and drainage of the valleys. 
Unfortunately test excavation at a range of sites was unsuccessful, demonstrating 
that site identification based on surface finds is a poor indicator of sub-surface 
remains. However, by testing a range of sites the excavations encountered rich 
archaeological contexts at Kabusanze (BPS036). This site produced a wealth of 
Classic Urewe ceramics and three archaeological features all dating to c.400AD. 
Within the two pit features were identified charred palaeobotanical remains that 
represent the earliest domestic macro-remains for cultivated cereals in Rwanda and 
the region. Finally of considerable significance is the burial identified at Kabusanze 
that presents a rarely seen window into the socio-political context of Urewe users. 
Initial interpretation suggests that a complex burial event took place involving two 
skeletons, adult and neonate, a range of specialist materials including Urewe vessels 
and metal adornments, alongside beads, a quartz flake and a long distance trade 
artefact, a cowrie shell.  
The most salient of these results will be returned to in Chapter 9 (section 9.1-13) 
when they will be contextualised within the other 1st millennium AD results from 
this research described in Chapters 7 and 8.

Research Findings from the Central Rwanda: 
 Case Study 2 
This chapter presents the results from the systematic survey and excavations in the 
central study zone. It will first briefly discuss the survey results before describing in 
detail the excavations at Karama (GPS014).  
7.1 Central Survey Results 
Fig. 7.1 Map showing the central survey zone (15km x 15km), outlined by bold black line. The bold red 
lines indicate roads whilst the thinner red lines are tracks and paths (reproduced and adapted with 
permission from CGIS Rwanda) 
The survey in the central study zone was undertaken over two months from 
November 2006 to January 2007. The main administrative centre in this area was 
Gitarama (Fig. 2.1) (now called Ruhango) and all new sites identified were given a 
Gitarama Pragmatic Survey (GPS) number. In the central study zone (Fig. 7.1) forty-
three new sites were identified along with one previously published site, 
Rugobagoba (Fig. 7.2) (Hiernaux and Maquet 1960; Nenquin 1967a; Van Noten 
1983). The sites identified here represent a dramatic increase in our knowledge of 
this region. Only two sites, Ruli and Rugobagaoba, have previously been identified 
close to this area (Nenquin 1967a) and only Ruli has been excavated, with 
Rugobagoba being identified based on a small surface assemblage.   
Fig. 7.2 Satellite Image showing total central survey zone site distribution 
The landscape in central Rwanda is extremely dramatic and the aspect increases 
sharply compared to the southern survey zone. Many of the hill slopes in this region 
are not traversable and winding paths and roads navigate around them. To the north 
of the central survey zone is the River Nyabarongo, at approximately 1370m above 
sea level, and to the west are a ridge of hills and mountains that climb to 1950m 
above sea level alongside the River Gasaza. The severity of aspect and altitude 
decrease to the east where the average hill altitude is approximately 1700m above 
sea level. As in the south, survey sites are broadly distributed across the zone, and 
with the exception of GPS031, are not found in the lowest or wettest areas. However, 
unlike the southern survey zone sites are often not located within easy reach of 
rivers and are not located near the highest altitudes.   
Fig. 7.3 Satellite Image showing central survey zone Urewe site distribution. 
The central survey identified five new archaeological sites with Early Iron Age 
material and one previously published site, Rugobagoba (Hiernaux and Maquet 
1960; Nenquin 1967a) (Fig. 7.3). Only one site, Karama (GPS014), was found without 
iron production remains and with the exception of GPS025, all the Early Iron Age 
sites are located to the south in a drier less riverine area, and again there is a 
preference for hilltops. The survey identified thirty-eight new sites with Late Iron 
Age material and one previously published site, Rugobagoba (Hiernaux and Maquet 
1960; Nenquin 1967a). Of these sites, sixteen contained twisted-string roulette-
decorated ceramics (Fig. 7.4); thirty-six contained knotted-strip roulette-decorated 
ceramics (Fig. 7.5) and thirteen contained both. Again only site, Karama (GPS014), 
was found without metalworking remains and, as in the Early Iron Age, Late Iron 
Age sites were located away from the major rivers with a preference for the lower 
altitude area to the east away from the high ridge to the west. However, as in the 
southern zone, the site elevation graphs (Figs. 7.6 and 7.7) suggest that during the 
Late Iron Age a greater range of elevations were utilised than in the Early Iron Age.

roulette-decorated (KPR) sites 
Only two sites had previously been identified in the central zone, Rugobagba and 
Ruli, and attempts were made to re-locate both of these. Rugobagoba was reported 
to have both Urewe and Late Iron Age roulette-decorated wares and this site was 
easily found because it was located close to a historic building (Hiernaux and 
Maquet 1960: 66). However, intensive survey around this area only revealed a thin 
surface scatter of twisted-string roulette-decorated pottery in an area heavily 
disturbed by cultivation and construction on a heavily eroded hilltop with bedrock 
clearly exposed at the surface.  The second site, Ruli, was reported by Hiernaux and 
Maquet (1960: 12-16) and Nenquin (1967a: 278) to preserve Late Iron Age burials and 
pits, and therefore based on the published data was a prime location for re-
excavation. However, whilst the general area was relocated and substantial amounts 
of Late Iron Age roulette-decorated pottery was recovered, the location of the 
original excavations could not be identified. 
Discussion and Interpretation 
The central survey has resulted in a massive increase in the number of sites known 
for this region. Rugobagoba has been re-identified and forty-three new sites have 
been identified. The subtle shift in site location and the increase in site density 
between the Early Iron Age and Late Iron Age sites match the southern results. This 
is not unsurprising as the central zone has a broadly similar aspect and environment 
to the southern zone and both were core geographic components in the political 
development of Rwanda in the 2nd millennium AD. Southern Rwanda is known for 
its historical importance in iron production, supplying the kingdom with the means 
to propagate the land, to protect the people and to subjugate neighbouring peoples, 
whilst central Rwanda was the political and historical centre of the Rwandan 
kingdom (Vansina 2004: 111). The only noticeable difference between the two zones 
is the utilisation of less riverine environments. However, this appears to be related to 
the geographic characteristics of the landscape. 
7.2 Central Excavation Results 
In the central zone excavations were undertaken at one site, Karama (GPS014). This 
decision was based on the findings of the more extensive test excavation strategy in 
the southern study zone that led the study to focus on known deposits (Chapter 6 
section 6.1). The excavation results from the south suggested that many of the sites 
identified primarily on surface scatters situated on hilltops were likely to be 
indicative of high erosion, low-deposition processes that had left these finds 
exposed, thus hindering the potential for sub-surface archaeological deposits. Taking 
these findings into consideration, and in the absence of any suitable previously 
published sites the survey data from the central zone was carefully scrutinized to 
identify sites with the greatest potential for the preservation of sub-surface 
archaeological deposits. Unfortunately, most of the survey sites from the central 
zone were found in areas associated with similarly poor deposition and high erosion 
such as hilltops and steep slopes, or were established on the basis of thin surface 
scatters. Of those that did preserve known archaeological deposits many were ruled 
out as the prominent remains were of iron working in the form of furnace bases, 
large slag piles and iron-ore mines, which are not a major focus of this research. 
Within this criteria only one site Karama (GPS014) was considered suitable for 
excavation. 
7.3 Karama (GPS014) 
The site at Karama, Kamonyi District, Rwanda was identified by survey during the 
primary fieldwork season and excavations took place between 30/07/07 to 
10/08/07. The site is located at southing 01.57.14.4, easting 029.50.19.3 and at 
elevation 1727m and has been give the site code GPS014. A local man who 
recognised unusual ceramics in a road when it was constructed in the 1960s brought 
the site to our attention. A section of the road cut revealed an archaeological horizon 
containing Late Iron Age roulette-decorated ceramics and faunal remains, and Early 
Iron Age Urewe ceramics were found on the road surface below. Two test units were 
excavated above the road, units A and B (Fig. 7.8), in an attempt to encounter the 
archaeological horizon seen in section.  
Fig. 7.8 Illustration showing site plan of Karama (GPS014) and location of test units A and B  
Fig. 7.9 Illustration showing the south facing section of unit A, Karama  
Test excavation units A and B began as 1x2m trenches but unit A was extended to 
the north to further expose an archaeological pit feature that was identified during 
the initial excavations (Fig. 7.9). The most recent deposit encountered during the unit 
A excavations was greyish-brown, sandy topsoil that had been heavily disturbed by 
cultivation. This deposit contained rare animal bones and twisted-string roulette-
decorated ceramics mixed with incised ceramics. Beneath this topsoil was a more 
compact bluish-black, sandy-silt, subsoil deposit that had also received some 
disturbance but to a lesser degree. The finds from the subsoil were similar to those 
from the topsoil, including both types of ceramic and rare zooarchaeological 
remains, but also containing small pieces of iron slag. There were no soil samples 
taken from either of these deposits due to the high probability of disturbance and 
contamination. Beneath the soils cut into the sterile natural gravel and clay was 
identified a deep conical-shaped pit feature. The pit fill contained an orangey-brown 
silty-clay matrix with occasional charcoal, pottery and animal bones, alongside small 
to medium sub-angular stones. The pit fill appeared to represent multiple tips of 
domestic waste mixed with other material. However, these tips were not distinct 
enough to allow separate excavation, although it was attempted. The fill did not 
contain any roulette-decorated pottery but did contain a range of incised, fingernail 
impressed and punctate decorated wares. Zooarchaeological material was also 
recovered from this deposit along with charcoal for dating and a soil sample for 
palaeobotanical analysis. Beneath the pit sterile natural deposits were reached and 
the unit was discontinued. Radiocarbon analysis was carried out on the charcoal 
from the conical pit because of the importance of the recovered ceramic finds and 
zooarchaeological material, and one date was generated (Fig. 7.10): 
Sample No. Context Date BP Calibrated date (2 sigma)

Fig 7.10 Table showing the radiocarbon date for the conical pit, Karama  
Unit B was positioned down slope, 5m to the east of unit A and during excavation 
was found to contain a series of sands and silts above a shallow cut feature (Fig. 
7.11). Whilst the upper deposits of unit B resemble closely the topsoil and subsoil of 
unit A, those beneath are quite different. The most recent deposit in unit B was 
greyish-brown sandy topsoil containing twisted-string roulette-decorated ceramics 
and rare charcoal, which sat above a more compact blackish-blue sandy silt subsoil 
containing similar finds. Beneath these soil deposits was a series of compact sand 
and silt layers with frequent ceramics and occasional animal bone. These deposits sat 
above a shallow feature cut into the natural clays. This feature continued beneath the 
west facing section but it was not possible to extend the unit to follow it due to time 
constraints. This feature contained traces of charcoal, incised ceramics and a 
vertebra. Unfortunately, there was not enough charcoal within the fill to warrant 
recovering a 14C sample, however, a soil sample was taken.   
Fig. 7.11 Illustration showing the west facing section of unit B, Karama  
7.4 Ceramic Analysis 
The ceramics from Karama have been analysed at a range of scales including total 
site assemblage, total unit assemblages and by individual contexts. The ceramics 
from Karama fall into two generalised groupings, Late Iron Age roulette-decorated 
ceramics and an earlier incised and impressed ware, stylistically distinct from 
Classic Urewe despite sharing certain similarities. Following the methodology set 
out in Chapter 5, the ceramic analysis will be divided into technological and 
morphological profiles. The ceramic assemblage from Karama whilst limited is 
important as aside from the roulette-decorated ceramics the assemblage does not fit 
into the established Early Iron Age/ Late Iron Age typology for the region and, 
based on the radiocarbon date, this assemblage falls into the late Urewe to terminal 
1st millennium AD hiatus, a poorly represented period of Great Lakes Africa history 
(discussed in Chapter 4 sections 4.2-4). Therefore the ceramic analysis questions for 
Karama will focus on defining this potentially new ceramic manifestation and 
considering its possible relations within Rwanda and the wider region.  
Technological Profile 
Within the Karama assemblage fourteen different fabric types were identified G1-
G14. The prefix here refers to Gitarama, the local administrative centre, and is the 
prefix for all nomenclature in the central region. The properties for each fabric are

Fig. 7.12 Table showing the fabric groups from Karama  
The total weight of the analysed assemblage (total assemblage  sherds <2cm) from 
unit A and B at Karama came to 8.431kg. Due to the high fracture rate in this 
assemblage, which complicated fabric definition, 21% of the assemblage could not be 
confidently assigned to a fabric grouping and was treated as miscellaneous. The 
remaining assemblage was divided into 14 fabric groups G1 (25%), G2 (18%), G3 
(18%), G4 (10%) and G12 (4%), with the remaining nine fabric groups making up the 
last 4% (0.351kg). 
A similar percentage distribution was found in the assemblage from unit A when it 
was analysed separately, after the miscellaneous group (12%) the assemblage was 
dominated by G1 (29%), G2 (26%), G3 (15%) and G4 (17%), with the remaining 
fabrics G5-G8 accounting for 2% of the total. There was a slight shift in distribution 
in unit B with miscellaneous group accounting for 32%, followed by G3 (21%), G1 
(20%), G2 (10%) and G12 (9%) with the remaining fabrics, including G4, G6, G9, G10, 
G11, G13 and G14, accounting for the final 7%. The pattern is again repeated in the 
conical pit which was made up of fabrics G1 (35%), G2 (21%), G4 (29%) and 
miscellaneous (15%). However, there was more variability in the assemblage from 
the shallow pit which was made up of fabrics G1 (26%), G2 (5%), G3 (7%), G10 (1%), 
G13 (4%), G14 (5%) and miscellaneous (52%). The dominant fabrics from the total 
assemblage, G1, G2, G3 and G4, can be characterised as coarse wares. They are 
irregularly fired, have a wide range of poorly sorted inclusions, and large grain 
sizes. 
Morphological Profile 
Due to the high fracture rate and limited sample size seen in the Karama 
assemblage, only 23 reconstructable vessels were identified. Bowls dominate the 
total assemblage (96%) with only one jar identified. The bowls can be divided into 
beakers (35%), hemispherical bowls (26%), open bowls (21%) and flared mouth 
bowls (14%).  Unfortunately no reconstructable vessels were recovered from the pit 
in unit B (Fig. 7.13), however, seven reconstructable vessels were recovered from the 
conical pit in unit A, including four hemispherical bowls, one open bowl one flared 
mouth bowl and one beaker. Fabrics G1 and G2 dominate the total reconstructable 
assemblage and this is broadly consistent with the technological profile. Unlike the 
Classic Urewe assemblage from Kabusanze, the rims from Karama show no 
bevelling and are almost totally confined to the simple rounded type (96%), with 
only one example of a beaded rim (4%).

Fig. 7.15 Table showing distribution of forms relative to fabrics, Karama  
Fig. 7.16 Graph showing reconstructable vessel opening diameters for the conical pit, Karama  
Because there were no reconstructable vessels from the shallow pit and only seven 
from the conical pit, the vessel opening diameters may be of limited value (Fig 7.16). 
However, if it is compared to the assemblage already analysed from Kabusanze 
(Chapter 6, section 6.4) it shows a similar distribution from 14-23cm, although none 
of the large (e.g. 40cm) or smaller (e.g. 8cm) vessels are present. The absence of the 
largest and smallest types is believed to be of limited significance, reflecting the lack 
of jars and high percentage of bowls in this assemblage.   
The small size of the total reconstructable sample from Karama prevents a detailed 
statistical analysis of the morphological profile. Nonetheless, the ceramic assemblage 
from Karama is extremely important based on its empirical value in terms of the 
range of decorative styles in the incised/impressed group, which do not fit into the 
accepted typologies for either the Early or late Iron Ages.  
There were 161 decorated sherds recovered from the total assemblage and these 
included six decorative styles: incision (41%), twisted-string roulette-decorated 
(30%), finer nail impressed (20%), punctate (4%), knotted-strip roulette-decorated 
(4%) and stab drag (1%). However, when the disturbed surface deposits are removed 
from the analysis the roulette styles are no longer represented. For example the 
conical pit in unit A contained 21 decorated sherds: 12 incised (7.14, g), 7 fingernail 
impressed (Fig. 7.14, c) and 2 punctate (Fig. 7.14, h) and the small pit in unit B 
contained 11 decorated sherds: 7 incised (Fig. 7.14, d and e), 2 fingernail impressed 
and 2 punctate (Fig. 7.14, c). Unfortunately, a consideration of decoration relative to 
the reconstructable vessel forms is of limited value here due to the small size of the 
decorated reconstructable sample, 11 vessels out of a total of 23.  
Clearly, the ceramic assemblage from Karama displays a wide variety of decorative 
styles (Figs. 7.15, 7.17 and 7.18 for more examples). However, whilst the familiar Late 
Iron Age roulette styles exist within the assemblage they are not present in the 
earliest deposits and are only represented in those contexts believed to have been 
subject to regular disturbance through cultivation. This suggests that at least two 
separate ceramic phases are represented at Karama, the first an incised phase and 
the second, a roulette-decorated one.  Due to the disturbance associated with the 
later phase the focus here has been on the earlier incised/impressed Karama pottery. 
The incised/impressed ceramics in the earliest phases of the site are most similar to 
Early Iron Age Urewe ceramics and are quite distinct from the roulette-decorated 
ceramics that dominate the Late Iron Age in this region. However, they are not the 
same as Urewe. Whilst similar vertical incisions, incised cross-hatching and incised 
triangular decorative styles do occur, there is a much wider range of much coarser 
fabric types, and it lacks two key diagnostic features, bevelled rims and dimple 
bases. Furthermore the dominant Urewe form type, the jar, is barely represented in 
the assemblage.

identified in Unit A, sub-soil, Karama, including crudely herringbone incised rounded rims (a and b),

fingernail impressed (e). 
Having defined Karama pottery in general, the next stage is to briefly contextualise it 
within the Rwandan and wider Great Lakes Africa ceramic framework. The ceramic 
evidence for the incised/impressed phase from Karama is limited. There are only 
two discrete undisturbed features with this type and the assemblage is highly 
fragmentary with only seven reconstructable vessels identified from these contexts. 
However, this is still a very important assemblage because it does not appear to 
conform to any of the widely accepted ceramic traditions for the region and lies 
within the hiatus period identified in Chapter 4 for the terminal 1st millennium AD. 
Within Rwanda these ceramics most closely resemble incised styles from Bugarama 
in the north and incised C-Ware styles from a range of other sites (e.g. Nenquin 
1967a). Unfortunately these sites are undated and this incised style is combined with 
twisted-string roulette in often poorly stratified assemblages. However, based on the 
date of these ceramics and their potential relationship with earlier Classic Urewe 
ceramics they may also have affinities with Devolved Urewe identified by Ashley 
(2005) and Posnansky (1961b; et al. 2005) in Uganda at a number of sites during this 
terminal phase such as Lutoboka, Sozi and Lolui (see Chapter 4, section 4.4). This 
possibility will be explored in detail in Chapter 9. 
The ceramic analysis from Karama suggests that the earliest deposits encountered 
during excavation represent a separate ceramic phase in the Great Lakes Africa Iron 
Age that falls between the more familiar 1st millennium AD Classic Urewe and the 
2nd millennium AD roulette-decorated ceramic phase. In summary Karama appears 
to contain three successive ceramic phases Classic Urewe, incised Karama Pottery 
(potentially Devolved Urewe), and Late Iron Age roulette-decorated pottery. Whilst 
no Classic Urewe contexts were encountered during excavation, Classic Urewe 
sherds with multiple bevelled rims and incised crosshatching were found down 
slope on the surface.  It is believed that these came from nearby deposits because the 
site is close to the top of a small hill, suggesting that even if they have been 
transported they cannot have been moved far. This suggests a degree of antiquity, 
and continuity, for the occupation of this hilltop, if not the actual site of excavation, 
stretching back into the mid or early 1st millennium AD.  
7.5 Zooarchaeological Analysis 
The zooarchaeological assemblage from Karama is small and it is not believed that it 
can be usefully statistically analysed. However, the assemblage is very significant as 
it provides empirical evidence of domestic species exploited alongside wild species 
in a context dated to c.700AD. Following the methodology set out in Chapter 5 the 
zooarchaeological remains from each context have been analysed separately, 
recording where possible the taxon, element, side, aging evidence, modification and 
the Number of Identified Species (NISP) and Minimum Number of Individuals 
(MNI).  The age estimates of the Bos taurus remains from Karama are based on those 
established by Grant (1978, 1982) and ranges are expressed in months. Where it has 
not been possible to identify bovid remains to species these have been given a size-
based category that reflects an estimate of the size of the individual animal that a 
specimen came from. These are called bovid size classes (1 to 5), five being the 
biggest and one being the smallest. These are subjective categories that help to give a 
more representative description of the non-species attributed assemblage. 
Two hundred and fifty-five zooarchaeological specimens were recovered from the 
excavations at Karama and sixty-three (25%) of these were identified to at least taxon 
and element.  Very few specimens displayed signs of deliberate modification: seven 
had knife-cut marks and one had evidence of sawing. The topsoil from unit A 
contained rare and fragmentary zooarchaeological remains, which prevented 
specimen identification beyond family (Fig. 7.20). All of the identified remains came 
from bovidae with three specimens from bovid size class 5 and two from bovid size 
class 3. The only identified modifications were knife cut marks apparent on a 
thoracic vertical process. There was only one unidentified fragment from this 
context.

In the subsoil of unit A the zooarchaeological sample consisted of four bovid size 
class 5 specimens, two bovid size class 3 specimens, one bovid size class 2 specimen, 
and five cattle (Bos taurus) specimens (Fig. 7.21). Two of the specimens showed 
modification by knife cut marks and one displayed sawing. There were 21 
unidentified fragments from this context.

The zooarchaeological sample from the deep conical shaped pit (7.22) is the most 
significant because it contains both domestic and wild specimens and comes from a 
sealed and dated archaeological feature. Whilst, the pit fill was dominated by 
bovidae, there are also suidae, artiodactyla and carnivora remains. The specimens 
identified to species included six cattle (Bos taurus) specimens, one Gazelle humerus, 
one Great Forest Hog metatarsal and one leopard (Panthera pardus) tail bone. The pit 
fill also contained two specimens of bovid size class 5, four specimens of bovid size 
class 4, and six specimens of bovid size class 3. Only one specimen showed evidence 
of deliberate modification, a cattle femur. There were seventy-five unidentified 
bones from this context.

The zooarchaeological assemblages from the topsoil and subsoil are of little value. 
These contexts reveal little in the way of species information and in the case of the 
topsoil are likely to have been mixed through cultivation and thus may be from 
recent deposition. Furthermore, the occurrence of cattle (Bos taurus) remains in 
contexts with Late Iron Age roulette-decorated pottery is not unexpected because 
cattle are known to be important in this region during the Late Iron Age and 
especially during the Kingdom Era. However, the occurrence of domesticated cattle 
remains in a secure sealed context with wild remains dating to the terminal 1st 
millennium AD is more significant. Whilst it is debatable as to why the leopard 
(Panthera pardus) specimen is present it is possible that both the wild pig (suidae) and 
antilopinae remains were hunted or at least gathered. However, without butchery or 
hunting evidence any such conclusions although probable, remain speculative.  
In unit B at Kabusanze infrequent zooarchaeological remains were again recovered. 
In the topsoil no animal bones were identified to family or species because the ten 
recovered specimens were highly fragmentary. The frequency of finds increased in 
the subsoil (Fig. 7.23) where bovid size class 5 was represented by two specimens 
both with knife cut marks, bovid size class 4 by one specimen and bovid size class 3 
by four specimens. Only three specimens were identified to species, a cattle (Bos 
taurus) second phalange, and a first and second upper molar of age class VII and VIII 
respectively, which indicate individuals that had reached full maturity in life (e.g. 
older than 24 months). There were 29 unidentified fragments from this context.

class 3 specimens, one with a knife cut mark, a single wild pig (suidae) specimen and 
a cattle (Bos taurus) specimen, an upper second pre-molar with an age class of VIII to

Bovidae again dominate the zooarachaeological sample from the silty-sand in unit B 
with one artcodactyl specimen, bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus) (Fig. 7.25). From this 
context bovid size class 5 was represented by one fused distal humerus fragment, 
bovid size class 4 by one cranial vertebrae fragment, bovid size class 2 by one 
fractured femur shaft. A single cow (Bos taurus) specimen was identified, an upper 
third deciduous tooth, which aged the individual to between 0-15months. Twenty-
two fragments recovered from this context remain unidentified.

From the earliest feature in unit B, the shallow pit, only one zooarchaeological 
specimen was recovered, a thoracic vertebra. This specimen was only partially 
preserved and could only be identified to Bovid Size Class 5.  
The total zooarchaeological assemblage recovered from unit B was very similar to 
that from unit A. Both were dominated by bovidae with rare suidae. The majority of 
bovid specimens identified to species belonged to the domestic cattle (Bos Taurus). 
The aging of the cattle bones where possible suggests that a specific kill strategy was 
not employed as a variety of ages at death were identified ranging from immature to 
mature specimens. For example, dental age ranges from 0-15 months right up to the 
oldest ranges (>36 months) were identified and the post-cranial elements were 
present from unfused, just fusing and fully fused specimens. The most significant 
result from the zooarchaeological sample from Karama was the identification of 
domestic remains alongside wild remains in a context dated to the terminal 1st 
millennium AD. However, whilst the presence of domestic cattle species, some with 
knife cut marks, suggests human consumption, the presence of wild specimens at 
the site is not so clear. The wild bovidae and suidae were probably hunted, or 
scavenged, deliberately brought to site, and used as food, but in the absence of 
butchery marks the evidence is not conclusive. It is also difficult to draw any further 
conclusions from this assemblage because it is extremely small. Whilst the total 
Number of Identified Specimens Present (NISP) in the entire assemblage, from both 
unit A and B, is 61, the Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI) present is only 27. 
Furthermore, the MNI could be reduced if the specimens identified to a bovid size 
class were identified to species and were not shown to replicate side-specific 
elements within those species. Furthermore, when analysed by separate context the 
MNI is 1, in all examples. 
The significant results from the zooarchaeological analysis from Karama can be 
summarized as: 
 The identification of domesticated cattle during the mid to terminal 1st 
millennium AD, which continues to support the linguistic evidence for the 
early establishment of herding (Schoenbrun 1998 see Chapter 4 section 4.9). 
 The identification of butchered domestic faunal remains alongside wild 
remains, suggesting that an economic dichotomy between foraging and 
herding cannot be assumed to have existed in Rwanda at this time.   
7.6 Palaeobotanical Analysis   
Three contexts were sampled for palaeobotanical remains at Karama, including the 
subsoil and pit fill from unit A, and the pit fill from unit B. Analysis of the unit A 
subsoil sample revealed two burnt finger millet (Eleusine coracana) seeds and one 
indeterminate fragment. Whilst these specimens are interesting in a Late Iron Age 
context, the potential for mixing through cultivation brings their integrity into 
question. Analysis of the soil sample remains from the conical pit fill revealed one 
burnt finger millet seed and two seed coat fragments, one of which resembled finger 
millet based on its distinctive surface patterning. The shallow pit from unit B 
contained one burnt finger millet seed fragment, three indeterminate fragments and 
one seed coat fragment. Like the zooarchaeological sample, the palaeobotanical 
sample is very small and it is difficult to extrapolate much secondary data from these 
limited remains. However, the identification of finger-millet seeds in the pit fill of 
the conical pit, dated by radiocarbon association to the terminal 1st millennium AD, 
and the presence of a second finger-millet seed in the shallow pit, tentatively dated 
to the same period based on the ceramic typology is highly significant. Despite the 
presumed importance of crops such as sorghum and finger millet in the prehistoric 
sub-Saharan African diet there has been very little direct archaeological evidence 
recovered (Young and Thompson 1999: 63). This is even more surprising for central 
and eastern Africa as the linguistic evidence suggests that finger millet was probably 
domesticated in Northern Uganda (Ehret 1982; Harlaan 1992). Although this limited 
evidence will be questioned, the continued identification of domestic crops at a 
range of sites is developing the argument in Rwanda and elsewhere in Great Lakes 
Africa (e.g. Van Grunderbeek and Roche 2005) that domesticated cereals were being 
cultivated in the 1st millennium AD in Great Lakes Africa.  
7.7 Other Finds  
The small finds from Karama were confined to three iron objects recovered from the 
excavations in unit A. The first, a flat piece of iron was recovered from the topsoil. 
This was understood to be a piece of a larger blade and due to its size, level of 
preservation and similarity to machete blades used today it is believed to be of 
recent origin. The second piece of iron was recovered from the subsoil. This object 
was quite small and ambiguous and thus no interpretation of its use has been made. 
The final item came from the pit fill of the conical pit. This item was a broken, 
concreted iron blade, most probably from a knife or possibly a projectile such as a 
small spear. The third item is unexpected in a context that has been interpreted as a 
rubbish pit for domestic waste. The find here is unusual because iron can be re-
smelted and is not normally discarded. However, it is possible that this piece was 
unintentionally interred in the pit because no other pieces were found. This final 
piece has been submitted to Jane Humphris study of iron metallurgy in Rwanda 
and is awaiting analysis.   
7.8 Summary  
The survey results from the central region broadly match the results from the 
southern survey zone and suggest that site location has expanded over the Iron Age 
but has not drastically changed. Potentially representing an increase in population 
and clearance of lower areas, down slope. The survey was also successful at 
identifying a variety of Iron Age archaeological materials across central Rwanda, 
suggesting that there are still many archaeological resources to be explored in this 
area.  
The excavations at Karama (GPS014) were very successful. They identified two 
sealed archaeological features containing zooarchaeological and palaeobotanical 
remains in contexts dated to c.700AD alongside a potential devolved Urewe ceramic. 
The identification of these remains will help this thesis tackle two of the research 
objectives identified previously. For example, the ceramic remains suggest that 
Urewe may have devolved in Rwanda as has been identified elsewhere in Great 
Lakes Africa and thus there is more ceramic variety in the Iron Age than the 
established typology reflects. And the subsistence economic remains suggest that 
economic exclusivity, a subsistence trichotomy, should not be assumed in the 
terminal 1st millennium AD in central Rwanda. The significance of these finds within 
Rwanda and Great Lakes Africa will be explored in detail in Chapter 9. 
Chapter Eight 
Research Findings from Northern Rwanda 
Case Studies 3, 4, 5 & 6 
This chapter presents the results from the systematic survey and excavations in the 
northern study zone. It will briefly discuss the survey results for the whole study 
zone before detailing the research findings from case studies 3, 4, 5, & 6.  
8. 1 Northern Survey Results

lines indicate roads whilst the thinner red lines are tracks and paths (the bold blue line is a join in two 
maps) (reproduced and adapted with permission from CGIS Rwanda)  
Systematic and opportunistic survey was undertaken in the northern study zone over 
two months from February to March 2007. The largest administrative centre in the 
northern survey zone was Ruhengeri (now called Musanze) (Fig. 2.1) and all new 
sites identified during the work were given a Ruhengeri Pragmatic Survey (RPS) 
number. In the northern survey zone (Fig. 8.1) nineteen new sites and five previously 
published sites were identified (Fig. 8.2) (Hiernaux and Maquet 1960; Nenquin 1967a; 
Simon 1983; Van Noten 1983). Of the previously published sites three had been 
partially excavated, Masangano, the Musanze Caves and Bugarama, and two, 
Nyanga Cave and Kiguhu, had been mentioned based on their surface assemblages. 
Van Noten (1983) excavated two test units at the Musanze Caves, Simon (1983) 
conducted larger scale excavations at Bugarama and Hiernaux and Maquet (1960), 
Czikan (unpublished), Van Noten (1983) and Simonet (2004) have excavated test 
units at Masangano.  
Fig. 8.2 Satellite image showing total sites identified in the northern survey zone 
The landscape in the northern survey zone is very striking. The highest volcanoes 
rise to around 4000m above sea level, whilst their slopes descend approximately 
2200m to the shores of Lake Bulera and Lake Ruhondo to the southeast. The smooth 
sides of the volcano and the western lakeshores are in stark contrast to the sharply 
undulating steep hills to the northeast and south of the lakes. The boundary of the 
Virunga National Park that skirts the base of the volcanoes, combined with the 
borders of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda to the north, and the 
shores of the lakes to the east, prevented the establishment of a regular 15km x 15km 
survey zone. Therefore an irregular shaped survey zone was created that covered an 
approximately similar surface area but respected these political and natural 
boundaries. As in the southern and central study zones the survey followed all 
available track-ways, paths and roads including a survey of the shores of lakes Bulera 
and Ruhondo. However, the northern survey zone presented a range of new survey 
problems not seen previously. For example the volcanic geology, which characterises 
much of the surface geology of the area is extremely similar in appearance to iron 
slag, hindering the identification of iron production remains because they were not 
readily distinguishable at the surface. Where soil and sub-soil deposits do lie above 
the solidified lava they are extremely thin thus reducing the potential for sub-surface 
archaeological deposits. Furthermore, the eastern edge of the lakes is extremely steep, 
and the Nyabarongo river valley is an area of dense banana cultivation, preventing 
effective survey in both of these areas. These limitations and biases have reduced the 
interpretative potential of the survey results from the northern study zone. However, 
it is suggested that a conservative reading of the survey results reveals basic 
patterning distinct from that found in the other study zones that may be culturally 
significant. 
The survey found that, unlike in the previous zones, sites in the north were not 
distributed evenly and instead clustered around particular areas. For example, the 
slope between the volcanoes and the lakes, where the geology is made up of large 
lava flows and very thin soils, with the exception of the volcanic caves and RPS001 
and RPS002, was devoid of sites. Instead sites were located close to the lake, in caves 
or on different geology to the northeast and south of the lakes. The survey in the 
northern zone identified one new potential Early Iron Age site, RPS014, and re-
identified three previously published sites, one with Urewe pottery, Masangano and 
two with potential Urewe variants, Bugarama and Kiguhu (see Fig 8.3) (Simon 1983; 
Van Noten 1983). None of the Early Iron Age Urewe sites in northern Rwanda were 
found in association with surface metal production remains and they were all located 
close to river or lakeshores, nestling beneath rock outcrops or higher altitude 
features. This represents a departure from the pattern seen in central and southern 
Rwanda.  
Fig. 8.3 Satellite image showing Urewe sites in northern survey zone 
The survey identified twelve new sites with Late Iron Age roulette-decorated 
ceramics and five previously published sites Nyanga, Bugarama, Masangano, the 
Musanze Caves and Kiguhu Cave (Simon 1983; Van Noten 1983). The survey results 
suggest there was a shift in site location between the Early Iron Age and Late Iron 
Age in northern Rwanda. The Late Iron Age sites in the northern study zone are also 
distinctly different from those identified in central and southern Rwanda. For 
example, whilst twisted-string roulette-decorated ceramics and knotted-strip 
roulette-decorated ceramics were commonly found on the surface of these sites (Fig. 
8.4), most sites were found in volcanic caves (Fig. 8.5) and only two sites with Late 
Iron Age ceramics were found in association with surface iron production waste, 
RPS001 and RPS002. Furthermore, whilst sites generally remain close to the lakes, 
sites also begin to appear in higher altitude zones on the volcanoes and there is a 
significant departure to the northeast and south where sites, such as RPS006 and 
RPS007 and RPS011, are located away from the volcanic geology. These sites are 
situated in a sharply undulating landscape similar to, but steeper than, that found in 
southern and central Rwanda, and the site elevation data clearly shows an increase in 
site elevation between the Early Iron Age and Late Iron Age (Figs. 8.6 and 8.7).

As in the southern and central zones, the relocation of previously published sites was 
an important element of the survey in northern Rwanda, whilst the general locations 
of these sites were identified with relative ease, the specific locations of the relevant 
deposits were again more difficult to identify. For example, the Musanze Caves are 
well known large geological features, but the names of the individual caves appear to 
have changed or been forgotten. Van Noten (1983: 34-35) reported excavations in two 
caves, Cyinkomane and Akameru, yet these names were not known by even the 
oldest of the local residents and these sites had to be re-identified based on published 
black and white photos taken of the cave entrances (Van Noten 1983: Plate 40). Both 
Masangano and Bugarama were easier to locate; Masangano has been revisited by 
archaeologists and geologists regularly and is a very well defined site at the junction 
of the Nyabarongo and Mukungwa rivers; and Bugarama was published with a 
detailed site map and accurate co-ordinates (Simon 1983). However, the co-ordinates 
published by Nenquin (1967a: 286) for Nyanga Cave located it in northern Burundi 
instead of northern Rwanda and this site had to be re-located based on a very general 
text description and map illustration. Even when the published co-ordinates for a site 
were correct it was not always possible to identify specific locations. For example, 
whilst Kiguhu was quickly relocated, without a detailed site plan it was virtually 
impossible to identify the specific area where the few published sherds had been 
found in a vast cultivated marshland. 
Discussion  
Despite the biases associated with the survey and the problems encountered whilst 
relocating sites, the survey in northern Rwanda has made an important empirical 
contribution to this research by successfully identifying a range of extant 
archaeological resources. Furthermore, based on a typological assessment of the 
surface assemblages, basic site distribution patterns have been identified. These 
include a preference in the Early Iron Age for lacustrine and riverine environments 
and an absence of sites in the higher altitude regions. However, during the Late Iron 
Age whilst some of these locations continue to be utilised sites begin to appear in 
caves and away from lakeshores and rivers. There was also a lack of iron production 
remains identified during the northern survey. Whilst the local volcanic geology may 
have obstructed the identification of these remains during the survey it is also likely 
that the local geology prevented iron production on the scale seen in the south and 
central zones because the necessary components for iron production were not in 
plentiful supply.  
A much lower site density was also observed in the northern zone compared to the 
central and southern zones. It is suggested that this variation in density reflects 
environmental and historical differences between the zones. For example, the central 
and southern zones remained at the core of the Nyiginya Kingdom throughout the 
latter half of the 2nd millennium AD whilst the northern zone existed at the periphery 
of the kingdom for much of the similar period and was not fully incorporated into 
the kingdom until a period of aggressive expansion that occurred under King 
Rwabugiri in the late 19th century (Vansina 2004: 172). These unstable political 
circumstances combined with the dense equatorial rainforest that covered much of 
the northern zone until recently, and thin volcanic soils that still cover much of the 
area today, would have reduced the opportunities for survival in this region 
compared with more attractive opportunities further south. Even a fishing economy 
would have been more difficult here than elsewhere due to the volcanic biochemistry 
of the lakes which continues to prevent the establishment of a sizeable fish stock in 
the lakes today. These environmental and political factors may have reduced the 
possibilities for human colonisation of the area. The anomalies within the northern 
survey results cannot simply be explained by survey biases and it is believed that 
they relate to changing socio-cultural and environmental opportunities afforded to 
the Iron Age occupants of the region.  
8.2 Northern Excavation Results 
Due to the poor potential for sub-surface archaeological deposits in both the 
southern and central zones, the northern zone became the focus of the excavation 
season. The northern zone was known to have a number of sites with previously 
identified sub-surface deposits such as the Musanze caves, Masangano and 
Bugarama (Hiernaux and Maquet 1960; Nenquin 1967a; Van Noten 1983; Simon 
1983) that were relevant to the research aims of this project. For example, caves are 
often assumed to be the historical refuge of forager groups, however, test units 
excavated in two of the Musanze caves, Cyinkomane and Akameru, during the 
1970s (Gautier 1983: 104-120; Van Noten 1983: 33-35) revealed hunted remains 
alongside domestic species, with indirect evidence of agriculture in the form of grain 
harvesting knives and grinding stones. This presented an interesting context in 
which to investigate the subsistence economy and to establish if this was an isolated 
occurrence or if this was a wider phenomenon in northern Rwanda during the Late 
Iron Age. The cave excavations at Akameru in the 1970s also produced a late 1st 
millennium AD radiocarbon date from charcoal excavated from contexts with 
roulette-decorated pottery (Van Noten 1983: 35). This is the second earliest date ever 
published for Late Iron Age ceramics in the region - the earliest is an unreliable date 
from southern Rwanda (Van Grunderbeek 1992), which has since been questioned 
due to its high standard deviation (see Chapter 4 section 4.2). Thus, by collecting 
more dating material from a wide variety of caves this research aimed to establish a 
more confident date for the earliest occupation of these caves. The other sites were 
chosen so that material from a range of locations could be compared: Masangano 
was known, based on surface assemblages and the published material, to preserve a 
variety of Early Iron Age and Late Iron Age ceramics; Nguri Cave and Mweru Cave 
preserved substantial Late Iron Age surface ceramic assemblages in contrasting 
locations; RPS014 preserved an unusual incised ceramic type by the lakeshore; and 
based on Simons (1983) illustrations (Van Noten 1983: Plates 92-95) it was believed 
that Bugarama might preserve ceramics dating to the terminal 1st millennium AD 
(see Chapter 4 section 4.4). 
Fig. 8.8 Satellite image showing excavated sites in northern survey zone 
In total eight sites, which include three cave entrances at Musanze, were excavated 
in the northern study zone (Fig. 8.8). However, excavations at two of these sites 
Bugarama and RPS014 were unsuccessful. Bugarama, identified and excavated by 
Simon (1983: 137-144), is located on the shore of Lake Bulera and according to 
Simons description and illustrations (Van Noten 1983: Plates 92-95) appears to have 
contained both Early Iron Age and Late Iron Age ceramics in a single sequence. 
Unfortunately, the lake levels have risen considerably since the previous 
excavations, possibly as a result of the construction of a hydroelectric dam, and 
much of the site has become submerged (Fig. 8.9). Due to the lake level rise we had 
to situate the excavation units away from both the waters edge and away from the 
most interesting areas of the previous excavations. Two 1x2m test excavation units 
were excavated at Bugarama at the base of an escarpment where large quantities of 
Late Iron Age ceramics were observed on the surface. Both units were excavated to 
approximately 0.8m before they became flooded and whilst both units encountered 
Late Iron Age twisted-string and knotted-strip roulette-decorated ceramics, both 
failed to reach any sealed contexts above the water table. Another lakeshore site 
RPS014, located at Mweru, was identified by the presence of incised ceramics seen at 
the surface. Two 1x2m test excavation units were excavated at RPS014 and these 
were explored until the lake-level was reached and the units became flooded but 
both units failed to encounter any archaeological deposits.

8.3 Case Study 3: Masangano 
Masangano is one of the best known and most researched archaeological sites in 
Rwanda (Hiernaux and Maquet 1960; Nenquin 1967a; Van Noten 1983; Simonet 
2004). The reason for this attention can be traced to its prominence in oral traditions 
(Kagame 1972, 1975), its unique and dramatic location and the prevalence of surface 
archaeological material and features. Masangano is situated at the confluence of the 
rivers Nyabarongo and Mukungwa (14402.8 S, 293923.2 E, 1422m above sea level) 
and covers an approximately 200 x 200m area on a low escarpment over-looking the 
rivers at the foot of a deep valley. The site was first mentioned in the archaeological 
literature by Hiernaux and Maquet (1960) who excavated a test unit there and this 
work was followed up in 1961 by Czikan who carried out some small-scale 
excavations on behalf of the Rwanda Geological Survey (Nenquin 1967a: 266). 
Unfortunately, neither Hiernaux and Maquets, nor Czikans excavations were ever 
fully published. Furthermore, believing these reports to be imminent, Nenquin 
(1967a: 266-267) only briefly described his surface finds collected in 1960. Nenquins 
(1967a: 266) summary of his and Hiernaux and Maquets work reports the 
occurrence of quartz implements of the Wilton type in association with Dimple-
based ware (Early Iron Age, Urewe ceramics) at a relatively shallow depth and that 
B-Ware (Late Iron Age roulette-decorated pottery) was also found on the surface 
and in the humic layer (Nenquin 1967a: 266). The site was not returned to 
archaeologically until Van Noten (1983: 24, 36) conducted small-scale trench 
excavations in the late 1970s.  Van Noten reported a range of Stone Age and Iron 
Age materials but did not encounter any secure stratigraphy and concluded that 
these finds had been mixed due to agricultural disturbance. Numerous informal site 
visits have taken place since this early work and this can be measured by the 
growing collection of finds that have accumulated at the National Museum of 
Rwanda. The only other excavations known to have taken place at Masangano are 
those undertaken by Celine Simonet (2004) on behalf of the Institute National Muse 
de Rwanda (INMR). This work again revealed the presence of quartz stone tools, 
Early Iron Age Urewe ceramics and Late Iron Age roulette-decorated ceramics. 
However, Simonet, unlike Van Noten, reported distinct context changes, suggesting 
that the site had not been uniformly disturbed and that areas of undisturbed 
stratigraphy still existed.  
Today, whilst it is clear that Masangano has been subject to heavy disturbance 
through cultivation, where the land is clear of crops it is still possible to identify 
distinct areas of past human activity preserved as depressions, raised areas and/or 
changing soil colours. An intensive transect, pedestrian, site survey revealed areas of 
find concentrations amongst a range of archaeological deposits visible at the surface. 
However, due to INMR commitments with other archaeological institutions, that 
limited where we could place our units, we focused our excavations at the southern 
end of the site in two distinct and contrasting deposits. Test unit A was located at the 
edge of the site next to a steep slope above the river confluence. The surface deposit 
here was sandy and contained a number of large Urewe sherds. Test unit B was 
located to the north of test unit A on top of a raised area of very dark, bluish-black 
soil close to where Simonets excavations are believed to have taken place. The 
locations of Simonets test units were not well reported in the document submitted 
to the INMR and we relied upon local people and surface anomalies to direct us to 
them. This strategy allowed us to explore a new area of the site whilst also 
maximising the potential for the recovery of suitable data by excavating a known 
deposit that was reported to contain preserved stratigraphy. 
Fig. 8.10 Illustration showing east-facing section from unit A, Masangano 
Test excavation unit A, a 2x1m trench, was excavated to a depth of 1.2m. Yet, despite 
the presence of Urewe style ceramics on the surface and to a depth of 0.2m, unit A 
encountered no significant archaeological deposits. Below the loose surface sands at 
0.2m, unit A contained a series of sterile sand deposits (Fig 8.10). The excavations in 
test unit A were discontinued at a depth of 1.2m after 1m of sterile deposits had been 
excavated. There were no environmental or radiocarbon samples taken from unit A 
as no suitable contexts or materials were encountered.  
Test excavation unit B began as a 1x2m trench but was twice extended to the west to 
follow an archaeological horizon and to increase the size of the archaeological 
assemblage recovered. The deposits encountered in unit B were distinctly different 
from those recorded by Simonet nearby and a more detailed account of the 2004 
excavations is needed to better understand this anomaly. Unit B contained three 
well-defined archaeological deposits above natural clay and sands (Fig. 8.11). The 
most recent archaeological deposit, a bluish black, silty-clay [B1] that had suffered 
significant disturbance through cultivation, contained only very rare roulette-
decorated pottery, and quartz flakes. Beneath this was a bluish-black, sub-soil [B2] 
that was more compact than the previous layer and which contained very rare 
incised pottery, quartz flakes and iron slag. The surface soil and sub-soil sealed an 
archaeological horizon beneath [B3]. This secure archaeological deposit was a 
brownish black clayey-silt that contained frequent incised pottery, rare charcoal, 
poorly preserved bone, occasional quartz flakes and a single bone bead. 
Environmental and radiocarbon samples were taken from this deposit, however, the 
other deposits encountered were not sampled due to the high probability of 
disturbance and contamination through cultivation. The excavations in unit B 
encountered a sterile deposit of brown clay [B4] immediately beneath the 
archaeological horizon. However, exploratory excavations were continued in the 
eastern end of unit B to a depth of 2m. The sterile clay was found to sit above a thin 
calcareous deposit and sterile sand beneath [B5].  
Fig. 8.11 Illustration showing east-facing section of unit A, Masangano 
Whilst the excavations in unit A failed to encounter any archaeological deposits, 
they have helped to expand our understanding of the stratigraphy across the site. 
The few large Urewe sherds that were identified at the surface of this unit were 
probably the result of secondary deposition, transported there by cultivation. Based 
on the ceramic remains the archaeological horizon [B3] identified in unit B was dated 
to the 1st millennium AD, and the later contexts, [B1] and [B2], disturbed by 
agriculture, were identified as mixed deposits containing rare 1st and 2nd millennium 
AD incised and roulette decorated ceramics. 
Despite Masanganos prominence in Rwandan archaeology, no absolute date has 
previously been produced for the site. Thus a charcoal sample from the undisturbed 
context [B3] with incised ceramics was sent for radiocarbon analysis and this 
returned a mid 1st millennium AD date (Fig. 8.12).

OxA-19520 Archaeological Horizon 1698  27 BP 266  534 AD 
Fig. 8.12 Table showing radiocarbon results from unit B Masangano 
This date suggests that the archaeological horizon fits within the Early Iron Age, 
Urewe using, period in Great Lakes Africa. This date also places Masangano in a 
chronologically comparable position to BPS036/Kabusanze in southern Rwanda. 
Therefore, the investigation here will focus on the assemblage from the 
archaeological horizon in unit B and the comparison of these results with those from 
Kabusanze. 
8.4 Palaeobotanical, Zooarchaeological and Other Finds 
There were no environmental samples taken from test excavation unit A at 
Masangano and no zooarchaeological material was identified during the excavation 
of this unit. Environmental samples were taken from the Early Iron Age 
archaeological horizon in test excavation unit B but no palaeobotanical remains were 
recovered during processing of these samples. Whilst zooarchaeological remains 
were identified and recovered from unit B these were extremely fragmented or 
degraded which prevented identification. The lack of well-preserved 
zooarchaeological and palaeobotanical material, in contrast to other Early Iron Age 
sites in this study, such as BPS036/Kabusanze and GPS014/Karama (see Chapters 6 
and 7, sections 6.6 and 7.5-6), may be the result of the moist rich humic soils at this 
site, which would have helped these materials biodegrade. There was only one small 
find recovered, a shell bead, that was identified in the disturbed upper levels of test 
excavation unit A and this is of little interpretative value because these so far 
undiagnostic artefacts are ubiquitous at Iron Age sites in Great Lakes Africa. 
Therefore, in the absence of any other data sets, the focus of the research at this site is 
the incised ceramics that dominate the excavated assemblage. Initial analysis 
suggested that these are distinct from the Classic Urewe from Kabusanze but have 
some similarities with the potentially devolved material from Karama.  
8.5 Ceramic Analysis 
The ceramics from test excavation unit B have been divided into two groupings, 
those from the topsoil [B1] and subsoil [B2], and those from the Early Iron Age 
archaeological horizon [B3]. The probability of disturbance and mixing between the 
topsoil and subsoil means that there is little purpose in distinguishing between these 
two assemblages on the basis of stratigraphy. However, the archaeological horizon 
beneath appears to be undisturbed and so will be dealt with separately. Following 
the methodology set out in Chapter 5 the ceramic analysis will again be divided into 
technological and morphological profiles. 
Technological Profile 
Within the assemblage from Masangano were identified ten different fabrics, MSG1 
 MSG10. The prefix here refers to Masangano. The properties for each fabric are 
listed below (Fig. 8.13):

Fig. 8.13 Table showing the fabric groups identified in the Masangano assemblage 
The total assemblage recovered from the excavations at Masangano was limited in 
size and weighed only 2.9kg, with the majority of this coming from the Early Iron 
Age archaeological horizon (2.2kg). Ten different fabric types were identified within 
the Masangano assemblage. However, some of these fabrics are very rare and may 
be related, for example the fabrics MSG2, MSG3, MSG6 MSG7, MSG8, MSG9 and 
MSG10 only account for 7.5% of the entire assemblage. It is possible that these 
groupings represent idiosyncrasies and inconsistencies in one of the other better 
defined and more dominant fabric groups. The remainder of the total assemblage 
was dominated by MSG1 (39%), MSG4 (28.5%) and MSG5 (11.5%). The fabric 
frequency is quite different when the upper, disturbed deposits, [B1] and [B2] are 
separated from the Early Iron Age archaeological horizon [B3] beneath. The 
assemblage from the upper levels was made up of MSG4 (80%), MSG10 (6%), MSG9 
(2%) and a miscellaneous group (12%), whilst the assemblage from the 
archaeological horizon was made up of MSG1 (53.5%), MSG5 (15%), MSG4 (9%), 
MSG6 (3%), MSG7 (2%), MSG2 (1%) and MSG8 (0.5%). This distribution suggests 
that fabric preference changed between the Early and the Late Iron Age at 
Masangano. For example, fabrics MSG9 and MSG10 only appear in the later deposits 
and are associated with Late Iron Age roulette decoration. Whilst it is possible that 
the presence of MSG4 in both the Early and Late Iron Age contexts may suggest 
ceramic continuity between these periods, this remains very speculative due to the 
high potential for contamination through cultivation in these upper deposits. The 
technological profile of the Early Iron Age assemblage from Masangano can also be 
compared with the profile from Kabusanze in the south. For example, the 
Masangano assemblage from the archaeological horizon was dominated by a single 
fabric group, MSG1, as was the Kabusanze assemblage. The two sites are similar 
both in the restricted number of fabric types but also in the broad similarity in fabric 
type of B1 from Kabusanze and MSG1 from Masangano. However, a comparison of 
their morphological profiles demonstrates a high level of variation between the two.   
Morphological Profile 
Twenty-one reconstructable vessels were recovered from the excavations at 
Masangano, two from the upper levels [B1] and [B2] and nineteen from the Early 
Iron Age archaeological horizon. Both of the vessels from the upper levels fit the 
Early Iron Age Urewe typology and therefore, due to the limited size of the 
assemblage, these will be included and analysed with the Early Iron Age 
assemblage. Two major vessel forms dominate the reconstructable assemblage from 
Masanagano, open bowls (38%) (Fig. 8.14, d and 8.15, e) and hemispherical bowls 
(28.5%) (Fig. 8.16, i), with the remainder of the assemblage made up of everted neck 
jars (9.5%) (Fig 8.15, a), closed bowls (9.5%) and straight necked jars (5%) (Fig. 8.17). 
The frequency of forms at Masangano presents a 14.5:85.5 ratio of jars to bowls 
which is in direct contrast to the 60:40 ratio Ashleys (2005) on the northern shores of 
Lake Victoria and with Van Grunderbeeks (1988) work in southern Rwanda 
(discussed in Chapter 4 section 4.4).

Fig. 8.19 Table showing simplified distribution of forms relative to fabrics (n=21) from Masangano 
The distribution of vessel form relative to fabric group (Figs. 8.18 and 8.19) 
demonstrates a preference in jars and bowls for specific fabrics. The globular jars and 
beakers are entirely confined to fabric MSG1, and the straight-necked jars and closed 
bowls are entirely confined to fabric MSG4, whilst the remaining bowl forms have 
been made from a variety of fabrics. However, this is a very small assemblage and 
these associations cannot be confirmed without investigating a larger sample. 
The rim type frequency distribution is also in contrast to that seen in the Kabusanze 
assemblage (Fig. 8.20). At Kabusanze bevelled rims dominated the assemblage (88%) 
with the remainder made up of rounded (8%) and squared rims (4%), whilst at 
Masangano rounded rims dominate the assemblage (62%) with bevelled rims (19%), 
squared rims (14%) and tapered rims (5%) accounting for the remainder.  There were 
also no complex bevelled rims recovered from Masangano unlike at Kabusanze 
where 29% of the reconstructable vessels displayed four or more bevels.  
Fig. 8.20 Graph showing vessel opening diameters for reconstructable vessels from Masangano  
Twenty-one reconstructable vessels from Masangano were sufficiently complete to 
allow a rim diameter to be estimated for them. The results of this analysis (Fig. 8.20) 
show that whilst the smallest sizes (10cm) exist at Masangano, the largest sizes seen 
at Kabusanze (e.g. 40cm) are not present in this assemblage and the widest vessel 
openings at Masangano, in the 25-30cm range, are associated with open bowl 
boudin ceramics. The difference between the remaining Masangano assemblage 
and the Kabusanze assemblage can be attributed to the higher frequency of small 
bowls at Masangano compared to Kabusanze. However, it is notable that larger jars 
were identified during previous excavations (e.g. Hiernaux and Maquet 1960; Van 
Noten 1983: Plate 37) and thus this assemblage may not be representative of the site.

Fig. 8.21 Table showing the distribution of decoration type relative to form at Masangano  
There were twelve reconstructable vessels with decoration identified at Masangano 
and many of the decorative styles seen in this assemblage are consistent with those 
expected for Urewe, such as oblique incised and incised cross hatching (Fig. 8.21). 
However, the presence of crude rocker-stamping (Fig. 8.14, a), crude linear 
punctuates (Fig. 8.15, b) and boudin decoration (Figs. 8.14, d and 8.15, e) are 
unexpected. None of these applications were observed in the Kabusanze assemblage 
and are not part of the generally expected Urewe typology. Perhaps the most 
unexpected is the boudin, a crude type of decoration that appears to show the 
unsmoothed ceramic coils on the outer surface of the vessel formed during the 
production of the vessels. There are clear similarities between this style of decoration 
and that seen at sites such as Murchisons Falls (Soper 1971; Connah 1997) and 
Kansyore Island (Chapman 1967) in Uganda. However, boudin has never been 
identified in Rwanda before. Although similar ceramics have been illustrated by Van 
Noten (1983) from Kabuye. 
The full decorative scope of the Masangano assemblage only becomes clear when 
decoration is considered in the total analysed assemblage from the archaeological 
horizon [B3]. The total assemblage consisted of two hundred and ninety-three sherds 
and ninety-eight of these displayed decoration. Of the decorated sample seventy-five 
were incised, nine had punctate decoration, three were comb-stamped, two were in a 
boudin style, two had fingernail impressions and one had stab-drag decoration. 
Within the incised group there were multiple examples of fingernail impressed 
sherds (8.14, c), herringbone incision (Fig. 8.14, b), crosshatching (Fig. 8.15, a), 
triangular punctate (Fig. 8.15, b) and incised circular motifs (Fig. 8.14, c). Whilst there 
are again clear decorative parallels with the established Urewe typology, for 
example the incised circular motifs are extremely similar to those seen in Kabusanze, 
the existence of fingernail impressed and boudin application is unexpected.  
An analysis of the various decorative zones showed that decoration is always 
contained on the neck or lip and there are no examples of interior decoration or body 
decoration. There were also no bases recovered from the assemblage at Masangano.  
Although Masangano is first mentioned by Hiernaux and Maquet (1960) the 
ceramics mentioned are only briefly described and illustrated. There are also no 
published reports on the ceramics from Hiernauxs or Czikans excavations. 
However, there are illustrated ceramics from Nenquins (1967a) brief review of 
surface ceramics collected in 1960. Nenquin (1967a: 266) described and illustrated 
one rim sherd with a heavily bevelled rim, incised cross hatching on the neck and a 
second shoulder sherd with cross hatchings above a series of parallel horizontal 
grooves and hanging triangles. Nenquin (1967a: 266) assigns these to dimple-based 
A-Ware and both of these are clearly within the Classic Urewe type. The 
remaining sherds include pieces with vertical and wavy line incisions that Nenquin 
assigns to C-Ware.  The only other published account of ceramics from 
Masangano is Van Notens (1983: 23-24), who also encountered Classic Urewe or 
Type-A pottery with multiple bevels on the rims, incised cross hatching, chevrons, 
and hanging triangles. However, within the ceramics he assigned to Type-A, an 
Early Iron Age grouping, there are also examples of ceramics with more irregular 
incised lines, punctates, stab-dragged punctate and rocker-stamping, sometimes 
alongside the expected bevelling that Van Noten (1983: 35-36) refers to as non-Urewe 
Early Iron Age ceramics. These ceramics compare well with those found in the 
archaeological horizon at test excavation unit B (discussed in detail in Chapter 9 
section 9.4).  
8.6 Summary 
When combined with the published material the ceramic assemblage from 
Masangano fitted well with a Classic Urewe typology. There was a range of bevelled 
rims, both complex and simple, a restricted fabric range, with a range of vessel forms 
and incised geometric motifs. However, it is clear that in contrast to these 
continuities there is significant variation. There is a severe contrast in the ratio of jars 
to bowl forms, a reduction in the ratio of bevelled to non-bevelled rims and the 
inclusion of unexpected decoration types such as fingernail impressions and 
boudin. Whilst, the dating evidence combined with the general characteristics of 
this assemblage place it well within the Urewe ceramic tradition, the ceramic 
anomalies must be addressed. It is suggested here that this assemblage includes 
Classic Urewe ceramics; contemporary, or post-Urewe, less well-executed Urewe 
type ceramics; alongside related boudin ware. This may be the result of various 
groups, with differing but related ceramic traditions using the same site; the same 
group using the same site but changing ceramic styles over time; or the importation 
of different ceramics from the wider region. This mixture may in part be related to 
the geographic position of Masangano. Masangano is located at the confluence of 
two major rivers just to the south of the Virunga Volcanoes and sits at the meeting 
point of two very different geographic landscapes. Thus, due to its position at a 
crossroads, in well watered and fertile grounds, this historically popular location 
may have encouraged the meeting of a number of co-existing traditions at this 
location in the 1st millennium AD and later. 
This assemblage makes an important empirical contribution to our understanding of 
ceramic distribution in the Early Iron Age in Great Lakes Africa, summarized below: 
 The first radiocarbon-dated deposit from Masangano that dates the earliest 
context encountered [B3] to the early to mid 1st millennium AD, which places 
this deposit within the Early Iron Age in Rwanda and Great Lakes Africa.  
 The identification of discrete archaeological deposits at Masangano and the 
identification of an undisturbed archaeological horizon. 
 The establishment of a dated Urewe ceramic assemblage at Masangano, 
demonstrating that Urewe users were not confined to hilltop locations, in 
contrast to the results from southern and central Rwanda. 
 The tentative identification of related Urewe variants at a single site, within a 
single dated deposit. 
8.7 Case Study 4: The Musanze Caves, Musanze District, Rwanda  
The Musanze caves are a series of large volcanic features located to the west of 
Ruhengeri (1 30 S  29 36 E). Nenquin (1967a: 275-6) was the first to note the 
archaeology in the caves. He visited the caves and recorded surface finds including 
traces of possible hut-circles, B-Ware and Modern Ware (roulette-decorated 
pottery), and a large collection of human skulls. The skulls were analysed by Brabant 
(1963) and were believed to be the product of conflict in 1914-1918 and the 
subsequent use of the cave as a cemetery. Prior to this research the only excavations 
to have taken place in the caves were those undertaken by Van Noten (1983: 34-35). 
Van Noten excavated a test unit in two of the caves, Cyinkomane and Akameru, in 
the late 1970s. In both test excavation units Van Noten encountered approximately 
2m of deposit containing B-Type and C-Type ceramics (roulette-decorated 
pottery), animal bones, quartz blades and iron objects. The animal bones were 
analysed by Gautier (1983: 104-120) and the assemblages were found to have both 
herded and hunted species present. A charcoal sample was taken from the earliest 
context at Akameru and this produced a date of 875  95 AD (Van Noten 1983: 35) 
(discussed in Chapter 4 section 4.2).  
Based on these published reports, the Musanze caves were chosen for re-
investigation because they presented an opportunity to work at a readily locatable 
site, with well-defined stratigraphy and a variety of subsistence remains amongst a 
range of Late Iron Age material culture.  
The specific research aims for this case study were: 
 To relocate Cyinkomane and Akameru where Van Noten excavated. 
 To excavate a range of previously unexplored neighbouring caves in order to 
collected comparative material.  
 To collect zooarchaeological samples to investigate Gautiers (1983) findings. 
 To collect a ceramic assemblage to explore Van Notens B-Type and C-
Type roulette-decorated ceramics. 
 To collect dating material from the earliest archaeological contexts to 
investigate Van Notens early potentially erroneous date for the Late Iron 
Age in northern Rwanda (see Chapter 4 section 4.2). 
 To take environmental samples from the cave to investigate the plant foods 
exploited by the occupants of the caves. 
Whilst it was not possible to relocate Akameru and Cyinkomane based on their 
names alone, because there are multiple cave entrances in the area and these names 
have now been forgotten, it was possible to re-locate them based on published 
photographs (Van Noten 1983: Plate 40). Alongside Akameru and Cyinkomane, five 
other cave entrances were identified during the survey that were deemed suitable 
for excavation: having large enough entrances and living areas for human occupants; 
including excavation spaces not obstructed by large rock falls from the ceiling; and 
preferably without regular modern activities such as cultivation taking place 
(banana plants are often planted immediately inside and around the caves). The 
identified cave entrances were numbered Musanze I  V. Upon return to the caves in 
the second season Musanze I and Musanze IV were found to be occupied by large 
colonies of bats and so were deemed unsuitable for excavation at that time. Thus, the 
three remaining cave entrances, Musanze II, III and IV, were selected.  
All of the caves are located within 100m of each other and whilst they each have 
their own idiosyncrasies they are generally very similar, all having entrances 
between 5 and 10m wide and ceiling heights of the same dimensions. The caves all 
had a large quantity of twisted-string roulette-decorated pottery on the surface 
alongside rare knotted-strip roulette-decorated pottery, and some contained animal 
and human bone remains. The hut-circles encountered by Nenquin (1967a: 274-
276) were not identified but low dry-stone walls were found immediately inside 
each of the cave entrances. The local explanation for these walls suggests that they 
were put there to prevent rebel soldiers using the caves during recent conflicts. 
Although this seems improbable because the walls were never more than 0.8m tall in 
caves with ceilings approximately 10m tall, the same story was repeated in all of the 
caves we visited in northern Rwanda.  
The test excavation units were positioned by selecting an area away from the drip 
line of the cave, in a flat central area not disturbed by rock falls. The test units in all 
of the caves were excavated to bedrock except unit A in Musanze II which had to be 
discontinued due to earlier rock falls that prevented further excavation. All of the 
caves had extremely good bone preservation and the excavations consistently 
produced large quantities of Late Iron Age roulette-decorated ceramics, wood 
charcoal and animal bones, alongside bone beads and a range of metal objects.  
8.8 Musanze II  
Excavations at Musanze II, located at southing 01.30.338, easting 029.36.869 and 
elevation 1868m. Two 1x2m test units were excavated in the cave (Fig. 8.21). Test 
excavation unit A was dug to a depth of 1m. The excavations in unit A were 
discontinued before natural bedrock or natural gravel deposits were reached. The 
excavation had to be ceased due to the presence of many large rocks covering the 
base of the unit. Instead of extending this trench a new unit was started in a different 
area because an extension to unit A may have encountered more rocks. Within unit 
A, a number of well-defined contexts were identified (Fig. 8.22). The first context 
[A1] was a soft grey, clayey-silt with frequent pot and bone. This context sat above a 
hard white calcareous layer [A2] that sealed a greyish brown, silty-sand with 
frequent pot and bone [A3]. This context sat above another calcareous band that 
sealed a deposit of brown clayey silt containing rare finds [A4].

Fig. 8.22 Illustration showing east-facing section of unit A, Musanze II 
Test unit B was excavated to a depth of 1.6m above natural gravels and bedrock (Fig. 
8.23). Beneath the rain damaged surface deposit of mixed clayey-silt [B1] was a large 
1m deep deposit of soft medium blackish-brown, clayey-silt with occasional lenses 
of white calciferous material [B2]. Whilst frequent pot, bone and charcoal were 
recovered from this context the quantity of finds reduced dramatically. Beneath this 
context was a large horizontal deposit of white calciferous material that sealed the 
earliest archaeological context [B3] below, which contained a very high frequency of 
pottery, bone and charcoal amongst other finds.

The ceramic assemblage from Musanze II consisted almost entirely of Late Iron Age 
twisted-string roulette-decorated ceramics, with only two reconstructable knotted-
strip vessels coming from the most recent deposit in unit B. Twisted-string roulette 
decorated ceramics were present from the very earliest to the latest deposits. A 
charcoal sample from the earliest stratigraphic deposit in unit B, which was sealed 
beneath a hard calciferous deposit, was radiocarbon dated and this sample 
generated an early 2nd millennium AD date (Fig. 8.24), suggesting that Musanze has 
been occupied since the beginning of the Late Iron Age.

8.9 Ceramic Analysis 
The Musanze caves are extremely close together and are often linked through large 
volcanic tunnels. For this reason a single set of fabric groupings has been established 
for use with all three of the cave entrances (Fig. 8.25). Following the methodological 
position set out in Chapter 5 the ceramic analysis will be divided into technological 
and morphological profiles. 
Technological Profile 
Within the assemblage from the Musanze caves were identified twelve different 
fabrics M1  M12. The prefix here refers to Musanze. The properties for each fabric 
are listed below:

The total assemblage recovered from the excavations at Musanze II was large, 
weighing 23.95kg. Nine different fabric types were identified within the Musanze II 
assemblage. One fabric dominated the total assemblage; M1 (44%) and the 
remainder consisted of M4 (15.5%), M7 (11%), M6 (6.5%), M2 (5%), M3 (1.5%), M10 
(1%), M5 (0.5%), M11 (0.5%) and a miscellaneous group (14.5%). The frequencies of 
fabrics between the excavations units were found to be broadly similar with M1, M4, 
and M7 again dominating both. Test excavation unit A encountered four 
stratigraphic deposits, the earliest of these [A4] only contained a very limited 
ceramic assemblage, 10 sherds (0.05kg), which were assigned to three different fabric 
types M1 (10%), M6 (70%) and M7 (10%).  The size of the assemblage increased but 
was still quite limited in the next earliest deposit [A3] (0.29kg) and contained five 
different fabric groups M1 (46.5%), M2 (1.5%), M4 (33%), M6 (5%), and M7 (14%). 
There was a considerable increase in the assemblage size in the next earliest deposit 
[A2] (4.5kg) but the fabric types, if not the frequency, remained the same M1 (17%), 
M2 (8%), M4 (47%), M6 (10.5%), M7 (8.5%) and a miscellaneous group (9%).  In the 
most recent deposit [A1] the assemblages remained large (3.52kg) and whilst two of 
the fabric groups, M6 and M7, were no longer represented three new fabric groups 
appear, M3, M5 and M11. This assemblage was again dominated by M1 (55%) with 
the remainder made up of M2 (9%), M3 (8%), M4 (7.5%), M5 (0.5%), M11 (3.5%), and 
miscellaneous (16.5%). The frequency of fabric distribution across the deposits from 
test excavation unit A suggests a limited range of fabric types increasing over time 
and whilst there is continuity between all the stratigraphic deposits, for example the 
persistence of M1 and M4, there are potentially significant variations with the 
disappearance of fabrics M6 and M7 in the latest deposit  represented in all three 
other deposits  and the appearance of three new fabric types, especially the 
appearance of M5, a very fine and distinctive fabric.  
The excavation in test unit B encountered two separate deposits with ceramic 
assemblages, the earliest [B3] of which was radiocarbon dated to the early 1st 
millennium AD. This early deposit contained 6.66kg of ceramics that consisted of 
fabrics M1 (26.5%), M7 (26%), M6 (14%), M4 (10%), M2 (3%) and miscellaneous 
(20.5%).  In the later larger deposit [B1] a ceramic assemblage weighing 8.92kg was 
recovered and this consisted of M1 (67%), M4 (6.5%), M7 (4.5), M2 (3%), M10 (2.5%), 
M5 (1.5%), M6 (1.5%), M3 (0.5%) and miscellaneous (13%). As seen in test excavation 
unit A, the variety of fabrics employed increases in the later deposit and whilst fabric 
M11 was not identified fabrics M3 and M5 appears. These results continue to suggest 
that fabric selection increased over the Late Iron Age occupation of this cave and that 
the fine fabric, M5, was only accessed or produced by the occupants of Musanze II 
during its later occupation.  
Morphological Profile 
Forty-two reconstructable vessels were recovered from the excavations at Musanze 
II, four from test excavation unit A and thirty-seven from test excavation unit B. All 
of the vessels fit the Late Iron Age roulette-decorated typology. However, there are 
notable anomalies such as the presence of decorated handles (Fig. 8.26), and the 
appearance of very fine twisted-string roulette decoration associated with fabric M5. 
The total reconstructable assemblage from Musanze II consists of four vessel forms; 
globular everted neck jars (44%) (Fig. 8.27), straight necked jars (29.5%), closed bowls 
(14.5%) and hemispherical bowls (12%). This distribution shows a clear preference 
for larger storage vessels with 73.5% of the assemblage consisting of jars and only 
26.5% of bowls. This may reflect the greater importance of collecting and storing 
water at a location away from any major suitable water sources or may reflect a food 
preparation system that was not reliant on serving vessels, such as roasting. The 
assemblage from Kabusanze also suggests that whilst a range of fabric choice was 
available to the caves occupants, the forms were very limited.

Fig. 8.28 Table showing the distribution of forms relative to fabrics from Musnze II (n=42) 
The distribution of fabric relative to form (Fig. 8.28) across the total assemblage 
suggests that whilst fabrics M1 and M7 are used for a variety of forms, M4, M5 and 
M11 are restricted to single forms. This is especially significant for M5, which makes 
up 85.71% of all the closed bowls identified.  
Fig. 8.29 Graph showing vessel opening diameters for the reconstructable vessels from Musanze II  
Musanze II produced forty vessels that were sufficiently complete to allow the 
opening diameter to be estimated (Fig. 8.29). This analysis showed a broadly even 
frequency distribution from approximately 10 to 35cm. (The small vessel opening, 
3cm, correlates to a very small closed pot). However, 60% of the vessels fall in the 17-
26cm ranges and suggest a slight preference for this middle range. A brief 
consideration of vessel form relative to vessel opening showed no significant 
pattering. For example, jars were found to have opening sizes including the smallest 
to the largest diameters, and whilst open bowls did not include the smallest 
openings, as may be expected, they also displayed a wide diameter range. Changes 
in vessel diameter between contexts were also considered but no significant 
variation was identified.

Fig. 8.30 Table showing frequency of rim types relative to form from Musanze II 
As expected from a Late Iron Age ceramic assemblage, bevelled rims are not 
represented. Instead, simple squared, rounded and tapered rims, with rare examples 
of thickened and folded rims, dominated the reconstructable assemblage (Fig. 8.30).  
Whilst the absence of bevelled rims is notable, the assemblage is not completely 
unlike the rims seen in the Early Iron Age assemblage from Masangano where 
rounded, squared and tapered rims were common alongside bevelled rims.  
The decorative range from Musanze II is extremely limited being completely 
confined to Late Iron Age rouletting. For this reason the decorative analysis here will 
focus on the variations within this application, especially its position and direction, 
relative to form. Only two reconstructable vessels from the most recent deposit in 
test excavation unit B [B1] displayed knotted-strip rouletting with the remainder 
exhibiting twisted-string roulette decoration. Within the total site assemblage out of 
355 decorated sherds only 30 exhibited knotted-strip roulette decoration and these 
were again only from the most recent deposits in the test excavation units. For these 
reasons the analysis here will focus on the twisted-string roulette decorated 
assemblage and its application because the knotted-strip roulette assemblage is too 
limited in size to reveal potentially significant patterning.  
The clearest difference in twisted-string roulette decoration application is the angle 
at which it is applied relative to the rim, generally this is either applied diagonally 
left or diagonally right from the rim, although it may also be applied horizontally, 
vertically or very rarely in a combination of these.

Fig. 8.31 Table showing frequency of twisted string roulette direction at Musanze II relative to form 
An analysis of the frequency of twisted-string roulette direction relative to form (Fig. 
8.31) shows that whilst the left diagonal is more frequently used the assemblage is 
too small to suggest a meaningful pattern. However, the direction of application 
relative to the closed bowls does appear to show a preference for mixed rouletting. 
This is potentially significant as all of the closed bowls in this analysis are from the 
M5 fabric grouping, which continues to suggest that this may represent a 
typologically distinct sub-group within the more general Late Iron Age ceramic 
typology for this region.

 Fig. 8.32 Table showing the frequency of incidences of decoration relative to location at Musanze II 
By tabulating the occurrence of decoration on the decorative zones there appears to 
be a preference for decoration of the vessel upper region, although there are 
examples of decoration across the possible range (Fig. 8.32). However, the closed 
bowls  all from fabric group M5 - show a more defined location grouping on the 
vessel body. Further demonstrating the restricted nature of this type and the 
potential that it represents a new example of Late Iron Age roulette decoration in 
these caves.    
Six bases were identified in the total assemblage, however it was not possible to 
attribute a vessel form to the bases. The bases were all rounded, with three examples 
of thickening on the inside and one flat based with a raised area on the inner surface.  
There were four handles identified within the assemblage, three were made from 
single coils and one from three coils, and all were decorated with twisted-string 
rouletting. The only surface treatment observed on any of the vessels was burnishing 
applied to all of the fabric M5 closed bowls.  
The ceramic assemblage from Musanze II compares well with the general Late Iron 
Age typology for the region and it is also quite similar to that published by Van 
Noten (1983: Plates 42 and 44) for the Musanze caves, including twisted-string 
rouletting, rounded bases and roulette-decorated handles. However, far from simply 
re-affirming Van Notens assemblage this analysis has developed our understanding 
of the ceramics in the Musanze caves by the possible identification of a well-defined 
sub-type of Late Iron Age roulette-decorated ceramics, the very fine, black, M5 
burnished ware.  
8.10 Zooarchaeological Analysis 
The caves produced the largest zooarchaeological sample out of all the excavated 
sites. They contained a wide range of zooarchaeologcial remains including wild and 
domesticated species. However, because Musanze II unit A was discontinued due to 
a rock fall the zooarchaeological sample from this unit is a lot smaller than those 
from the other caves. In the first two contexts [A1] and [A2] no zooarchaeological 
remains were recovered. A zooarchaeological sample was recovered from the 
following context [A3] although it was very small and only one specimen was 
identified to genus, a burnt duiker (Cephalophus) radius. The remaining specimens 
could only be identified to bovidae Bovid Size Class 3 (Fig 8.33). There were five 
unidentified fragments from this context.

The earliest context [4] also had a very small zooarchaeological sample, only three 
specimens were identified from an assemblage of eight, leaving five unidentified 
fragments. These three specimens could only be attributed to Bovid Size Class 3 (Fig. 
8.34).

In unit B, beneath the surface deposit of silt and calcareous/liming/leaching from 
the cave ceiling, was a large deposit [B1] containing a substantial zooarchaeological 
assemblage (Fig. 8.35). Three hundred and forty-two specimens were recovered and 
from these one hundred and seventy-six of these were identified. The assemblage is 
dominated by bovidae both wild and domestic but also includes carnivora, rodentia, 
birds and suidae. Within this deposit [B1] Bovid Size Class 5 was represented by 
twenty-six specimens, Bovid Size Class 4 by four specimens, Bovid Size Class 3 by 
sixty-four specimens, Bovid Size Class 2 by one specimen and Bovid Size Class 1 by 
six specimens, this spread suggests that the animals exploited fall between the 
medium and larger size ranges. Which is to be expected because these are likely to 
give the largest nutritional return per individual. The domestic species are 
represented by cattle (Bos taurus), goat (Capra hircus) and sheep (Ovis aries), and the 
aging evidence suggests both immature and very old animals were exploited. Within 
the domesticated assemblage there is evidence of butchery in the form of knife cut 
marks, other modification is confined to burning and gnawing. The wild remains 
include species that may have been hunted for food but also ones such as lion 
(Panthera leo) that are less obviously related to subsistence. The potential wild 
subsistence remains include bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus), reedbuck (Tragelaphus 
spekeii), great forest hog (Hylochoerus meinertzhageni), common duiker (Silvicapra 
grimmia), kob (Kobus kobus) and elephant (Loxodonta Africana), some of which such as 
bushbuck and elephant show evidence of butchery in the form of chop marks and 
knife cut marks (Fig. 8.36).

In the following context [B2] there were no zooarchaeological remains. However, in 
deposit [B3] the zooarchaeological assemblage included frequent Bovidae specimens. 
Whilst Bovid Size Class 3 was most common, Size Classes 5, 4 and 1 are also present 
in the assemblage and there is evidence of butchery, including chop marks and knife 
cut marks (Fig. 8.37). Again the most significant remains in terms of the specific 
research questions are the occurrence of domesticated stock, cattle (Bos taurus) and 
sheep/goat (Ovis/Capra) remains, alongside wild, potentially hunted or gathered 
ones, such as bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus), with knife cut marks, and smaller 
species such as duiker (Cephalophus) and common duiker (Silvicapra grimmia). These 
remains suggest that from the earliest occupation of the caves wild and domestic 
species were accessible and were utilised by the cave dwellers.

Fig. 8.37 Table showing the zooarchaeological remains from [B3] Musanze II 
Summary 
The zooarchaeological assemblage from Musanze II included a wide range of 
species, both domestic and wild, from very large specimens to small. Unfortunately 
due to the very small size of the assemblage from unit A and its incomplete nature 
because of its discontinuation due to rock falls this assemblage is of little 
interpretative value. However, the assemblage from unit B demonstrates that in the 
two phases represented a range of species both domestic and wild was exploited.  
8.11 Palaeobotanical Analysis 
Although no palaeobotanical samples were taken from unit A, three samples were 
taken from unit B: one from the top of the first phase [B1], one from its base [B1] and 
one from the final sealed and dated context [B3]. These samples revealed some 
unusual remains. Whilst finger millet remains (Eleusine coracana) are not unexpected 
in a Late Iron Age context, the manner in which they have been preserved is. 
Although one charred seed was identified all the other remains from all three 
samples preserved non-carbonised seeds, some with traces of crystallised calcium 
carbonate around them which may explain their preservation in an un-charred state. 
Based on observations by Dr. Dorian Fuller, they are not believed to be recent (Pers 
comm. 2008). Instead they are thought to be the product of crystallisation by calcium 
carbonate dissolved in the deposit that leaches through the walls of all of the caves 
in the region. In the earliest context [B3] there were also found charred remains of 
wild plants including wild flowers (Boraginaceae), wild fruits including hackberry 
(Celtis) and parenchyma (general plant tissue). The wild fruit remains alongside the 
domestic plant remains suggest that the cave occupants utilised a range of plant food 
both cultivated and foraged. 
8.12 Other Finds 
There was one small-find recovered from test excavation unit A, a fired bullet, found 
in the most recent deposit [A1] (Fig. 8.38), suggesting that this stratigraphic phase 
includes recently deposited material from the mid-late 20th century conflicts. Whilst 
no conflict material was recovered from test excavation unit B, a group of small finds 
from the most recent context [B1] were identified. These finds include an oblong 
bead (Fig. 8.39), a polished bone bead (Fig. 8.40), an ivory bead (Fig. 8.41), a bone 
whistle (Fig. 8.42) and a broken iron billhook type blade. There was only two finds 
from the earliest dated context in test excavation unit B [3], a white shell bead (Fig. 
8.43) and an iron bracelet (Fig. 8.44).

8.13 Musanze III 
The Musanze III entrance is located at southing 01.30.435, easting 029.36.89 and 
elevation 1821m, and sits above a low dry-stone wall beneath. Two 1x2m excavation 
units were located along the eastern edge of the cave in a large flat area to the east of 
a steeply sloping rock fall (Fig 8.45). Test excavation unit A was excavated to a depth 
of 1.3m and contained a series of thin lenses (Fig 8.46). The first context [A1] 
consisted of a sterile medium brown, clayey-silt, that was soft and dusty with a faint 
light brown band running through the middle. Following this was a series of thin 
clayey silts [A2] separated in part by thin lenses of white calciferous material. 
Beneath these layers were two larger similar contexts of light to medium grey clayey 
silt, [A3] and [A4] and these two contexts were separated by a thin band of 
calcifereous material and sat above bedrock.

Fig. 8.46 Illustration showing east-facing section of unit A, Musanze III 
Test excavation unit B was excavated to a depth of 1.2m and encountered a similar 
set of deposits to those found in unit A (Fig. 8.47). Again the first context [B1] 
consisted of a medium brown, clayey-silt, that was soft and dusty with a faint light 
brown band running through the middle. Following this context were a series of 
clayey silt deposits with frequent Late Iron Age pottery, bone and charcoal [B2  B4]. 
The clayey silts sat above natural bedrock with a thin calcareous deposit on its 
surface.

Fig. 8.48 Table showing the radiocarbon date from the earliest archaeological context [B4] unit B at 
Musanze III  
A single date was sought from the stratigraphically earliest deposit from unit B [B4] 
and this sample returned a date for the early 2nd millennium AD (Fig. 8.46). This date 
is very similar to the one produced for the earliest context from Musanze II and 
continues to place the earliest occupation of the caves at the beginning of the Late 
Iron Age. 
8.14 Ceramic Analysis 
Technological Profile 
The total ceramic assemblage from the test excavations at Musanze III weighed 
44.19kg. Within the total assemblage ten fabric groups were identified: fabric M1 
(68%) dominated the assemblage and the remainder was made up of fabrics M2 
(9%), M10 (4%), M11 (3.5%), M7 (3%), M9 (3%), M8 (2%), M12 (1%), M3 (0.5%), M6 
(0.5%) and miscellaneous (5.5%). A similar frequency was identified in both of the 
test excavation units, which were again dominated by fabric M1 and to a lesser 
degree M2.  The stratigraphically earliest deposit in test excavation unit A [A4] 
contained a ceramic assemblage weighing 3.3kg with fabrics M1 (29%), M2 (24.5%), 
M11 (16.5%), M7 (9.5%), M10 (2.5%), M9 (1%) and miscellaneous (17%). The size of 
the assemblage increased considerably in the next context [A3] to 6.06kg and 
included fabrics M1 (39.5%), M2 (20%), M11 (14%), M10 (9%), M7 (4.5%), M9 (3.5%), 
M12 (1.5%), M6 (0.5%) and miscellaneous (7.5%). The assemblage is broadly similar 
in the next latest deposit [A2], weighing 9.73kg and including M1 (79.5%), M10 (8%), 
M2 (3.5%), M7 (2.5%), M9 (2%), M3 (0.5%), M8 (0.5%) and miscellaneous (2.5%). 
Finally, the most recent deposit [A1] in test excavation in unit A contained very few 
finds and may be related to the abandonment of these caves as regular living areas 
in more recent times. The assemblage from this deposit weighed only 0.23kg and 
contained fabrics M1 (49%), M2 (10.5%) and miscellaneous (40.5%).  
The earliest deposit in test excavation unit B [B4], radiocarbon dated to the 
beginning of the 1st millennium AD, contained a sizable ceramic assemblage 
weighing 11.63kg.  Within this assemblage six fabrics were identified: M1 (91.5%), 
M11 (3%), M2 (1.5%), M6 (1.5%), M12 (1%), M7 (0.5%) and miscellaneous (1%). This 
proportion remained stable throughout the later contexts [B3], [B4] and [B5]. The 
evidence from Musanze III contradicts that from Musanze II, which suggested an 
increase in fabric choice over time. Conversely, at Musanze III the evidence suggests 
a wide range of fabrics were available from the earliest occupation of these caves and 
throughout their use.  
Morphological Profile 
Sixty-three reconstructable vessels were recovered from the excavations at Musanze 
III, thirty-one from test excavation unit A and thirty-two from test excavation unit B. 
All of the vessels fit the Late Iron Age roulette-decorated ceramic tradition and as at 
Musanze II there are decorated handles (Fig. 8.49, d) although the very fine roulette 
decoration associated with fabric M5 is absent. The total reconstructable assemblage 
from Musanze III consists of six vessel forms; straight necked jars (36.5%), everted 
neck globular jars (30%), hemispherical bowls (11%) (Fig 8.48, a, b and c 
respectively), beakers (11%) and closed bowls (9.5%). This distribution shows a 
preference for larger storage vessels (66.5%), as at Musanze II.

Fig. 8.51 Table showing the distribution of forms relative to fabrics from Musanze III 
 The distribution of fabric to form (Fig. 8.51) reflects the pre-dominance of fabric M1 
within all vessel forms. However, analysis of the rim types (Fig. 8.52) show parallels 
with those from Musanze II but with a preference for simple squared rims (52.5%) 
followed by simple rounded rims (30%), thickened rims (9.5%) and tapered rims 
(8%). Although there appears to be no particular preference for form as the various 
types occur across a range of forms.

Fig. 8.52 Table showing frequency of rim types relative to form from Musanze III 
Fig. 8.53 Graph showing vessel opening diameters for the reconstructable vessels from Musanze III  
The reconstructable assemblage from Musanze III produced sixty-three vessels that 
were sufficiently complete to allow a rim diameter to be estimated (Fig. 8.53). The 
full range spans from 8 to 37cm and although the greatest frequency is 18cm in 
diameter, the distribution is roughly even and is not form specific. The range is not 
dissimilar to the one encountered in Musanze II. 
The decorative range from Musanze III, as at Musanze II, was completely confined 
to Late Iron Age rouletting. Within the reconstructable assemblage from Musanze III 
there was only one vessel with knotted-strip roulette decoration and this was in the 
most recent context from test excavation unit A. The rest of the total and 
reconstructable assemblage was decorated with twisted-string roulette decoration. 
There were fifty-three reconstructable vessels and four hundred and forty-five 
sherds decorated with twisted-string roulette decoration from the total assemblage. 
As in the assemblage from Musanze II, the direction of rouletting was consistent on 
each vessel either being diagonally left or right or horizontal but never a 
combination except on handles. With the exception of the open bowls, which are 
only represented by two examples, all vessel-form types display both directions of 
rouletting in broadly even proportions (Fig. 8.54).

The application of decoration relative to vessel zone demonstrates a preference for 
decoration around the lip and neck of jars and to a lesser degree bowls (Figs. 8.55 
and 8.56). There is also a preference for interior rouletting in jars but this is rarely 
seen in the bowls.

There was only one base identified in the total assemblage and this came from the 
dated context in test excavation unit B [B4]. This base had a flat bottom and a raised 
area on the inner surface (Fig. 8.57). There were also only two handles identified in 
the total assemblage and both were made of double clay bands and were decorated 
with twisted-string roulette decoration. There was no surface treatment observed on 
any of the ceramic samples from the total assemblage.

8.15 Zooarchaeological Analysis 
In the first and stratigraphically most recent of the four deposits in unit A [A1] the 
zooarchaeological assemblage was dominated by bovidae (Fig. 8.57). Eleven Bovid 
Size Class 5 and four Bovid Size Class 3 specimens were identified, both with 
examples of knife cut marks and one with gnawing. Of the specimens identified to 
species there were two domestic specimens; a cattle (Bos taurus) first phalanges with 
knife cut marks, and a sheep/goat (Ovis/Capra) lower fourth premolar. There were 
also two duiker (Cephalophus) specimens and two other rodentia specimens. In this 
deposit there was also a broken femur from an immature Homo sapiens. This human 
specimen is likely to have been from conflict in the mid to late 20th century AD. 
There were twenty-five unidentified specimens from this context.

The next context [A2] contained the largest zooarchaeological assemblage 
from the deposits in unit A (Fig. 8.59). This deposit was dominated by bovidae. 
There were fifteen Bovid Size Class 5 specimens, two Bovid Size Class 4 
specimens, thirty-seven Bovid Size Class 3 and eight Bovid Size Class 1 
specimens. Of these specimens identified to family, five had evidence of knife 
cut marks, one had chop marks and one showed gnawing. Six cattle (Bos 
taurus) specimens were identified one with knife cut marks and one with 
chop marks. Eight sheep/goat (Ovis/Capra) specimens were identified that 
represented at least two individuals and two of the specimens had knife cut 
marks. Of these two domestic groupings there were examples of specimens 
from immature and mature individuals, suggesting that no particular 
slaughter pattern was being employed. Of the other large bovidae remains 
there was one example of sitatunga (Tragelaphus spekei) and one waterbuck 
(Kobus ellipsiprymnus) showing knife cut marks, indicating that wild animals 
were being butchered. Of the smaller wild species represented there were two 
white-bellied duiker (Cephalophus leucogaster) and one specimen that could 
only be attributed to duiker (Cephalophus), a hyrax (Procaviidae) and two 
common duiker (Silvicapra grimmia) specimens. Of the remaining assemblage 
there were ten bird bones, six rodentia and ninety-three unidentified 
specimens.

Fig. 8.59 Table showing the identified zooarchaeological assemblage from [A2] Musanze III  
The following context [A3] contained twenty-three specimens of Bovid Size Class 5 
that represented at least three individuals (Fig. 8.60). This sample contained two 
specimens with gnawing, four burnt specimens, and two specimens with knife cut 
marks and two with puncture marks. Significantly two scapula specimens from this 
group showed evidence of breaking to access the marrow cavity (Figs. 8.61 and 8.62). 
This suggests that the occupants of the cave were accessing all available sources of 
meat and nutrition and therefore may not have had a plentiful access to meat at all 
times, thus needing to maximise the nutritional return from each source. It is also 
possible that these portions are socially or symbolically important, however, these 
areas have not been accessed on all scapula examples. Thirty-seven specimens from 
Bovid Size Class 3 were identified, one with burning, one with gnawing and three 
with knife cut marks. Six Bovid Size Class 1 specimens were identified, one with 
burning and gnawing. Domestic species cattle (Bos taurus) and sheep/goat 
(Ovis/Capra) were also identified. Four cattle specimens were identified. The most 
interesting of these specimens was the mandible that had a series of knife cut marks 
(Fig. 8.63). There were six sheep/goat specimens representing at least two 
individuals, one burnt specimen and one with knife cut marks. With the exception of 
seven bird specimens the remaining identified specimens from this deposit come 
from large mammals including three bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus) specimens, one 
burnt, three sitatunga (Tragelaphus spekeii) specimens, one with knife cut butchery 
marks, one kob (Kobus kob) specimen, and one elephant (Loxodonta africana) 
specimen. Whilst the bushbuck, reedbuck and kob specimens are not unexpected, 
the elephant specimen is interesting. Another elephant specimen was recovered 
from a similar deposit in Musanze III unit B and that specimen like this one was 
immature.

The zooarchaeolgical sample increased in variety in the following context [B3] (Fig. 
8.67). The context contained six Bovid Class 5 specimens, two with burning and one 
with gnawing, one Bovid Size Class 4 specimen, thirty-five Bovid Size Class 3 
specimens, thirteen with burning, one Bovid Size Class 2 specimens with burning 
and four Bovid Size Class 2 specimens, two with burning. The domestic remains in 
this context included five cattle (Bos taurus) specimens including a mandible from an 
individual with a killed age class of L or IX (suggesting a very old animal >42 
months) by molar tooth wear, and six sheep/goat (Ovis/Capra) specimens, one burnt 
and one gnawed. The identified wild specimens include two bushbuck (Tragelaphus 
scriptus) specimens one with gnawing, two kob (Kobus kob) specimens, one duiker 
(Cephalophus) specimen, one common duiker (Silvicapra grimmia) specimen, three 
rodentia specimens, one Lagomorph specimen and one bird specimen. This deposit 
contained nine unidentified specimens.

The stratigraphically second earliest deposit (B4) contained fifteen Bovid Size Class 5 
specimens, four with knife cut marks and one burnt, nineteen Bovid Size Class 3 
specimens, three with burning and one with knife cut marks, one Bovid Size Class 2 
specimen and three Bovid Size Class 1 specimens, one with burning (Fig. 8.68). The 
domesticated remains included five cattle (Bos taurus) specimens, one with knife cut 
marks, and two sheep/goat (Ovis/Capra) specimens, one with knife cut marks. The 
other remains included two Lagomorph specimens, seven bird specimens, nine rodent 
specimens, one Loxodonta africana specimen, one bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus) 
astragalus with burning, one common duiker (Silvicapra grimmia) and one hyrax 
(Procaviidae) specimen. There were twenty-one unidentified specimens from this 
context.

Fig. 8.68 Table showing the identified zooarchaeological assemblage from [B4] Musanze III  
The zooarchaeological assemblage from Musanze III was very similar to that found 
in Musanze II. They both contained immature elephant remains alongside a variety 
of other wild species and domestic species. The Musanze III assemblage also 
contained specimens that had been killed at a variety of ages suggesting that no 
specialised kill model was in place for either the wild or domestic species exploited. 
Furthermore, examples of heavy butchery on the cattle mandible and scapulas 
suggest that the cave occupants were employing maximisation strategies to gain the 
greatest possible nutritional yield from each carcass, perhaps suggesting that they 
did not always have a meat surplus, which in relation to the domestic species, may 
in turn suggest that they were not primarily herders with sustained access to meat 
that a herd could provide. 
8.16 Palaeobotanical Analysis 
Three samples were taken from unit B from the three earliest deposits. Unfortunately 
none of these samples preserved any palaeobotanical remains. Two samples were 
taken from the earliest deposits in unit A and these preserved charred finger millet 
(Eleusine coracana) paleobotanical remains from deposits [A3] and [A4]. Context [A3] 
produced two charred finger millet seeds and two charred fragments, whilst context 
[A4] produced five charred finger millet seeds, and unlike the finger millet remains 
from Musanze II these were not crystallised. Whilst it is unfortunate that remains 
were not found within the radiocarbon dated deposit in test excavation unit B these 
remains do demonstrate that finger millet was being utilised by the occupants of the 
cave during the Late Iron Age and support the evidence from Musanze II.  
8.17 Other Finds 
The small finds recovered from the excavations at Musanze III included iron and 
bone objects. In deposit [A2] a small section of a triangular ivory bracelet was found 
displaying a series of fine incised circles decorated on its surface (Fig. 8.69) alongside 
a broken iron bracelet. The following context [A3] contained a white shell bead and 
an obscure iron object. The earliest stratigraphic deposit [A4] contained a spearhead 
(Fig. 8.70) and an iron bracelet, possibly a childs based on its small size.  Only three 
small finds were made from the excavations in test unit B, a billhook blade from 
deposit [B3], and a white shell bead (Fig. 8.71) and a base of an arrow head (Fig. 8.72) 
from the earliest stratigraphic deposit [B4]. These latter finds are important because 
they come from the only dated context in the cave and are potentially from the 
beginning of the 2nd millennium AD and may relate to hunting and the procurement 
of food at that time. The spearhead and arrowhead also present a rare opportunity to 
study the end results of iron production at this time.

8.18 Musanze IV  
The entrance to Musanze IV is located at southing 01.30.505, easting 029.36.915 and 
elevation 1852m and there is a small dry-stone wall at the foot of the entrance (Fig 
8.73). The cave has a large tree growing in its entrance that is believed locally to 
mark the location of an ancient grave. The test excavation unit at Musanze IV was 
2x2m and was excavated to a depth of 1m before reaching bedrock (Fig 8.74). The 
first context [A1] was light greyish silt with frequent Late Iron Age pottery and bone 
and a lens of calciferous material [A2]. Beneath this was light greyish brown silt [A3] 
with frequent pottery and bone. This context was the most clearly defined, sitting 
beneath a line of stones and above a thin white calciferous deposit. This context also 
contained a thin calciferous lens and frequent Late Iron Age pottery, bone and 
charcoal. The next context [A4], brownish black silt, was followed by the earliest 
context [A5], blackish brown silt, which contained the largest zooarchaeological 
assemblage alongside roulette-decorated ceramics.

Fig. 8.74 Illustration showing west-facing section of Unit A, Musanze IV 
Due to funding limitations no radiocarbon dates were sought for Musanze IV 
because more suitable dateable samples had already been identified from Musanze 
II and III. However, the archaeological material recovered from Musanze IV can be 
dated typologically to the Late Iron Age based on the twisted-string roulette-
decorated ceramics that occurred throughout the excavations and the material is 
very similar to that recovered from Musanze II and III.  
8.19 Ceramic Analysis 
Technological Profile 
The total ceramic assemblage from Musanze IV weighed 25.66kg and consisted of 
eight fabric groups, including M1 (65%), M2 (7.5%), M3 (0.5%), M5 (0.5%), M6 (5%), 
M7 (2%), M10 (17%), M11 (1%) and miscellaneous (1%). The ceramic assemblage 
from the earliest deposit encountered in the test excavations at Musanze IV [A5] 
weighed 2.71kg and contained six fabric groups including M1 (52%), M2 (3%), M6 
(22%), M7 (2.5%), M10 (16.5%), M11 (2%) and miscellaneous (2%). Seven fabric 
groups were identified within the assemblage from context [A4] (1.29kg) including 
fabrics M1 (15.5%), M2 (29.5%), M5 (2.5%), M6 (22%), M7 (18%), M10 (11.5%) and 
M11 (1%). Of significance here is the reappearance of fabric M5, the fine black 
burnished ware that was also identified in the later deposits of Musanze II. The 
ceramic assemblage from the following context [A3] was significantly larger, 
weighing 7.59kg, and was made up of six fabrics including M1 (60%), M2 (10%), M6 
(4.5%), M7 (1.5%), M10 (21%), M11 (2%) and miscellaneous (1%). The following 
context [A2] contained a similar sized assemblage, 8.76kg, and contained seven 
fabrics including M1 (52%), M2 (3%), M6 (22%), M7 (2.5%), M10 (16.5%), M11 (2%) 
and miscellaneous (2%). In this assemblage M5 is again represented and fabric M3 
reappears. The most recent deposit excavated in Musanze IV [A1] contained an 
assemblage weighing 5.49kg and consisted of six fabrics including M1 (74.5%), M2 
(13%), M5 (0.5%), M6 (0.5%), M7 (2%), M10 (8%) and miscellaneous (1.5%). The 
technological profile from Musanze IV describes an assemblage with a varied if 
broadly stable group of fabrics. Fabrics M1, M2, M6, M7 and M10 dominate the 
deposits from Musanze IV, with rare appearances of M3, M5 and M11.  
Morphological Profile 
Forty-six reconstructable vessels were recovered from the total ceramic assemblage. 
Jars were the most common vessel type identified, consisting of globular everted 
necked jars (31%) and straight-necked jars (31%) (Fig. 8.75, c), with the remaining 
assemblage made up of beakers (13.5%) (Fig. 8.73 and 8.75), closed bowls (11%) (Fig. 
8.75, d), hemispherical bowls (8%), flared mouth bowls (2.5%) and open bowls (2%). 
This is an approximately 62:38 ratio in favour of jars and matches the assemblages 
from Musanze II and III and continues to suggest the importance of large storage 
and pouring vessels at this locality during this period.

Fig. 8.78 Table showing the relationship of fabric to form from the total assemblage from Musanze IV 
(n=46) 
The analysis of fabric group relative to vessel form (Fig 8. 78) suggests that there 
may be a correlation between vessel form and vessel fabric. For example, whilst 
fabric M1 occurs evenly between bowls and jars, fabrics M6, M7 and M10 (fifteen 
vessels) are confined to jars, whilst M2, M3 and M5 are confined to bowls (six 
vessels) (Fig. 8.79) However, due to the small size of the assemblage this pattern 
remains speculative and with the exception of fabric M5 has not been replicated in 
the other caves.

Fig. 8.80 Table showing the relationship of form to fabric from the assemblage from Musanze IV (n=46) 
The pattern is also less clear when the vessel form is analysed in relation to fabric 
group (Fig. 8.80). Whilst open bowls are restricted to fabric M1, and flared mouth 
bowls are restricted to fabric M5 the remainder occur within more than one fabric 
group and this distribution again demonstrates the predominance of fabric M1 
within the assemblage.  
The range of rim types within the reconstructable assemblage from Musanze IV (Fig. 
8.81) was similar to that found at Musanze II and III and included simple squared, 
rounded, tapered, thickened and folded rims (Fig. 8.82).

Forty-six decorated reconstructable vessels were recovered from Musanze IV. One of 
the vessels, a closed bowl from the second context [A2], was decorated with a 
horizontal line of punctates, and the remainder were decorated with twisted-string 
rouletting. Identified within the total assemblage were three sherds with knotted-
strip rouletting from the most recent context [A1] and two from the second context 
[A2]. This can be contrasted with the three hundred and seventy-one twisted-string 
decorated sherds recovered from the test excavations.   
Fig. 8.84 Graph showing reconstructable vessel opening diameters from Musanze IV (MIV) 
Musanze IV produced forty-six reconstructable vessels that were sufficiently 
complete for a vessel opening diameter estimate to be made (Fig. 8.84). The analysis 
records a similar range to that for Musanze II and III with the majority spread from 
10-30cm and again there is no clear functional association between vessel opening 
and form with a variety of sizes for all vessels.

Fig. 8.85 Table showing the occurrence of different twisted-string rouletting directions relative to vessel

The general direction of rouletting appears to be broadly evenly split, with a total of 
sixteen examples of left rouletting and twenty-four examples of right rouletting (Fig. 
8.85). However, there is a preference for left rouletting in the straight-necked jars 
with a ratio of 2:12. It is notable that the four vessels decorated with horizontal 
rouletting are from the fabric group M5, the very fine black burnished ware. This is 
consistent with the results from Musanze IV where all the decorated examples of 
fabric M5 were decorated with horizontal rouletting. The single example of punctate 
decoration from Musanze IV also came from the M5 group.

Fig. 8.86 Table showing the incidence of decoration relative to decorative zone and vessel form from 
Musanze IV 
The incidence of decoration relative to decorative zone and vessel form (Fig. 8.86) 
once again demonstrates the preference for decoration on the lip and neck and less 
commonly the body and the vessel interior. There was no interior rouletting on the 
hemispherical or flared mouthed bowls and decoration was absent from the lip and 
body of the flared mouth bowl and closed bowl respectively.  
The only surface treatment observed within the total ceramic assemblage from 
Musanze IV was burnishing on the M5 fabric vessels. There were three bases and 
five handles identified within the total ceramic assemblage from Musanze IV. In the 
most recent context [A1] a conical base was identified, in the second context [A2] a 
flat base was identified with a raised semi-circular interior and a handle with two 
vertical bands decorated with twisted-string roulette. In the third context [A3] three 
handles were identified, these were single banded, double banded and triple 
banded, all decorated with twisted-string roulette decoration alongside a simple flat 
base. There were no handles or bases found in the following context [A4], but in the 
earliest context [A5] a single band handle decorated with twisted-string rouletting 
was found. Whilst these elements are very limited in number restricting their 
interpretative value, they once again demonstrate that a range of base types exist in 
the Late Iron Age typology and that decorated handles exist from the earliest 
deposits through to the most recent. They also exhibit variation through the number 
of vertical clay bands they employ. 
The ceramic assemblage from Musanze IV conforms to those from Musanze II and 
III and to the excavated material from Van Notens (1983) excavations. Again there is 
a greater frequency of jars compared to bowls, and there is a range of coarse fabrics 
alongside the fine M5 fabric, confined to burnished-bowl vessel forms, and 
decorated with horizontal twisted-string rouletting alongside other less dominant 
angles. There is a range of rim forms but these are confined to simple rim forms and 
again the decoration is overwhelmingly dominated by twisted-string rouletting but 
does not exhibit any preference for direction.  
8.20 Zooarchaeological Analysis 
The zooarchaeological assemblage from contexts [A1] and [A2], the most recent 
archaeological deposits encountered at Musanze IV, was very small and only 
contained one Bovid Size Class 3 specimen, fourteen cattle (Bos taurus) specimens, 
one human (Homo sapiens) mandible, one rodent incisor and forty-three unidentified 
bone fragments (Figs. 8.87 and 8.88). The human mandible had suffered severe 
trauma, which suggests that this specimen is the result of recent 20th century conflicts 
and therefore tentatively dates these deposits to the modern era.

Fig. 8.88 Table showing the identified zooarchaeological assemblage from [A2] Musanze IV  
The zooarchaeological assemblage increased significantly in the following context 
[A3] (Fig. 8.90). Identified within this assemblage were ninety-three unidentified 
fragments; twenty Bovid Size Class 5 specimens, one burnt and one with both 
gnawing and knife cut marks; three Bovid Size Class 4 specimens; thirty-one Bovid 
Size Class 3 specimens, five with knife cut marks, one with chop marks, one with 
gnawing and two burnt; seven Bovid Size Class 1 specimens; four bird specimens; 
and two rodent specimens. Domesticated species were represented by nine cattle 
(Bos taurus) specimens, one with knife cut marks, displaying gnawing and etching 
marks, and one 1st phalange with puncture marks resulting from hammering the 
shaft open, allowing access to the marrow, and seven sheep/goat (Ovis/Capra) 
specimens, one with chop marks and one with burning. The aging evidence from 
these domestic remains suggests that these animals were killed at a variety of ages 
because the specimens come from a range of un-fused, just fused and mature 
specimens, and display a range of tooth eruption and wear. The wild specimens 
included a common duiker (Silvicapra grimmia) metatarsal, two bushbuck 
(Tragelaphus scriptus) specimens, and one great forest hog (Hylochoerus 
meinertzhageni) metacarpal. The cattle 1st phalange with puncture marks was 
particularly interesting because it suggests the occupants of the caves had limited 
access to meat, and were attempting to access the smallest nutritional return areas of 
the animals (Fig. 8.89).

Fig. 8.91 Table showing the identified zooarchaeological assemblage from [A4] Musanze IV  
The following context [A5] produced the largest zooarchaeological assemblage from 
Musanze IV (Fig. 8.92). It included seventy-eight unidentified bones; twenty-seven 
Bovid Size Class 5 specimens, seven with burning, three with knife cut marks and 
one with chop marks; one Bovid Size Class 4 specimen with chop marks; forty Bovid 
Size Class 3 specimens, seven with burning, two with knife cut marks and burning 
and one with gnawing; three Bovid Size Class 2 specimens, one with burning and 
one with chop marks; seven Bovid Size Class 1 specimens, one with gnawing, and 
eight rodent, one Lagomorph and one bird specimen. Four cattle (Bos taurus) 
specimens, one with knife cut marks and burning, which came from at least two 
individuals and seven sheep/goat (Ovis/Capra) specimens, one with burning and one 
knife-cut marks, represent the domestic species from this context. Whilst the 
sheep/goat remains are only from mature individuals, the cattle remains come form 
both mature and immature individuals. The wild remains identified to species 
include one elephant (Loxodonta africana) un-fused proximal epiphysis of a tibia with 
chop marks, knife-cut marks and burning; one bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus) 
scapula with gnawing and burning, and two gnawed phalanges; two sitatunga 
(Tragelaphus spekei) specimens with burning and gnawing; one rock hyrax (Procavia 
capensis) mandible; one great forest hog (Hylochoerus meinertzhageni) mandible with 
two incisors; and a common duiker (Silvicapra grimmia) humerus. Of interest from 
the wild assemblage from this context is the immature elephant specimen with 
butchery marks. Similar immature elephant remains occurred in the early deposits 
from Musanze II and III and the possibility that these remains come from a single 
individual and were shared amongst the occupant of the various caves persists. The 
final remains identified were three Homo sapiens specimens. Previously, human 
remains have only been recovered from the upper levels of the excavation units and 
have been attributed to recent conflicts such as the 1994 genocide. However, a 
different cause must have contributed to the deposition of these remains because 
they come from the stratigraphically oldest context that is believed to date from an 
earlier period in the Late Iron Age occupation of the caves. There were no 
archaeological features associated with these human finds that would suggest a 
formal deposition such as a burial and thus it is possible that they relate to an earlier 
violent event.

Fig. 8.92 Table showing the identified zooarchaeological assemblage from [A5] Musanze IV  
Summary 
Within the zooarchaeological assemblage identified at Musanze IV a range of 
butchered wild and domestic specimens were identified to species. This suggests 
that the cave occupants exploited both hunted and domesticated animal populations 
during the Late Iron Age. Furthermore, a butchered immature elephant specimen 
was identified in a stratigraphically similar deposit to those where other immature 
elephant specimens were found at Musanze II and III. It is suggested here that this 
may represent the sharing of a single animal amongst the various caves which if true 
would suggest that these caves were occupied co-currently. Finally, the 
identification of traumatised human remains from both the earliest and latest 
contexts at Musanze IV suggests that the latest contexts date to the recent violent 
episodes in Rwandas 20th century history but that there were also episodes of 
violence in the caves at a much earlier date. 
8.21 Palaeobotanical Analysis 
Soil samples were taken from all the deposits encountered during excavations in 
Musanze IV. However, only one sample from context [A2] preserved 
palaeobotanical remains: two charred parenchyma samples (general plant tissue) 
and one indeterminate fragment. These specimens are of limited interpretative value 
because they are not identifiable to species and they have been obtained from a 
deposit believed to date from the relatively recent past for which historical resources 
exist. 
8.22 Other Finds 
Small finds were recovered from four of the five contexts excavated in Musanze IV. 
The earliest deposit [A5] contained three white bone beads and context [A4] 
contained another white bone bead. Six white bone beads were found alongside an 
iron knife blade and iron projectile point in context [A3] and context [A2] contained 
two white bone beads, one blue bead that had been cut at an oblique angle, a fishing 
hook and two iron projectile points that appear to be small spear heads. The iron 
finds are of particular interest because they may be evidence of the type of hunting 
tools and/or weaponry, employed by the caves occupants. The hook find is also the 
only evidence of fishing that has been recovered from the caves excavated in the 
northern study zone.  
8.23 Case Study Four: Summary 
The excavation results from the Musanze caves identified rich archaeological 
deposits containing a range of significant archaeological materials. For example, 
within the roulette-decorated ceramics a fine black burnished ware (Fabric M5) was 
identified in the later deposits of two of the caves. Furthermore, the 
zooarchaeological and palaeobotanical remains, alongside other finds such as the 
billhook blade, knifes, spearheads and arrowhead, suggest that the cave occupants 
practiced, or enjoyed the results of, a variety of different subsistence activities. 
However, the predominance of hunted remains suggests that a foraging life-style 
dominated the subsistence activities. (These results will be contextualised and 
discussed alongside the other cave results and earlier interpretations of the caves in 
Chapter 9 section 9.20 onwards). 
8.24 Case Study Five: Nguri Cave 
Nguri Cave, RPS003, is located on the steep slopes of the Virunga volcanic chain 
above lakes Ruhondo and Bulera. The cave was identified during survey and no 
archaeological work is believed to have taken place there previously. The cave 
entrance is located at southing 01.25.007, easting 029.42.712 and at an elevation of 
2224m (Fig 8.93). The cave was selected for excavation because it is situated in a high 
altitude environment, in contrast to the Musanze caves.  
Fig. 8.93 Illustration showing site plan of Nguri Cave, RPS003 
In Nguri Cave a 2x2m test excavation unit was excavated to a depth of 1.7m before 
reaching bedrock (Fig. 8.94). The excavations recovered a large quantity of Late Iron 
Age ceramics, bone and charcoal along with occasional beads and metal objects. The 
first deposit [A1] was a greyish brown clayey-silt with frequent pottery and rare 
bone, and this context sat above [A2] a dark brownish black clayey-silt. Beneath this 
was a mixed light brown clayey-silt deposit, more compact than the previous layers, 
with two lenses of white calciferous material [A3]. This context sealed a thin deposit 
of medium to dark brown clayey-silt between very thin calcareous layers [A4]. 
Following this was a large deposit [A5] of medium to dark greyish-brown clayey-
silt. The final and earliest context [A6], which sat above the bedrock, consisted of a 
clayey mid-greyish brown clayey-silt, which was distinct from the deposit above due 
to its greater compaction. All of these deposits contained frequent pottery and 
occasional bones.

Fig. 8.95 Table showing the successful radiocarbon date from [A5] Nguri Cave 
Two radiocarbon dates were sought for the earliest deposits, [A5] and [A6], 
encountered in Nguri Cave. Unfortunately, only the samples from context [A5] 
successfully produced a date. The second sample was reported by the laboratory to 
contain insufficient carbon. The successful date (Fig. 8.95) suggests that human 
activity within Nguri Cave dates to at least the beginning of the 2nd millennium AD.  
A specific aim of the research at Nguri Cave was to explore whether the 
archaeological assemblage recovered here was comparable to that identified at the 
Musanze Caves. By comparing these assemblages it is possible to investigate 
whether the occupants of the Musanze Caves and other caves were part of a wider 
material culture group or whether they were isolated culturally from one another. 
8.25 Ceramic Analysis 
Technological Profile 
The total ceramic assemblage from Nguri Cave weighed 39.83kg and identified 
within it were eight fabric groups. These fabrics have been number 3R1 - 3R8 (Fig. 
8.96). The 3R prefix relates to the site code RPS003 (the original survey site code for 
Nguri Cave). Fabrics 3R3 and 3R4 were originally thought to represent separate 
types, however, it was quickly realised that these were variations within a single 
fabric type and the results have been combined to create a fabric 3R3/4.

Fig. 8.96 Table showing the fabric properties from Nguri Cave 
The total ceramic assemblage excavated from Nguri Cave was dominated by fabrics 
3R1 (56%) and 3R3/4 (16.5%), with the remainder made up of 3R2 (6%), 3R5 (6%), 
3R6 (4%), 3R7 (1%), 3R8 (4.5%) and miscellaneous (6%). The dominance of fabric 3R1 
and 3R3/4 was seen throughout the deposits. In the earliest deposit [6] the 
assemblage weighed 5.94kg and consisted of 3R1 (68.5%), 3R2 (4.5%), 3R3/4 (9.5%), 
3R8 (4%) and miscellaneous (13.5%). The assemblage size increased substantially in 
the following deposit [5] and weighed 17.5kg, consisting of 3R1 (62.5%), 3R2 (7.5%), 
3R3/4 (9.5%), 3R5 (9.5%), 3R6 (4%), 3R8 (2.5%) and miscellaneous (4.5%).  A similar 
grouping of fabrics was identified in context [4] which weighed 3.09kg and consisted 
of 3R1 (35%), 3R2 (6%), 3R3/4 (32.5%), 3R5 (7.5%), 3R6 (15%), 3R8 (3%) and 
miscellaneous (1%). Context [3] weighed 8.12kg and contained the largest range of 
fabrics with the inclusion of fabric 3R7, a black burnished fine ware very similar to 
fabric M5 identified in the Musanze Caves. The assemblage from context [3] 
consisted of fabric groups: 3R1 (43.5%), 3R2 (3.5%), 3R3/4 (28.5%), 3R5 (3%), 3R6 
(3%), 3R7 (3.5%), 3R8 (5.5%) and miscellaneous (9.5%). The size of the excavated 
assemblage reduced in the following contexts and fabric 3R7 was not identified 
again. The second latest context, [2], weighed only 3.1kg and consisted of fabrics 3R1 
(40.5%), 3R2 (9.5%), 3R3/4 (19.5%), 3R5 (4.5%), 3R6 (6%) and 3R8 (10%). Finally, in 
the most recent context [1] the assemblage weighed 26.45kg and consisted of fabrics 
3R1 (64%), 3R2 (8%), 3R3/4 (18%), 3R5 (1%), 3R8 (6%) and miscellaneous (3%).  
The technological profile of the excavated ceramic assemblage from Nguri Cave 
demonstrated that whilst a range of fabrics were utilised by the occupants of the 
cave the choice remained stable throughout the caves occupation with similar fabrics 
found in each deposit. The only notable exception to this is fabric 3R7, which 
appears to be related to the black fine burnished ware previously identified in the 
upper levels of Musanze II and IV.  
Morphological Profile 
There were one hundred and nine reconstructable vessels identified within the total 
ceramic assemblage excavated from Nguri Cave. The assemblage was almost 
entirely made up of jars (90.5%), with only rare bowl types present, including 
hemispherical bowls (3%) (Fig. 8.97, a), closed bowls (7.5%) (Fig. 8.97, b) and flared 
bowls (2%). This distribution suggests a ceramic use assemblage more functionally 
associated with storage and pouring than serving, and this frequency is comparable 
to that identified in the Musanze Caves. An analysis of the relationship between 
fabric group and vessel form (Fig. 8.98) shows that the black burnished fine ware, 
3R7, which can be compared to the M5 fabric from the Musanze Caves, are all bowls, 
including three hemispherical and five closed bowl examples.

Fig. 8.98 Table showing the distribution of vessel form relative to fabric group from Nguri Cave 
A range of simple rim forms were identified within the reconstructable assemblage 
and these included squared rims (55%), rounded rims (25%), thickened rims (9.5%), 
tapered rims (5.5%), folded rims (3%) and beaded rims (2%) (Fig. 8.99). With the 
exception of the two beaded rim examples, the same range of rim types was 
identified within the Musanze Caves. The rim types associated with fabric 3R7 were 
confined to rounded or tapered rims. The distribution of rim types relative to vessel 
form (Fig. 8.95) shows a limited correlation between hemispherical bowls and 
squared rims and flared mouth bowls and beaded rims. However, the other better-
represented vessel forms display a range of rim types.

There were three types of decoration identified within the reconstructable 
assemblage from Nguri Cave, including a single fingernail impressed vessel from 
the earliest context [A6], thirty-three vessels with knotted-strip roulette decoration, 
recovered from the three most recent contexts [A1], [A2] and [A3], and seventy one 
vessels with twisted-string roulette decorated vessels recovered from throughout the 
excavated deposits. Within the total excavated assemblage only one other decorative 
type was represented, a single punctate decorated sherd from context [A5], the rest 
of the total assemblage included one-hundred and thirty-two knotted-strip roulette 
decorated sherds, found in all but the two earliest contexts [A5] and [A6], and four 
hundred and ten twisted-string roulette decorated sherds from throughout the 
sequence.

Fig. 8.100 Table showing the distribution of rouletting angles for twisted-string roulette decorated 
vessels from Nguri Cave 
An analysis of the direction of twisted-sting roulette decoration application suggests 
a preference for roulette direction, not only for the fine black burnished ware, as at 
the Musanze Caves, but also for the jars (Fig. 8.100). The table shows a clear 
preference for left rouletting in jars with forty-nine left diagonal samples and only 
eleven right-sided examples. It is also notable that nine of the ten vessels with 
horizontal rouletting are from the fine black burnished ware, fabric 3R7, and there 
are no other types of rouletting that apply to vessels made from this fabric (Fig 
8.101). This is very similar to the fine black burnished ware from the Musanze Caves 
where rouletting was commonly horizontal, or in a variety of directions.  
Fig. 8.101 Illustrated photograph showing fabric 3R7, black burnished ware, from Nguri Cave 
Fig. 8.102 Graph showing reconstructable vessel opening diameters from Nguri Cave (RPS003) 
The reconstructable assemblage from Nguri Cave produced one hundred and nine 
sufficiently complete vessels for a vessel-opening diameter to be estimated (Fig. 
8.102). The results of this analysis were very similar to the results from the Musanze 
caves and record a broad vessel opening range from 5 to 36cm, although there are 
few above 27cm. There is no identified relationship between the vessel form and the 
vessel opening.    
The frequency with which each of the four decorative positions was utilised relative 
to vessel form (Fig. 8.103) is broadly similar to that identified in the Musanze caves. 
Once again all four zones were employed in jars but internal rouletting was rare on 
the bowls and was totally absent on the hemispherical bowls. However, in subtle 
contrast to the Musanze assemblage there was a higher incidence of internal 
decoration on the jars and the frequency was significantly higher in relation to the 
globular everted rim jars at Nguri Cave. Decoration was totally absent from the lip 
and internal areas of all the 3R7 vessels and was confined to the neck and/or body in 
a similar fashion to the M5 fabric vessels from the Musanze Caves.

Fig. 8.103 Table showing the frequency of decorated zones relative to vessel forms at Nguri Cave 
The only surface treatment identified within the excavated assemblage from Nguri 
Cave was the burnishing applied to all the 3R7 vessels. This was consistent with the 
related fabric M5 from the Musanze Caves, which were also burnished. Four handles 
were identified within the excavated assemblage, one from context [A5] that was 
made from a single wide vertical band, two from context [A3] both made from six 
narrow vertical bands and one from context [A2] made from a single vertical clay 
band. Whilst the handles continue to vary in the number of clay bands, they are 
broadly similar in their form and decoration, and are comparable to those recovered 
from the Musanze caves.  
Ten bases were identified within the excavated ceramic assemblage from Nguri cave. 
In the earliest context [A6] there were two flat bases with raised domes on the 
interior, two thickened rounded bases, and three conical bases. In context [A5] there 
was one simple flat base and two thickened rounded bases, and there was another 
example of this latter type in context [A3]. Whilst the frequency of bases recovered 
was substantially higher at Nguri Cave than in the Musanze Caves the assemblage 
was still too small to be of much interpretative value.  
Summary 
The ceramic assemblage excavated from Nguri Cave is broadly similar to that 
recovered from the Musanze Caves. There was a higher frequency of jars than bowls, 
the ceramics were mostly decorated with twisted-string roulette decoration, similar 
handle forms appear and a range of bases was identified. There was also the 
identification of fabric 3R7 that is both technologically, morphologically and 
stratigraphically comparable to fabric M5 from the Musanze Caves. There was a 
higher frequency of knotted-strip roulette decorated ceramics from Nguri Cave and 
subtle shifts in decorative application, but otherwise the assemblages are very 
similar and based on the evidence presented here are believed to be related. 
8.26 Zooarchaeological Analysis 
There were no zooarchaeological remains recovered from the most recent context 
[A1] encountered in Nguri Cave. However, bovidae remains were recovered from 
context [A2]. This context contained twenty-seven unidentified bone fragments, 
eleven Bovid Size Class 5 specimens, three Bovid Size Class 4 specimens, eleven 
Bovid Size Class 3 specimens, and one Bovid Size Class 1 specimen. The domestic 
remains included seven cattle (Bos taurus) specimens, three with chop marks, all of 
which had reached maturity before death (Fig. 8.104).

Fig. 8.104 Table showing the identified zooarchaeological assemblage from [A2] Nguri Cave  
The zooarchaeological assemblage increased significantly in context [A3] and 
included: seven unidentified bone fragments; twenty-four Bovid Size Class 5 
specimens, three with knife-cut marks and three with burning, two with both knife-
cut marks and burning and one with knife-cut marks and burning; five Bovid Size 
Class 4 specimens, one with chop marks and gnawing, and one with knife-cut 
marks; twenty-nine Bovid Size Class 3 specimens, nine with burning, two with knife 
cut marks, one with knife-cut marks and burning and two that have evidence of 
working, including two ribs with circular perforations at either end; one Bovid Size 
Class 2 specimen with gnawing; one Bovid Size Class 1 specimen; one rodent 
specimen and ten bird specimens. Twelve cattle (Bos taurus) specimens, from at least 
two individuals, represent the domestic assemblage from this deposit. Three of these 
specimens had knife-cut marks, three were burnt and one had been gnawed. The 
fusion and dental evidence for these specimens suggests that elements from both 
immature and mature individuals are present. The only other specimen in this 
deposit was a single duiker (Cephalophus) tibia with knife cut marks (Fig. 8.105).

There were no identified zooarchaeological samples recovered from context [A4] at 
Nguri Cave and the zooarchaeological assemblage from the following context [A5] 
was also small and consisted of only seven unidentified bone fragments, one Bovid

Fig. 8.106 Table showing the identified zooarchaeological assemblage from [A5] Nguri Cave  
The earliest context [A6] contained a relatively large zooarchaeological assemblage, 
including: eleven Bovid Size Class 5 specimens, four with knife-cut marks, and one 
with burning; three Bovid Size Class 4 specimens, one with burning; thirty-four 
Bovid Size Class 3 specimens, two with knife-cut marks and seven with burning; one 
Bovid Size Class 2 specimen with gnawing; five Bovid Size Class 1 specimens; three 
bird specimens; three Lagomorph specimens and nine rodent specimens. The 
domestic assemblage was composed of one cattle (Bos taurus) specimen, six 
sheep/goat (Ovis/Capra) specimens, and two chicken (Gallus gallus) specimens, 
originating from at least two individuals, one with knife-cut marks and one with 
burning (Fig. 8.107). The cattle remains come from an immature individual, aged 0-6 
months, and the sheep/goat remains are from both immature and mature 
individuals. The identified wild assemblage included two duiker (Cephalophus) 
specimens, one kob (Kobus kob) first phalange, one great forest hog (Hylochoerus 
meinertzhageni) radius, one common duiker (Silvacapra grimmia) burnt third phalange 
and one bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus) second phalange.

Fig. 8.107 Table showing the identified zooarchaeological assemblage from [A6] Nguri Cave  
Summary 
Whilst the zooarchaeological assemblage from Nguri Cave is relatively small 
compared to the assemblages recovered from the Musanze Caves, it is similar in 
composition. Throughout the deposits butchered wild species were identified 
alongside butchered domestic ones. The assemblage also continues to suggest that, 
based on the varied age at death estimates for the individuals represented in the 
assemblage, the occupants of these caves had limited access to meat and made use of 
all available resources as and when they appeared.  
8.27 Palaeobotanical Analysis 
Palaeobotanical samples were taken from every archaeological deposit encountered 
during test excavations in Nguri Cave. The identified palaeobotanical remains 
included three charred finger millet (Eleusine coracana) seeds, one parenchyma (plant 
tissue) and one indeterminate seed fragment from context [A3], two charred finger 
millet seeds from context [A4] and three charred finger millet seeds, two charred 
legume (Lablab) seeds and one fragment of a large charred fruit seed from context 
[A5]. These results are consistent with the findings from the Musanze Caves where 
finger millet remains were also recovered and importantly they also demonstrate the 
presence of wild plant use by the cave occupants by the presence of legumes and 
fruits.  
8.28 Other Finds 
There were no small finds recovered from the earliest context [A6] at Nguri Cave. 
However, quartz flakes and two iron projectile points (Fig. 8.108) were recovered 
from the radiocarbon-dated deposit [A5] above, alongside a worked hippo tusk (Fig. 
8.109). Quartz flakes were also recovered from the following context [A4] alongside 
a pounding stone. The greatest range of small finds was recovered from context [A3] 
and included a clay pendant in the form of a large oblong object with a perforation 
that may have been made from unfired clay (Fig. 8.110), an almost complete iron 
bracelet (Fig. 8.111), a worked bone pendant (Fig. 8.112), a small piece of iron that 
may be from a broken blade and three white bone beads. The only other small find 
came from context [A2] and was another pounding stone.

8.29 Summary 
The excavations at Nguri Cave, RPS003, identified a range of archaeological 
materials and produced an early 2nd millennium AD for the start of the caves 
occupation. The finds were consistent with those from the Musanze Caves, including 
a variety of domestic and wild zooarchaeological and palaeobotanical remains. 
However, whilst quartz flakes were found at Nguri they have not been identified in 
any of the other cave assemblages. Unfortunately due to a lack of comparative 
material, the difficulty of quartz analysis and the small size of this assemblage the 
significance of these lithics is not known. Within the ceramic assemblage the most 
significant find was the identification of fabric 3R7, fine black burnished ware, which 
is technologically, morphologically and stratigraphically very similar to fabric M5 
from the Musanze Caves. 
8.30 Case Study Six: Mweru Cave 
Mweru Cave, RPS015, is a small cave site that is located immediately above site 
RPS014, to the north of the large Mweru rock outcrop. The entrance to the cave is 
located at southing 01.24.243, easting 029.45.482 and elevation 1904m (Fig. 8.113). 
The cave was selected for excavation due to its proximity to RPS014 and the 
lakeshore, and because of its size, which is in direct contrast to the previous large 
cave sites, which were located away from the lakes to the north and west. This 
strategy was employed in order to maximise the potential for identifying possible 
variation between the caves.  
Fig. 8.113 Illustration showing site plan of Mweru Cave 
A 2x2m test unit was excavated in the centre of Mweru Cave to a depth of 1.9m (Fig. 
8.114). The most recent context [A1] was a soft mid-greyish-brown clayey-silt with 
rare pot and bone. Context [A2] was more-compact clay that sat above a loose mid-
greyish-brown clayey-silt [A3] with occasional pot and bone above a thin but 
compact layer of white calcareous material. This layer sealed a soft mid-greyish-
brown clayey-silt [A4] beneath which sat on top of a darker greyish brown deposit of 
clayey-silt [A5]. These sat on top of a burnt compact floor of white calcareous 
material and charcoal [A6]. Beneath which, was a light brown clayey silt [A7] above 
a large blackish brown sterile deposit of clayey-silt [A8] above bedrock.

Fig. 8.115 Table showing the radiocarbon samples from contexts [A5] and [A6] at Mweru Cave 
Two charcoal samples were sent for radiocarbon dating from Mweru Cave, these 
came from contexts [A6] and [A7] respectively (Fig. 8.115). These samples both 
returned dates that place the earliest occupation deposits at the beginning of the 2nd 
millennium AD. This is entirely consistent with the Late Iron Age roulette decorated 
ceramics that were found throughout the deposits in these caves and with the 
radiocarbon dating evidence from Nguri Cave and the Musanze Caves.  
8.31 Ceramic Analysis 
The specific research aims associated with the analysis of the ceramic assemblage 
were the same as those from Nguri Cave (e.g. to compare the results with those from 
the Musanze caves in order to establish if there is a material culture relationship 
between the past occupants of the caves in the north of Rwanda). 
Technological Profile 
The total ceramic assemblage recovered during excavations at Mweru Cave weighed 
21.8kg and there were eight fabrics identified within it (Fig. 8.116). These fabrics 
have been numbered 15R1  15R8 and this code relates to the site code for Mweru 
cave, RPS015.

Fig. 8.116 Table showing the physical properties of the fabric groups identified at Mweru Cave, RPS015  
Unlike the assemblages recovered from the other cave sites, a single fabric type did 
not overwhelmingly dominate the assemblage. The total excavated assemblage 
consisted of fabric 15R1 (25.5%), 15R2 (19.5%), 15R3 (3.5%), 15R4 (18%), 15R5 (0.5%), 
15R6 (6.5%), 15R7 (12%), 15R8 (1.5%) and miscellaneous (13%). With the exception of 
fabric 15R5 and 15R8 that are confined to specific deposits, all the fabrics occur 
throughout the sequence. Fabric 15R5 is particularly important because it is the same 
as fabric 3R7 from Nguri Cave and M5 from the Musanze Caves. It is comparable 
both technologically and stratigraphically, being limited to the later deposits [A1], 
[A2] and [A3] at Nguri Cave as at Musanze and Nguri Caves.  
Morphological Profile 
Thirty-two reconstructable vessels were identified within the total ceramic 
assemblage excavated from Mweru Cave. As in the other cave assemblages jars 
dominate (71%) (Fig. 8.117, b) with bowls making up the remainder (29%) (Fig. 
8.118). Although few in number, it is significant that fabric 15R5 is restricted to 
closed bowls. The related fabric groups M5 and 3R7 were also restricted to bowls 
and most commonly closed bowls.

rounded rim (a), a straight-necked jar (b) and two flat bases with raised interiors (c, d)

The rim form range from Mweru Cave (Fig. 8.119) was similar to that from Nguri 
and Musanze Caves and included rounded rims (44%), squared rims (22%), tapered 
rims (15.5%), folded rims (12.5%), beaded rims (3%) and thickened rims (3%). An 
analysis of the rim type relative to vessel form suggests that, in the better-
represented vessels, a variety of rims forms were applied to each vessel form. Again 
this is similar to the results from the assemblages from the other caves.

Fig. 8.120 Graph showing reconstructable vessel opening diameters from Mweru Cave (RPS015) 
The vessel opening diameter estimates from Mweru Cave are very similar to those 
from the other caves demonstrating a similar range with most vessels from the 14 to 
25cm openings but are not related to form (Fig. 8.120). 
The decorative range from Mweru cave was almost totally limited to twistedstring 
roulette-decorated samples. There was only one reconstuctable vessel identified with 
knotted-strip roulette decoration, which was recovered from context [A2], whilst the 
remaining thirty-one vessels, found throughout the sequence, were decorated with 
twisted-string. Within the total excavated ceramic assemblage from Mweru cave 
there were only six knotted-strip roulette-decorated sherds and these were recovered 
from the three most recent deposits [A1], [A2] and [A3]. This can be compared to 
two hundred and fifty-seven sherds identified with twisted-string roulette 
decoration occurring throughout the stratigraphic sequence. Within the total 
assemblage there was also an interesting sherd with incision decoration that was 
recovered from the earliest context [A6] (Fig. 8.117, a). This was the only incised 
sherd to be recovered from any of the Late Iron Age contexts encountered during 
this research. Unfortunately, whilst it is intriguing and is roughly similar with non-
Classic Urewe incised wares from Karama and Masangano, in the absence of further 
material, it is not possible to explore this occurrence further. An analysis of the angle 
of decoration of twisted-string rouletting shows a slight preference for the left (66%) 
but is generally split equally between the vessel forms (Fig. 8.121). Unusually, 
compared to the assemblages from Nguri Cave and the Musanze Caves the black 
burnished ware did not display any horizontal rouletting, however this fabric at 
Mweru is only represented by two reconstructable vessels, one of which does not 
show any decoration. Decoration across the total assemblage is most commonly seen 
on the lip and neck but internal decoration does occur (Fig. 8.122).

The only example of surface treatment in the reconstructable assemblage from 
Mweru cave comes from the black burnished ware. Four bases were also identified 
within the assemblage: a simple flat base, a flat base with a raised inner and a conical 
shaped base were recovered from the earliest deposit [A7] (Fig 8.117, c, d). In the 
following context [6] there was another conical base and a flat base with raised inner. 
There were also four handles recovered from the excavations, all were decorated 
with twisted-string roulette decoration. One was found in the earliest context [A7] 
and was formed from a single vertical clay band (Fig. 8.119), another was found in 
context [A3] made of three vertical clay bands, two from context [A2], one with a 
double band and one with a single band.

8.32 Zooarchaeological Analysis 
The first context encountered [A1] produced a small zooarchaeological sample 
including only thirteen unidentified fragments and eight Bovid Size Class 3 
specimens, one with knife-cut marks (Fig. 8.124).

The zooarchaeological assemblage from context [A2] increased significantly in size 
from the previous context (Fig. 8.125). This assemblage included thirty-eight 
unidentified bone fragments; eight Bovid Size Class 5 specimens, two with knife-cut 
marks; eight Bovid Size Class 4 specimens; nineteen Bovid Size Class 3 specimens; 
two Bovid Size Class 1 specimens; two bird specimens; and one wild pig (suidae) 
specimen. Five cattle (Bos taurus) specimens, two with knife-cut marks, one with 
puncture marks and two with burning; and four sheep/goat (Ovicaprine) specimens 
derived from at least three individuals, one with knife-cut marks; and one chicken 
(Gallus gallus) specimen, represent the domestic assemblage from this context. The 
identified wild assemblage included two bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus) specimens, 
one with burning and knife-cut marks, one duiker (Cephalophus) metacarpal and one 
white-bellied duiker (Cephalophus leucogaster) mandible.

The following context [A3] also contained a sizeable zooarchaeological assemblage, 
including ninety-two unidentified bone fragments, including: twenty-four Bovid 
Size Class 5 specimens, five with knife-cut marks and one with gnawing; three Bovid 
Size Class 4 specimens, one with knife cut marks; thirty-three Bovid Size Class 3 
specimens, five with knife cut marks, five with burning and one with puncture 
marks; one Bovid Size Class 2 specimen; three Bovid Size Class 1 specimens; one 
rodent specimen; and nine bird specimens (Fig. 8.126). The identified domestic 
assemblage included eight cattle (Bos taurus) specimens, from at least three 
individuals, three with knife cut marks and one burnt, one gnawed and one with 
chop marks; and six sheep/goat (Ovis/Capra) specimens, two with burning, one with 
gnawing and one with knife-cut marks. Whilst the sheep/goat specimens were all 
from mature individuals, the cattle specimens were from a range of immature and 
mature specimens. The identified wild assemblage contained five bushbuck 
(Tragelaphus scriptus) specimens, from at least two individuals, four with knife-cut 
marks and burning and one with puncture marks, four common duiker (Silvicapra 
grimmia) specimens, two with gnawing and one with knife-cut marks, one lion 
(Panthera leo) tibia, and two buffalo (Synerus caffer) lateral maleoli.

Fig. 8.126 Table showing the identified zooarchaeological assemblage from [A3] Mweru Cave 
The following context [A4] was again very rich in zooarchaeological specimens (Fig. 
8.127). This context contained thirty-six unidentified bone fragments; twenty-five 
Bovid Size Class 5 specimens, two with burning, five with knife-cut marks, one with 
gnawing and one with puncture marks; six Bovid Size Class 4 specimens; forty 
Bovid Size Class 3 specimens, ten with burning, one with knife-cut marks; one Bovid 
Size Class 2 specimen; one Bovid Size Class 1 specimen; one rodent specimen; one 
Lagomorph specimen; and nine bird specimens. The identified domestic assemblage 
included three sheep/goat (Ovis/Capra) specimens, one with burning and nineteen 
cattle (Bos taurus) specimens, six with knife-cut marks and two with chop marks. The 
sheep/goat and cattle remains came from a range of immature and mature 
individuals. The remaining wild assemblage consisted of one rock hyrax (Procavia 
capensis) humerus; one white-bellied duiker (Cephalophus leucogaster) scapula; two 
bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus) calcaneums; two duiker (Cephalophus) specimens; 
and one common duiker (Silvacapra grimmia) specimen.

The zooarchaeological assemblage size reduced in the following contexts. In context 
[A5] there were sixteen unidentified bone fragments; eight Bovid Size Class 5 
specimens, four with knife-cut marks; one Bovid Size Class 4 specimen; twelve 
Bovid Size Class 3 specimens, two with knife-cut marks and one with burning; two 
Bovid Size Class 1 specimens, one bird specimen; and one wild pig (Suidae) worked 
incisor (Fig. 8.128). The domestic assemblage contained both cattle (Bos taurus) and 
sheep/goat (Ovis/Capra) specimens. There were four cattle specimens from two 
individuals both from immature individuals, and four sheep/goat specimens from 
at least two individuals both immature and mature. There was only one other 
specimen from this context a bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus) first phalange (Fig. 
8.125).

Fig. 8.131 Table showing the identified zooarchaeological assemblage from [A7] Mweru Cave 
Summary 
The zooarchaeological assemblage from Mweru Cave, RPS015, is broadly consistent 
with the remains recovered from all of the other caves. Throughout all of the 
archaeological deposits there were wild remains alongside domestic remains and 
again a variety of age ranges have been exploited. 
8.33 Palaeobotanical Analysis 
Palaeobotanical samples were taken from every deposit encountered during the 
excavations at Mweru Cave. However, none of these samples returned any 
palaeobotanical remains. Whilst this may reflect the absence of grain use by the Late 
Iron Age occupants of the cave it is also likely that this reflects poor preservation 
conditions.  
8.34 Other Finds 
A range of other finds was also recovered from the excavations at Mweru Cave. In 
the most recent context [A1] there was a worked bone with perforations at each end 
(Fig. 8.132), a thin metal bracelet, a small metal point and an iron hook. There were 
no finds from context [A2]. The following context [A3] contained a small spearhead 
and an iron blade (Fig. 8.133). Context [A4] contained two white shell beads and 
brown bone bead. The next context [A5] contained three white bone beads, an 
oblong white bead and a brown bead. In the earliest archaeological context [A6] 
there was an iron point, two large iron objects, one projectile point, possibly a 
spearhead (Fig. 8.134) and four and a half white shell beads (Fig 8.135).

8.35 Summary  
The excavations at Mweru Cave produced a similar dated assemblage to the other 
cave. The earliest context was dated to the beginning 2nd millennium AD, as were all 
the previous caves. The cave also contained a large assemblage of twisted-string 
roulette decorated ceramics including a fine black burnished ware in the later 
deposits that was also identified at the Musanze Caves and Nguri Cave. The 
zooarchaeological assemblage also demonstrated that domestic species were utilised 
alongside more frequent wild species.  
8.36 Northern Rwanda Conclusions 
The northern excavations were very successful as they encountered both 1st 
millennium AD deposits at Masangano and a variety of 2nd millennium AD deposits 
in the Virunga Caves. The earliest of these deposits were successfully radiocarbon 
dated producing the first ever radiocarbon date for Masangano, and a series of dates 
for the caves that will help this thesis to explore the suggestion that roulette-
decorated ceramics appeared in Rwanda in the late 1st millennium AD (e.g. Van 
Noten 1983) (see discussion Chapter 9 section 9.4 and section 9.14). 
The ceramic analysis identified a mixed assemblage from Masangano including 
Classic Urewe, incised and impressed non-Urewe ceramics and a boudin ceramic. 
The ceramic analysis from the caves explored the potential for ceramic patterns 
within the roulette-decorated assemblages and successfully identified a discrete 
ceramic type, named here black burnished ware with a fine twisted-string roulette-
decoration that was stratigraphically confined to the latest cave deposits. 
There were no subsistence remains identified at Masangano. However, the cave 
excavations identified large zooarchaeological assemblages and a variety of 
palaeobotanical remains. These finds suggest that the cave occupants were 
maximising the available subsistence sources and strategies utilising both domestic 
and wild resources. However, the predominance of wild remains alongside the 
hunting implements suggests that the cave occupants were primarily involved with 
hunting (see Chapter 9 section 9.20 onwards).  
The northern results, along with the southern and central results, will now be 
contextualised in detail within this research and extant debates in Rwandan and 
Great Lakes Africa archaeology in Chapter 9.  
Chapter 9 
Contextualising the Results 
Chapters 6, 7 and 8 presented the results of the fieldwork and analyses of this 
research grouped within geographic case studies. This chapter will now 
contextualise these results within Iron Age archaeological debates introduced in 
Chapter 4. It will also directly address the research questions identified in that 
chapter. This will be achieved under the following headings: economy and culture in 
the Early Iron Age; Late Iron Age transition and its broader relevance; and cave 
dwelling and cultural diversity in the 2nd millennium AD: an alternative history. 
The ten radiocarbon dates produced by this research, combined with ceramic 
typological evidence, suggest that the excavated deposits represent three distinct 
phases within the Iron Age (Figs. 9.1 and 9.2). The dates from Masangano (OxA-
19520) and Kabusanze (OxA-19517; OxA-19518; OxA-19583) fall firmly within the 
Early Iron Age and are associated with Classic Urewe ceramics (although the two 
assemblages are distinct in the range of vessel forms and decoration they include) 
(Clist 1987: 43; Van Grunderbeek 1992: 63). The single date from Karama (OxA-
19519) places the pit feature towards the terminal 1st millennium AD, within the 
archaeological hiatus (discussed in Chapter 4 section 4.2), and the ceramics have 
similarities with devolved Urewe (e.g. Posnansky et al. 2005). Finally, the dates from 
the earliest deposits in the caves in northern Rwanda (OxA-19521; OxA-19522; OxA-
19523; OxA-19524; OxA-19811) all fall at the start of the 2nd millennium in the Late 
Iron Age and are associated with roulette-decorated ceramics.

9.1 Culture and Economy in the Early Iron Age 
This section deals with the research results from Kabusanze and Masangano that 
have been dated to the early-mid 1st millennium AD and will contextualise the 
ceramics, subsistence remains and burial data within Rwanda and Great Lakes 
Africa.  
9.2 Early Iron Age Ceramic Variation  
Related research questions: How can Urewe be defined? Is Urewe a homogenous 
ceramic type or can meaningful variation be identified within it? 
The ceramic assemblage from Kabusanze was entirely made up of Classic Urewe 
and has been dated to the Early Iron Age, 5th to 6th centuries AD. In comparison, 
whilst some of the ceramics from Masangano fit a broad classification for Urewe and 
have been dated to the 3rd to 6th century AD, well within the accepted date range of 
the Early Iron Age, the assemblage from Masangano does not fit the typical Classic 
Urewe typology. This section will discuss these differences and their context within 
a broader regional understanding of Early Iron Age ceramics and will continue to 
demonstrate that whilst Urewe is a regionally unified ceramic it also contains much 
meaningful variation at both a site and inter-site level.  
9.3 Kabusanze 
The ceramics from Kabusanze, discussed in detail in Chapter 6 (section 6.4), are 
made up of seven fabrics with fabric B1 being responsible for 83% of the assemblage. 
There were 62 reconstructable vessels recovered from Early Iron Age contexts at 
Kabusanze covering eight forms with jars representing 38% of the assemblage and a 
range of bowls accounting for the remaining 62%. Bevelled rims, including both 
complex (greater than 3) and simple, dominated the rim types (88%) with the 
remainder made up of rounded and squared rims. Overall jars showed the greatest 
input of effort with 95% of the examples showing complex bevelling and 97% of jars 
receiving decoration, the majority of which was cross-hatching.  
Whilst the overall range of vessel types, decorative features, and fabric were 
consistent with Classic Urewe found in Rwanda and Burundi and the neighbouring 
regions (e.g. Hiernaux and Maquet 1957, 1960; Posnansky 1961b; Nenquin 1967a, 
1971; Meulemeester and Waleffe 1973; Van Noten 1983; Van Grunderbeek 1988; 
Ashley 2005) the distribution of forms and effort investment are in contrast to those 
found by Van Grunderbeek (1988: 12) and Ashley (2005). Their multi-variant 
analyses suggested that jars were the most frequent vessel form, (60%) but that 
bowls received the most effort-investment, based on decoration and rim complexity, 
whilst the jars were made of coarser fabrics, had simpler rims and received less 
decorative investment. Ashley (2005: 174) suggests, based on her results from 
Entebezamikusa, that this is related to socio-functional applications. For example, 
the more public role of bowls, such as in serving, makes them more visible and thus 
imbues them with greater social meaning unlike the jars which were used for storage 
or pouring and thus had a more utilitarian status. For example jars are associated 
with liquid storage, such as water, milk or beer whereas bowls are linked with 
serving and consumption and whilst jars are the most frequent vessel form at 
Entebezamikusa they have the least energy invested. However, if similar reasoning 
were to be applied to the Kabusanze material it would indicate that the jars were the 
socially imbued vessels whilst the bowls were less socially valued and were more 
utilitarian. Jars are the most frequent vessels represented at Kabusanze but they have 
the most effort invested. Thus, suggesting a different way of life or set of values at 
Kabusanze. Ashley (2005: 174) suggests that the storage of liquids is clearly 
functionally important at Entebezamikusa and central to Early Iron Age existence 
but isnt as symbolically or socially important as serving because it is not as visible. 
Therefore, perhaps at Kabusanze either storage was a more visible activity, was a 
more important activity, or there was a different set of standards that, for example, 
valued private, or less-visible, space and objects over the public more visible ones. 
Thus, the ceramic results from Kabusanze support Ashleys (2005: 290) conclusions 
regarding the potential of a chine opratoire, multi-variant approach to Urewe 
ceramics in contrast to Van Grunderbeeks (1988) more limited findings. Van 
Grunderbeeks (1988) analysis of the Urewe ceramics from Rwanda and Burundi 
established that although variation exists within Urewe it is too diverse, being 
geographically and temporally unpredictable, to identify meaningful sub-divisions 
at a macro-scale. However, by analysing for local, site based scales of variation and 
by contextualising these within broader interpretations of the site, Ashley (2005: 284) 
has identified meaningful variation, that through comparative analysis may help to 
identify socio-functional distinctions between sites as proposed here.  
9.4 Masangano 
Related research questions: Is Urewe a homogenous ceramic type or can 
meaningful variation be identified within it? What happened to Urewe at the end 
of the Early Iron Age? 
At Masangano the Early Iron Age ceramic picture, described in detail in Chapter 8 
(section 8.5), is quite different to the examples already discussed. Whilst previous 
work at the site has identified a range of Classic Urewe sherds from jars and bowls, 
with complex bevelled rims, dimpled bases and incised motifs (Hiernaux and 
Maquet 1960; Nenquin 1967a; Van Noten 1983), the excavations during this research 
encountered a much more diverse assemblage. A single fabric dominated the 
analysed assemblage from Masangano and the technological profile was generally to 
similar to that identified at Kabusanze. However, the morphological profile at 
Masangano differs to that encountered at Kabusanze. For example, jars accounted 
for only 15% of the assemblage at Masngano, with the remainder bowls, 
representing a sever reduction in the frequency of this form compared to Kabusanze 
(although the size of the assemblage here is quite small, which may have introduced 
error). There is also an overall reduction in effort investment at Masangano 
compared to Kabusanze. For example, at Masnangano, unexpectedly in an Early 
Iron Age context associated with Urewe, rounded rims (67%) and not bevelled rims 
(19%) dominate and there were no complex bevelled rims. Furthermore, decoration 
applied less and the decorative range is also distinct. Whilst incised cross-hatching, 
rocker stamping, linear punctates and stab-drag consistent with Classic Urewe exist, 
there were also boudin and fingernail impressed ceramics (Figs. 8.14 to 8.17). 
Within the incised group there were multiple examples of fingernail impressed 
sherds, herringbone incision, crosshatching, incised triangular and circular motifs. 
Although some published illustrated ceramics from Masangano (e.g. Hiernaux and 
Maquet 1957; Nenquin 1967a: 269; Van Noten 1983: Plates 36 and 37) fit well with the 
established typology for Classic Urewe the excavated assemblage encountered 
during this research did not. The previously published assemblages demonstrate the 
presence of Classic Urewe styles such as a range of bevelled rims, both complex and 
simple, a restricted fabric range, with a range of vessel forms and incised geometric 
motifs. However, there were no complex bevels in the excavated assemblage 
encountered by this research, very few jars and a highly variable range of 
decoration, elements of which, such as boudin application and fingernail 
impressions, are unexpected on Classic Urewe ceramics (for a finger nail exception 
see the material from Ruhimangyargya, Nenquin 1967a: 258). Furthermore, the 
application of some of the incised decoration was of a very poor standard compared 
to Classic Urewe vessels. Thus, the assemblage from Masangano cannot be 
accounted for by a Classic Urewe typology alone and is clearly distinct from the 
Early Iron Age assemblage identified at Kabusanze. Therefore the ceramic anomalies 
that form the Masangano assemblage, such as the appearance of boudin application 
must be addressed.  
Fig. 9.3 Illustration showing boudin open vessel from Kabuye, Rwanda (reproduced from Van Noten 
1983: Plate 11) 
Fig. 9.4 Illustration showing boudin ceramic from Kabuye V, Rwanda (reproduced from Van Noten 
1983: Plate 22) 
Hiernaux and Maquet (1960: 51) identified distinct decoration in Rwanda at 
Nyirankuba and named it boudin ware and Van Noten (1983: Plates 11 & 22) 
identified similar decoration at Kabuye (Figs. 9.3 and 9.4), although he did not 
connect it with boudin ware. This decorative type has also been identified outside 
of Rwanda in Uganda in the Chobi sector of Murchisons Falls, where Soper (1971b: 
60-63) called it Chobi Ware but noted its relationship to Hiernaux and Maquets 
(1960: 51) boudin ware and Chapman (1967: 21-22) has also found boudin ceramics 
at Kanysore Island, southwest Uganda. Significantly, in all these examples boudin 
has been identified in association with Urewe. For example, at Murchinsons Falls 
Soper (1971: 85) found it in stratigraphic association with Urewe at Site 14A and at 
Nyirankuba, Hienaux and Maquet (1957: 51-52, 96-97) noted its typological 
association with Urewe within a surface assemblage that included Classic Urewe 
through the identification of bevelled rims on some examples and the consistent use 
of the same fabric for both Urewe and boudin examples. There have also been 
suggestions that boudin existed into the Late Iron Age, for example, Soper (1971b: 
85) tentatively identified it at Kibiro. However, later work by Connah (1997: 49) has 
ruled this out. Posnansky (1968b: 2) identified a boudin application in the Late Iron 
Age deposits at Bweyorere but Soper (1971b: 63) disregards the cultural association 
between these and his Chobi Ware sites based on the considerable difference in paste 
and chronological separation. Finally, Chapman (1967: 21-23) identified boudin 
alongside roulette-decoration on individual sherds. However, she disassociated her 
boudin with that of Hiernaux and Maquet (1960) because of its dissimilar fabric 
believing her material to be more comparable to Posnanskys (1968b) Late Iron Age 
boudin from Bweyorere (Chapman 1967: 21). Thus, on present evidence there 
appears to be at least two non-associated boudin types in Great Lakes Africa, one 
that is associated with Urewe and another much later occurrence associated within 
the Kingdom Era. 
The identification of boudin in the excavated assemblage at Masangano may help 
explain the high percentage of bowls in the overall assemblage. For example, 
boudin is only found on bowl forms at Masangano, and in all the other sites 
discussed here, and its presence within the assemblage is likely to have over 
emphasised the use of bowls at the site. The radiocarbon date taken for the 
settlement horizon at Masangano is believed to be the first absolute date to be 
generated for boudin. Whilst its relationship with Urewe has been established 
(Soper 1971b: 86), finer dating has been more difficult, leading Connah (1997: 49) to 
simply state that it may be a pre-roulette style. This research further supports its 
association with Urewe, its lack of association with roulette-decorated wares, and 
whilst not being able to expand on its full date range, does suggest that the ceramic 
was present in north-west Rwanda between the 3rd to 6th centuries AD. 
Unfortunately, more extensive explorations of the nature and definition of boudin 
in Early Iron Age Urewe contexts have continued to be hampered because of the low 
frequency of the ceramic. For example, only three reconstructable boudin vessels 
were found at Masangano, two at Kabuye (Van Noten 1983: 13, 15 and Plates 11 & 
22), twenty-eight sherds at Nyirankuba, one at Kiruhura (Hiernaux and Maquet 
1960: 51, 55) and thirty-three sherds at eleven sites during Connahs (1997: 45) work 
around Chobi region, and an unspecified but small number of sherds from the same 
area found by Soper (1971b: 82). However, based on the present evidence two clear 
features of boudin can be identified. Firstly, boudin is always applied to 
hemispherical or open bowls and second, it is always made from the same fabric as 
the Classic Urewe vessels that it is found in association with. The first of these 
suggests a functional association for boudin and the secondly that it was made by 
the same potters that made the Urewe ceramics, as suggested by Hiernaux and 
Maquet (1960: 51), and not by separate populations, as suggested by Soper (1971b: 
Although the identification of boudin ware in the excavated assemblage from 
Masangano helps to explain some of the variation identified within the assemblage it 
is not sufficient to account for all of the ceramic anomalies. For example, if the 
boudin and Classic Urewe sherds are removed, the remaining assemblage includes 
a large variety of poorly executed incised decorations and simplistic rim forms. 
Thus, there are at least three distinct sub-divisions within the ceramics excavated at 
Masangano: a Classic Urewe, boudin and a separate incised ware. Similar non-
Urewe-incised wares or C-Ware ceramics have previously been identified within 
Rwanda at the sites of Masangano (Fig 4.10), Bugarama (Fig. 4.11), Kiguhu (Fig. 
4.12), Mutwarubona II, Kabuye II (Fig. 4.13) and Kabuye XV (Hiernaux and Maquet 
1960; Nenquin 1967a: 284; Van Noten 1983; Van Grunderbeek 1992) (see Chapter 4 
section 4.5). However, radiocarbon dates are only available for some of these sites 
and those that are available place these ceramics in the terminal 1st millennium AD, 
beyond the latest margin for the excavated assemblage from Masangano. 
Ashley (2005), Posnansky et al. (2005) and Reid and Ashley (2007), have identified 
localised processes of devolution within Urewe ceramics during this later period 
(discussed in Chapter 4 section 4.5 and again later in this chapter section 9.15 
onwards). Within that model, although the detail of devolution is unique to each 
local area or site, the general process is comparable. For example, there is a lessening 
of investment in complex forms and decoration and a general reduction in the 
overall quality of the ceramic. This is broadly comparable to the excavated 
assemblage at Masangano where complex bevelled rims are non-existent and simple 
bevelled rims are rare compared to simple rounded types. Furthermore, the 
execution of the decorative styles is much poorer than in Classic Urewe, although it 
is notable that, like the boudin material the fabric does not differ greatly from the 
Classic Urewe examples found. Therefore, supporting the suggestion that these were 
all made by people familiar with similar clay sources and production traditions, such 
as mixing.  
Unfortunately, the assemblage from Masangano is too small to make a confident 
association between devolved Urewe and the incised non-Classic Urewe. 
Nevertheless, the occurrence of these three ceramic groups within a single deposit 
needs explanation. Devolved Urewe as defined by Ashley (2005) and Posnansky et 
al. (2005) is a post-Urewe ceramic, dated to the terminal 1st millennium AD 
archaeological hiatus. However, if the identification of it at Masangano, postulated 
here, is correct then it occurs in the same deposit as Classic Urewe and boudin that 
are presumed to be earlier. One possibility is that the deposit formed over a long 
period of time leading to the incorporation of both earlier and later styles in one 
mixed deposit. However, the deposit is stratigraphically distinct and relatively thin, 
all factors that do not suggest sustained formation from the mid to late 1st 
millennium AD. Furthermore, this explanation falls into the same conceptual trap 
identified in Chapter 4 (section 4.1) where archaeological adaptations follow 
chronological frameworks instead of influencing the framework. Alternatively, the 
assemblage may represent deposition of various related ceramic traditions by 
separate groups at the same location, perhaps encouraged by Masanganos position 
at the confluence of two major rivers, in an extremely fertile zone at a geographic 
crossroads. Indeed, Ashley (2005) has identified contemporary non-Classic Urewe 
ceramics at Usenge 3 that she calls Contact Urewe (also see Lane 2007 et al.) (see 
Chapter 4, section 4.4.). However, in the absence of further supporting 
archaeological material, such as subsistence remains, a larger ceramic assemblage, or 
more dates, such as direct dates from ceramic inclusions, it is not possible to develop 
these arguments further. Nevertheless, it is clear that these ceramics are related 
although the nature of that relation is yet to be established.  
9.5 Early Iron Age Subsistence Economy: Some Empirical Contributions  
In many respects the palaeobotanic and zooarchaeological remains recovered during 
this research for sites relating to Urewe users are extremely limited. For example, no 
subsistence remains were recovered from Masangano and only rare charred seed 
remains were identified at Kabusanze. However, in the absence of any direct 
palaeobotanical evidence for domestic crops during this period in Rwanda and 
much of Great Lakes Africa the dated remains identified here are believed to be very 
significant.  
9.6 Kabusanze 300-600 AD: farming 
There is linguistic evidence for the exploitation of cattle in the Early Iron Age 
(Schoenbrun 1998: 74), and limited archaeological evidence, a single cattle tooth from 
a 3rd century AD iron production context from Remera, Rwanda (Van Noten 1983: 
20, 77). Unfortunately this research failed to recover any faunal remains from 
Kabusanze and so cannot add to our understanding of Early Iron Age herding. 
However, the palaeobotanical analysis did identify rare charred sorghum (Sorghum 
bicolor) and pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) seeds from two of the dated contexts 
(Fig. 9.5).  
Site Name Sample  Context Type Specimens Date 
Kabusanze 12 Large pit fill Sorgum  425  573 AD 
 11 Small pit fill Pearl millet 263  538 AD 
Fig. 9.5 Table showing a summary of the palaeobotanical results from Kabusanze 
There is a range of indirect evidence for agriculture in the Early Iron Age, such as the 
prevalence of sites located in environmentally advantageous areas such as the hills 
on the central plateau, environmental degradation on Kabuye hill east of Butare 
(Van Grunderbeek and Roche 2007), and linguistic evidence for the use of cereals 
and cultivation (Ehret 1998: 127-130; Schoenbrun 1998: 72). However, there is only 
limited direct evidence for agriculture during the Early Iron Age and the results 
from Karama represent the first, and thus the earliest, charred seed remains of 
domestic cereal crops in Rwanda. The only other direct evidence for agriculture in 
the Early Iron Age comes from pollen analysis conducted by Van Grunderbeek and 
Roche (2007: 306-307) from Kabuye IV (240-400 cal AD (Oxcal, 95.4%); III 420-600 cal 
AD (Oxcal, 95.4%), and Kabuye II 560-690 cal AD (Oxcal 95.4%) where pollen spectra 
at all three sites contained cereal pollen. Van Grunderbeek and Roche (2007: 306-307) 
identified part of the Gramineae pollen at Kabuye IV to finger millet (Elusine 
coracana) and similarly in Kabuye III and Kabuye II, and sorghum (Sorgum bicolor) at 
Kabuye IV and Kabuye III. Unlike other pollen data these results are not believed to 
be intrusive because they were collected from within sealed iron furnace bases and 
in the case of Kabuye II came from a pot interred beneath a furnace. Based on the 
low frequency of their pollen results, 2-3%, Van Grunderbeek and Roche (2007: 307) 
suggest that, small plots were probably devoted to cereal cultivation, initially of 
Eleusine, a very fire-resistant African cereal that benefits from slash-and-burn 
preparation of the plot, and subsequently sorghum.  
Although these cereal crops are believed to have originated in Africa, the evidence 
suggests that they were not domesticated in Great Lakes Africa. Instead their 
appearance in that region has been associated with Urewe users (Van Grunderbeek 
and Roche 2007: 307). Early finds of domesticated sorghum include Kawa in Nubia 
from before 500 BC and several in greater Nubia from the last centuries BC and first 
centuries AD (Fuller 2004, 2005). There is early evidence of pearl millet exploitation 
in West Africa dated to the first half of the 2nd millennium BC (cultivation) and later 
fully domesticated millet cultivation at Tichit sites. There is also early evidence of 
domesticated pearl millet from Dhar Nema, Mauritania from the mid 1st and mid 2nd 
millennium BC (Fuller et al. 2007: 71-76). Thus, the evidence from Kabusanze does 
not alter our understanding of the early appearance of cereal crops in sub-Saharan 
Africa but the much later results from Kabusanze continue to support the association 
of agriculture with the Early Iron Age and with Urewe in Great Lakes Africa. Whilst 
these finds consist of only a few charred seeds, in the absence of good preservation 
conditions over much of Great Lakes Africa (Young and Thompson 1999), they are 
very important. Unfortunately, considering preservation conditions, it appears that 
only by patiently testing for and collecting rare evidence piece by piece will 
archaeology be able to re-construct Early Iron Age subsistence in Great Lakes Africa.  
9.7 Funerary Practice in the Early Iron Age 
This chapter will now contextualise the Early Iron Age burial identified at 
Kabusanze (Chapter 6 section 6.7). Whilst the identification of mortuary data was 
not a primary research objective of this research, the Early Iron Age Urewe burial 
from Kabusanze will help the research to explore more elements of the Iron Age in 
Rwanda and make a contribution to new perspectives regarding Rwandas pre-
colonial past.  
The Early Iron Age burial identified and excavated at Kabusanze in southern 
Rwanda, during this research, represents a unique Urewe burial. Whilst another 
similar burial has been encountered (Misago and Shumbusho 1992), this is the first to 
be identified in Rwanda, the first in Great Lakes Africa to be radiocarbon dated and 
the earliest to include an exotic artefact alongside a range of near complete vessels 
and iron objects. However, the deliberate deposition of Urewe ceramics is not 
unique and is a reoccurring feature noted since the first formal identification of 
Urewe at Siaya (Leakey et al. 1948). Thus, this section will not only contextualise the 
burial remains within the extant data for Iron Age burials in Rwanda and 1st 
millennium AD burials more further afield but will also contexualise the exotic 
cowrie shell within the extant evidence for long-distance trade in central Africa 
before describing how the deliberate deposition of Urewe at Kabusanze compares to 
that at other sites such as Siaya in Kenya (Leakey et al. 1948) and Lolui in Uganda 
(Posnansky et al. 2005). 
9.8 Summary of Kabusanze Burial Data 
The burial has been described in detail in Chapter 6 (section 6.7) but the salient 
results are summarised here. The burial contained two skeletons, one of an adult and 
one of a neonate, situated approximately 0.5m above the adult in the burial shaft. 
Whilst the infant burial was well preserved and is almost complete adult skeleton 
was only partially represented, consisting of the mandible, maxilla, a broken 
humerus, upper vertebrae and a few ribs. Based on these remains the neonate is 
believed to have survived birth but by no more than a few weeks. Unfortunately the 
death of the adult cannot be estimated although it appears to have reached 
anatomical maturity. It has not been possible to attribute a sex to the infant but based 
on the robust mandible the adult is believed to have been male. The adult had a 
variety of dental pathological conditions, including a large abscess, dental decay and 
infection, however, none that can be suggested to have caused death. (For more 
details please see the specialist report, Appendix 1). Charcoal was identified in 
association with the adult human remains and a sample of this was dated to c.400 
The lack of most of the adults post-cranial skeleton initially suggested poor 
preservation conditions. However, the relatively well-preserved cranial elements 
and humerus argue against this. It is not believed that this is the result of secondary 
burial because the upper body was placed in a broadly anatomical position, 
including ribs, and was surrounded by grave goods, also it is not believed to be the 
product of later disturbance and robbing because the grave is sealed 
stratigraphically by the large Urewe filled pit above it, dated to the same period. 
Furthermore, the infant skeleton was found approximately 0.5m above the adult 
skeleton so there seems no reason why the adult would be disturbed even if the 
infant were buried significantly later within the Early Iron Age. Thus it is believed 
that the complete adult skeleton was not interred. This is supported by evidence of 
defleshing and decapitation on the humerus and mandible, along with a post-
mortem fracture on the humerus. Thus, in the absence of other evidence, it is 
tentatively suggested here that the individual either suffered a violent death or was 
modified after death but before burial, during which time the skeleton became 
incomplete. Without more comparable graves it is not possible to comment further 
on the significance of this.  
Around the burial were located a series of ten near complete Urewe vessels and one 
complete one, from the full range of vessel forms, creating a ceramic set. These pots 
showed a clear fabric selection preference with ten out of eleven vessels coming from 
a single fabric. To the side of the ceramic and bone concentration of the adult burial 
there were also four iron objects, believed to be a necklet, two bracelets, and a disc 
shaped object, a quartz flake, shell beads and a cowrie shell (Figs. 6.38 to 6.40). The 
cowrie shell is of particular importance because the nearest source for this object is 
the Indian Ocean at the east African coast or the west coast of central Africa, and 
thus this object may represent the earliest known long-distance exchange artefact in 
the central African interior.   
9.9 Great Lakes Africa and Central Africa Early Burials 
Thus, this burial is believed to be unique within the context of the Early Iron Age in 
Rwanda. However, other burials have been excavated in the region, that broadly 
date to this period and these will be discussed here. The most comparable burial 
comes from Tongo in eastern DRC close to the border with Rwanda. The burial was 
excavated by Misago and Shumbusho (1992: 66-71) and was part of a larger 
necropolis consisting of approximately 60 skeletons. Unfortunately only one of these 
was archaeologically excavated, the others, and indeed the site, having been found 
and mechanically excavated during the construction of a road. The burial goods 
from the archaeologically excavated burial included two iron rings, one on the right 
leg of an adult skeleton and one on the left leg with a decorated Urewe pot fragment 
above the right knee, interred at a depth of approximately 2m (Misago and 
Shumbusho 1992: 70-71). Significantly, they also found an infant burial, in the same 
cut, approximately 1m above the adult, without any grave goods. Furthermore, the 
base of the grave cut was carved into the limestone bedrock below, being 
deliberately cut to make a cavity for the body. Thus, there are clear similarities 
between the Tongo burial and the Kabusanze burial; including the adorned adult 
and the unadorned infant, the inclusion of Urewe ceramics and iron rings and finally 
the carved cavity for the adult corpse. Unfortunately, further comparison is hindered 
because the Tongo burial was very briefly published. For example, it included no 
aging, sexing or pathology evidence and there were no illustrations or radiocarbon 
dates generated, although charcoal was present with the burial. However, the clear 
parallels between the graves suggest at least an anecdotal burial pattern by Urewe 
users in this locality, which indicates, very speculatively, that there was more social 
and symbolic connections between Urewe users than simply sharing a ceramic 
tradition.  
The Tongo and Kabusanze burials are the only Urewe burials known of in this 
region. However, in southeast DRC another necropolis has been identified that has 
some broadly comparable features. The site of Sanga was first excavated by Nenquin 
(1963), followed by Hiernaux and Buyst (1971), and finally by de Maret (1977, 1985, 
1992). De Maret also excavated comparable neighbouring sites at Katongo, 
Kamilamba, Kikulu and Malemba-Nkulu. In total 176 burials have been excavated at 
Sanga and these have been associated with three successive ceramic periods, the 
Ancient Kisalian, 8th - 10th century, the Classic Kisalian, 11th - 14th century, and the 
Kabambian 15th - 18th century (de Maret 1977: 328). Whilst these graves are later than 
the grave identified at Kabusanze and have other differences, such as the far greater 
number of grave goods in the Classic Kisalian graves, this necropolis is important 
here because it represents the greatest body of burial data from the Iron Age in the 
wider region. Furthermore, despite these differences there are important, but 
limited, similarities that should be highlighted. For example, the burials were filled 
with similar cultural materials including whole, well-made incised vessels, metal 
objects and beads. The grave goods from Sanga were also found arranged around 
and over the skeletons as they were at Kabusanze; and the tombs of children were 
numerous, even including the burials of children of premature birth (de Maret 1977: 
323). Of particular note is the occurrence of two cowrie shells within an unusually 
rich grave (grave 172), which contained at least forty-four vessels, numerous jewels 
of iron and copper and an ivory pendant (de Maret 1977: 325). This rich grave has 
been dated to 1100-1290 AD (Hv 6613) and was suggested to be the grave of a high 
status individual based on the grave goods, including the exotic shells. Before the 
cowrie find at Kabusanze, this was the earliest known occurrence of a cowrie shell in 
central Africa. Unfortunately, in the absence of more closely related comparative 
material it is not possible to assign status to the individual buried at Kabusanze.     
9.10 Rwandan Iron Age Burials 
Other archaeological burials from the Iron Age in Rwanda include the Late Iron Age 
burials excavated at Ruli in central Rwanda (Nenquin 1967a) and the royal graves 
excavated by Van Noten (1972; 1983). Whilst the royal graves are broadly 
typologically comparable, containing ceramics, metals, beads and shells they are 
chronologically isolated and have more subtle differences. For example, the 17th 
century grave of Cyirima Rujugira (Fig. 4.28) was far more richly adorned with a 
much greater variety of grave goods than seen at Kabusanze, whilst the late 19th and 
early 20th century graves of Kigeri Rwabugiri and Reine-Mere Nyirayuhi Kanjogera 
contained only two long necked roulette-decorated vases (Van Noten 1983: 38-48). 
Moreover, all of the royal grave shafts were oblong in plan, unlike the Kabusanze 
grave that was circular and cut into the underlying geology. Clearly the graves are 
also chronologically separate with the royal graves dating to the early 20th century 
(even though some of the grave goods from Cyirima Rujugira are believed to date to 
the 17th century) whilst the grave from Kabusanze has been dated to over a thousand 
years earlier. However, an important comparison is the occurrence of similar cowrie 
shell beads in the grave of Cyirima Rujugira and the arrangement of the metal rings 
in a similar position by the side of the lower body to those at Kabusanze (Van Noten 
1972: Plate XV).  
At Ruli a collective burial (Hiernaux and Maquet 1960; Nenquin 1967a: 278) was 
found in association with twisted-string roulette decorated ceramics (B-Ware) and 
thus has been dated typologically to the Late Iron Age. However, the pottery and 
burial was not archaeologically excavated, being recovered as part of a construction 
project, and the apparent association with the ceramics, along with the report, was 
communicated by a local priest who had observed workmen in the area, reducing 
confidence in the interpretation of this burial (Hiernaux and Maquet 1960: 12-16). 
Within the burial were found two vessels filled with sorghum and peas (Hiernaux 
and Maquet 1960: 14). This perhaps points to a very late 2nd millennium AD date 
because these organic materials would not be expected to survive very long in 
central African deposition conditions. At Kabusanze palaeobotanical analysis was 
undertaken of the fill of the base of the burial cut but no remains were found. (The 
fill of the whole small pot is still awaiting detailed palaeobotanical analysis). Thus, 
this grave is of little comparative value but has been included here as the only other 
known archaeological Iron Age grave in Rwanda, further demonstrating the 
empirical value of the Kabusanze grave. 
The discovery of the burial at Kabusanze raises two other important issues Firstly 
the potential of long-distance exchange in the Early Iron Age, at or before the 3rd - 6th 
centuries AD and secondly the continued deliberate deposition of Urewe ceramics as 
already noted at Tonga, but also at Lolui Island (Posnansky et al. 2005) and in 
western Kenya (Leakey et al. 1948).  
9.11 Long Distance Exchange in the Early Iron Age 
The single cowrie shell found in the Kabusanze burial, whilst of limited interpretive 
value due to its isolation and the lack of comparative material, is of great empirical 
value. For example, Vansina (1962: 376) has identified long-distance trade of cowrie 
shells in the 15th century AD recorded in central African histories, and there is earlier 
archaeological evidence for it at Sanga in the early 2nd millennium AD (see 
discussion above) and in Uganda at Ntusi (Reid 1990) and Kibiro (Connah 1996). 
Vansina  (1962) records how caravan traders moving between markets brought these 
exotic goods into the Central African interior in the 15th century AD. However, we 
have no information regarding their earlier movement. Yet, based on the find 
frequency it is possible to posit some suggestions. For example, only two cowrie 
shells have been found at Sanga out of 172 excavated graves (de Maret 1977), and the 
shell from Kabusanze is the first of its kind in an Early Iron Age Great Lakes Africa 
context, suggesting that these rare finds were a by-product of other small scale 
exchange events and not an intensive operation. Thus, the cowrie find indicates that 
down the line trade, reaching from central Africa either across to the coast of eastern 
Africa, or to the west coast of central Africa, was occurring as early as the 3rd - 6th 
centuries AD and that this exotic, rare, item was of significant symbolic importance 
because it was interred in a burial along with other objects of value, such as whole 
pots and iron adornments. Moreover, this evidence suggests that the later, more 
intensive, interest in the coastal products by the communities of the central African 
interior began much earlier, well within the 1st millennium AD and not the 2nd 
millennium AD as previously believed based on the 11th century evidence from 
Sanga (de Maret 1977: 325) and from other sites such as Ntusi where cowries were 
found in a 13th century context (Reid 1990: 27).  
Although this cowrie appears to be one of the earliest long distance trade artefacts 
found in Great Lakes Africa, it is not the earliest in the African interior. For example, 
Mutoro (1998) considered the evidence for long-distance exchange in pre-colonial 
east Africa and has identified cowrie shells, amongst other artefacts, found at a 
pastoral Neolithic site near Ngorongoro Crater, in Tanzania, as the earliest known 
long-distance exchange items in the interior of eastern Africa (Mutoro 1998: 190). 
Coastal objects have also been reported from Neolithic sites in Kenya, such as 
Nakuru (Leakey 1931: 281) and Hyrax Hill (Onyango-Abuje 1977) and from Pastoral 
Neolithic sites around Lake Turkana (cited in Mutoro 1998: 190). In the 1st 
millennium AD ceramics from the coast were also imported across eastern Africa, 
such as Kwale Ware (Soper 1967) and Tana Ware (Triangular Incised Ware) (Abungu 
1989 and Chami 1994 cited in Mutoro 1998: 190) and Mutoro (1998: 191) has linked 
this 1st millennium AD trade with the demand for slaves and ivory, and growing 
prosperity on the Swahili coast. Whilst the Swahili coast prosperity at the end of the 
1st millennium AD is too late to be a stimulus for the movement of the Kabusanze 
cowrie, it is possible that earlier trade in ivory and slaves may have had an influence.  
9.12 Urewe Deliberate Deposition 
The grave goods from the Kabusanze burial also represent an opportunity to study 
the deliberate deposition of material culture compared to the more common 
incidental deposition of archaeological remains as rubbish. The analyses of 
assemblages of ceramics that are the product of accidental or incidental deposition, 
have different interpretative limitations compared to those created by deliberate 
deposition. For example, some vessels are more likely to brake due to their 
manufacture or use, and these may be over-represented in domestic refuse 
assemblages and thus analysis of that assemblage may not accurately reflect the 
importance of particular vessel types. However, where vessels are deliberately 
deposited, even if the context of deposition biases the assemblage, it is possible to 
assess differing degrees of vessel importance within the worldviews of the users. 
This is particularly interesting in terms of Urewe ceramics where there are growing 
examples of deliberate deposition suggesting an important symbolic role for Urewe 
vessels in Early Iron Age societies, about whom we know very little.  
Leakey et al. (1948) were the first to formally describe Urewe (dimple-based) 
ceramics following their work at Siaya, western Kenya and within this area they 
regularly encountered Urewe ceramics interred in pits. For example, at Urewe I, the 
largest pot they discovered was situated in a pit, extending through two separate 
deposits and they concluded it had been purposely buried in that position (Leakey et 
al. 1948: 13). At Yala Alego were found three Urewe caches and based on the 
broken, but complete Urewe vessels, Leakey et al. (1948: 14) suggest they were 
deliberately buried whole. One of the caches was overlain with stones, and another 
had stones laid at its base. Although no interpretation was suggested for these stones 
it adds another deliberate element to the vessels deposition. Leakey et al. (1948: 14) 
also suggest that the site of Yala Alego would have had more caches but they believe 
the area to have been heavily eroded. Unfortunately, the site assemblages from Siaya 
have been discussed in their totality so the significance of the particular vessel forms 
interred cannot be developed further. 
Posnansky et al. (2005) have also identified potential deliberate deposition of Urewe 
ceramics at Lolui Island, Lake Victoria, Uganda. The high degree of deposition 
within rock nooks and crevices, which are too small to be living spaces, suggest that 
these ceramics must have been placed there deliberately (Ashley and Reid pers. 
comms. 2009). These sites are also associated with rock gongs (Chaplin 1974), an 
undated but prehistoric socially symbolic musical tradition (Posnansky et al. 2005: 
75). Unfortunately, little more can be interpreted about these undated deposits and 
their association with the poorly understood rock gongs remains tenuous, if 
intriguing.  
Finally, the most prominent example of the deliberate deposition of Urewe ceramics, 
outside of a burial context, is the interment of an Urewe medicine pot beneath a 
furnace at Kabuye, which had another sherd as a lid. The purpose of the pot is not 
clear but based on ethnographic evidence Van Noten (1983: 14) suggests that it may 
have held medicinal herbs that would have aided the fertility, and productivity, of 
the furnace. A similar small whole pot, without lid, was recovered from the 
Kabusanze burial at the base of the adult upper torso and the project is awaiting 
palaeobotanical results from the fill of that vessel. 
Contextualising the Kabusanze burial ceramic set within these examples continues 
to demonstrate that Urewe played more then a simply functional role in Early Iron 
Age society in Great Lakes Africa, that has already been indicated by the high 
technological effort investment seen in the complex bevelled rims and impressive 
abstract motifs. Furthermore, in the absence of Urewe houses, living floors and other 
social information, the analysis of deliberately deposited Urewe ceramics presents 
another opportunity to study symbolic and practical aspects of Urewe users lives. 
For, example, not only does the Kabusanze ceramic set demonstrate a symbolic 
Urewe value through its association with death, it may also reflect a more realistic 
proportion of vessels used or needed in domestic life because only one or two 
example of each Urewe vessel type found at Kabusanze was represented in the 
assemblage. It is definitely tempting, if highly speculative, to see this as a complete 
crockery set for an Early Iron Age individual.  
Unfortunately, Urewe sites are not generally known for preserving good contextual 
data and it seems likely that other examples of deliberate deposition may have been 
missed simply because of a lack of clear contextual data. 
9.13 Summary and Discussion 
Unfortunately there is a lack of comparative material for both the burial and the 
subsistence economic evidence from Kabusanze. However, it is believed that when 
taken together these archaeological materials have an important interpretative value. 
For example, the palaeobotanical remains suggest that the Urewe users at 
Kabusanze had access to cultivated domestic cereal grains. However, far from 
creating a stable food source for the population, the adult skeletal remains suggest 
that there were at least times of extreme nutritional deficiency (see Appendix 1). For 
example, the pathologies associated with adult dentition, such as the caries, indicate 
times of scarce resources in childhood. However, this individual received a complex 
and potentially rich, high status burial, suggesting that he was of sufficient status in 
life to have access to the same food supply as the majority of the community. Thus, 
this evidence of nutritional hardship may help to explain why foraging practices 
were retained alongside new mixed farming strategies such as small stock raising 
and agriculture (see Chapter 4 section 4.10) as communities sought to avoid risks 
associated with crop failure. Suggesting that the successful transition to farming in 
Great Lakes Africa was not always simple but could be a long complicated process 
of risk management.  
The burial also has wider implications within the presentation of this proposed by 
historical linguistic studies. For example, Schoenbrun (1998: 114) has proposed that 
this period of greater technological expertise, attested by specialised smelters and 
ceramicists, must have been supported by surpluses in agricultural produce 
(although technological specialists may have practised their crafts seasonally when 
work in the fields was minimal). This he suggests has implications for 
understanding growing concepts of wealth, and in turn power, and group cohesion 
during this period. Schoenbrun (1998: 114) also suggests that: 
Actual archaeological recognition of concentrations of wealth, 
currencies, or other symbols of surplus production might come with the 
excavation of Early Iron Age burials, should archaeologists be fortunate 
enough to locate any.       
Within this context then the Kabusanze burial, and site in general, are highly 
significant. Whilst it is difficult to attribute a status value to the burial in the absence 
of more comparative material, it does appear to have material and symbolic wealth 
associated with it due to its interment with whole or near whole Urewe vessels, 
whole iron objects and other adornments, including a long-distance exchange 
artefact. This can be compared again to the grave from Tongo (Misago and 
Shumbusho 1992) where the adult skeleton was found with iron rings and whole 
Urewe vessels. Thus, based on this anecdotal evidence it is suggested that wealth did 
exist during this period, which may be related the concepts discussed above by 
Schoenbrun (1998: 114). However, the pathologies suffered by the adult male from 
the burial suggest that a food surplus was not always present and thus cannot be 
taken for granted.  
This summary discussion has taken tentative steps into the socio-political 
organisation of Urewe using peoples c.400 AD in southern and northern Rwanda. 
However, much more work is needed to create a comparative body of data through 
which these ideas can be explored further. For example, the successful test-
excavation unit at Kabusanze should be returned to, re-excavated and expanded in 
order to see if more graves associated with Urewe ceramics exist.  
These issues of ceramic variability and subsistence economic practices will now be 
explored at Karama in central Rwanda in a subsequent chronological period.  
9.14 Late Iron Age Transition and Broader Relevance 
Related Research Question: were Classic Urewe ceramics rapidly replaced by 
roulette-decorated ceramics in Rwanda, or did a transitional phase exist as seen 
elsewhere?  
The radiocarbon sample from Karama dates the fill of the large conical pit to the 7th 
to 9th century AD (Fig. 9.1), the transitional phase already identified in other areas of 
Great Lakes Africa, between the Early and Late Iron Age (e.g. Ashley 2005). The 
research was also able to directly target the Musanze caves and neighbouring 
Virunga caves to investigate Van Notens (1983) often-cited early dates for roulette-
decorated ceramics in Rwanda. New dates generated by this research suggest a more 
conservative interpretation of these dates is now appropriate. The significance of 
these dates is discussed in detail below.   
Outside of Rwanda, in Kenya and Uganda, recent research has established an 
association between the decline of Classic Urewe, into a devolved form, and an 
archaeological hiatus, or transitional period, between the Early and Late Iron Age 
(Ashley 2005; Posnansky et al. 2005; Reid and Ashley 2007). Until now, this phase 
has not been identified in Rwanda, instead the cultural change from the Urewe using 
communities of the Early Iron Age to the roulette using ones of the Late Iron Age has 
been presented as abrupt (Van Grunderbeek 1992: 61). However, the results of this 
research suggest that this transitional phase also exists in Rwandan archaeology but 
has not been identified partly because of a skewed reading of the radiocarbon dates 
for roulette-decorated pottery, alongside a more established acceptance of the 
Early/Late Iron Age dichotomy. For example, Clists (1987: 35) critical reappraisal of 
the Early Iron Age Urewe industry places the end of the Early Iron Age Urewe using 
period in the mid 7th century AD, whilst analysis of the Late Iron Age in Rwanda 
place the earliest roulette-decorated dates in the 8th and 9th centuries AD (e.g. Van 
Noten 1983: 35; Van Grundebeek 1992: 61, 69). However, such presentations are 
based on a selective interpretation of the radiocarbon results that opt for the earliest 
possible margin for two isolated roulette dates (Fig. 9.6).

Fig. 9.6 Table showing the early radiocarbon dates for roulette-decorated pottery in Rwanda 
Other, more critical, approaches to these dates (e.g. de Maret 1977) have ruled out 
the earliest date from Cyamakuza suggesting it to be erroneous, the result of 
possible contamination. Additionally, they have highlighted the high degree of error 
present in the later sample from Akameru (GrN-7671) that if calibrated to 2 sigma 
could fall anywhere between the 8th to the 12th centuries AD. This date has been 
directly investigated during this research by generating radiocarbon dates from the 
earliest deposits in two caves neighbouring Akameru, Musanze II and III, and three 
dates from the earliest deposits in comparable caves from the local vicinity, Nguri 
Cave and Mweru Cave. The results from this investigation are remarkably consistent 
and place the earliest occupation of these caves in the 11th to 12th centuries AD. The 
date from Akameru overlaps this range and it is suggested here that it would be 
unlikely for Akameru to have been occupied significantly earlier than its large 
neighbours, that contain very similar archaeological assemblages, which are situated 
not more than a 100m apart. Thus, it is suggested that the interpretation of the 
earliest roulette-decoration in Rwanda should be shifted approximately 300 years 
later than in previous presentations. If this were done there would be a similar gap 
between the end of the Early Iron Age in the mid 7th century AD and the appearance 
of roulette-decorated ceramics at the beginning of the 2nd millennium AD, as has 
been identified in neighbouring countries (Clist 1987; Van Grunderbeek 1992).  
Although a re-calculation of the dates for the material from the Virunga Caves 
suggests that there is a gap between the decline of Classic Urewe ceramics in 
Rwanda and the appearance of roulette decorated material, it is not evidence for a 
transitional period alone. For example, in the absence of other material from that 
period it may represent a period of depopulation, as suggested by Wotzka (2006), or 
simply that the archaeological record has been incompletely studied. However, the 
single date from the large conical pit in association with a potential devolved from of 
Urewe from Karama (see Chapter 7 section 7.4), dating to this intervening period, 
suggests that a similar transitional period to those identified outside of Rwanda (e.g. 
Ashley 2005; Posnansky et al. 2005) may also have occurred in parts of Rwanda. 
Other comparable non-Urewe incised ceramics have also been identified in Rwanda 
(e.g. Van Noten 1983) from deposits dating to this intervening period (Fig. 9.7). 
These ceramics will be discussed in more detail below as the argument for a 
transitional period in Rwanda is developed further.

9.15 Transitional Ceramics in Central Rwanda: Karama  
Related Research Question: What happened to Urewe at the end of the Early Iron 
There were three types of archaeological ceramic identified at Karama, including 
Classic Urewe sherds, a separate incised and impressed ceramic and roulette-
decorated ceramics. The Urewe sherds were very rare and were not found during 
excavation but were identified on the surface of the road during survey. The 
roulette-decorated sherds were recovered during excavation but were found in the 
upper levels within deposits that had been disturbed by recent cultivation. Whilst 
the presence of these two ceramic types suggests that the hilltop at Karama was 
inhabited during both the Early and the Late Iron Age they are otherwise 
unremarkable due to their lack of contextual information. However the 
incised/impressed ceramics that were recovered from both of the two pits, one of 
which has been radiocarbon dated to the 7- 9th centuries AD are believed to be 
significant. These ceramics do not fit with Classic Urewe, nor are they similar in 
fabric or decoration to roulette-decorated Late Iron Age ceramics. Furthermore, 
chronologically they fall within the archaeological hiatus discussed in Chapter 4 
(section 4.3) and thus potentially represent a transitional, post-Urewe, ceramic.  
The incised/impressed ceramics from the pits at Karama have been discussed in 
detail in Chapter 7 (section 7.4) but the salient results are summarised here:  
The fabrics from the large conical pit included G1 (35%), G2 (21%), G4 (29%) and 
miscellaneous (15%). Whilst there was more variation in the shallow pit this 
assemblage was very fragmented with 52% miscellaneous, which complicated 
confident fabric attributions. Seven reconstructable vessels were recovered from the 
conical pit, which included four hemispherical bowls, one open bowl, one flared 
mouth bowl and one beaker. Only one jar was found within the total reconstructable 
assemblage from Karama (23 vessels). There were no bevelled rims identified, 
instead the majority of the assemblage was made up of simple rounded rims. The pit 
ceramics displayed crude incising, fingernail impressions and punctates (Figs 7.13 
and 7.14).  
Although the incised/impressed ceramics from the pits are broadly comparable to 
Classic Urewe through the use of incised cross-hatching and punctates and a range 
of vessel forms, with a limited fabric range, they are clearly distinct. For example: the 
application of decoration is not to the same standard as would normally be expected 
on Classic Urewe vessels, the most difficult to execute forms, such as jars, are almost 
non-existent, and the fabric range is broader and coarser than expected with Classic 
Urewe. Furthermore, although Classic Urewe, with complex bevelling and cross-
hatching was found during surface survey, the dating of the incised/impressed 
assemblage from Karama puts it at the extreme end, or outside of, the accepted date 
range for Classic Urewe in the 7th to 9th centuries AD, but well before the dates for 
the start of the Late Iron Age in Rwanda, early 2nd millennium AD. Thus, it is 
suggested here that these ceramics are a devolved form of Urewe, particular to 
Karama, that represent a window into the terminal 1st millennium AD archaeological 
hiatus already identified outside of Rwanda (e.g. Ashley 2005). 
Work in neighbouring Uganda (Ashley 2005; Posnansky et al. 2005) has established 
the existence of devolved Urewe ceramics at sites on the shores of Lake Victoria (see 
Chapter 4 section 4.5). Whilst the ceramics identified at Karama do not match 
Posnanskys (et al. 2005) or Ashleys (2005) devolved Urewe material from Lolui 
Island, or the incised material identified during this research from Masangano, it 
does not mean that they are unrelated phenomenon. Posnansky and Ashley argued 
that their devolved Urewe was the result of a lowering of investment and a loss of 
skills by the Urewe producers during the terminal 1st millennium AD, that was 
probably related to other wider, but as yet poorly understood, socio-political 
changes happening around this time in Great Lakes Africa (Posnansky et al. 2005: 
87). However, whilst devolution may have been related to wider more general 
processes the specific results will differ at each location. Thus devolved Urewe 
cannot be narrowly defined but can be described as a reduction in technological 
investment resulting in the loss or simplification of bevelling, burnishing, dimple-
bases, complex vessel forms, such as jars, and execution of complex decorative 
motifs. It is believed that a similar process may have taken place at Karama. At some 
point the hilltop at Karama was occupied by Classic Urewe users, as suggested by 
the surface assemblage, but around the time of Urewe decline after the end of the 7th 
century AD (Clist 1987) a ceramic assemblage without jars, a less well defined fabric 
range, crude cross hatching and fingernail impressions was created at the site.  
This section will now briefly return to the evidence for the existence of devolved 
Urewe outside of Rwanda before discussing other ceramics from various Rwandan 
sites that may be better understood through a late 1st millennium AD devolved 
model. 
9.17 Devolved Urewe 
Posnansky (1961b; et al. 2005: 73-100) studied the ceramics from Lolui Island in Lake 
Victoria, Uganda, and was the first to suggest the existence of a devolved form of 
Urewe (also see Chapter 4 section 4.5). Posnansky et al. (2005: 85-88) compared two 
types of Urewe from Lolui (devolved and Classic Urewe) and highlighted the 
similarities in basic style of the two types alongside differences in technological 
investment, such as reductions in the number of complex bevelled rims, a reduction 
in complex vessel forms, features and decoration, such as jars, dimple bases and 
decorative channelling, and the appearance of poorly executed cross-hatching, and 
non-parallel incised lines (Posnansky et al. 2005: 86). Unfortunately, the devolved 
material from Lolui lacks absolute dates, so the relationship between the producers 
of devolved Urewe and Classic Urewe is not fully understood. However, Posnansky 
et al. (2005: 87) suggest that the devolved material is most likely the result of 
chronological change and temporal variation and are not contemporary 
phenomenon because the island is too small to support two separate ceramic 
traditions at one time (Posnansky et al. 2005). Similar degeneration of fabric and 
coarsening of decoration at lakeshore sites such as Sanzi and Luzira (Reid 2002; 
Ashley 2005; Reid and Ashley 2007) indicate this was being replicated at a larger 
regional scale. Radiocarbon samples from that research date this period of change to 
the late 1st millennium AD, at the same point where there is a decline in Urewe sites 
(Clist 1987). Recent work at Lutoboka on Bugala Island, Uganda, also provides a late 
1st millennium date for this material (Ashley 2005; Posnansky et al. 2005: 89). This 
definition of devolved Urewe matches well with the material from Karama, which is 
also dated to the terminal 1st millennium AD and exhibits a similar reduction in 
technological investment compared to the surface Classic Urewe remains found at 
the site. The Karama material is of particular note within this devolved context 
because previous examples of devolved Urewe have all been on the shores of Lake 
Victoria, suggesting that it is a lake bound phenomenon. However, the example 
from Karama and the potential material from Masangano suggest it is part of even 
wider cultural processes.   
9.18 Devolved Urewe in Rwanda? 
The suggested devolved Urewe ceramics from Masangano and Karama are the first 
to be identified in Rwanda, which may be because the devolved model has never 
been applied there. However, a review of the available archaeological ceramic 
literature and published illustrations suggests that devolved ceramics may have 
already been encountered on numerous occasions but have not been formerly 
identified as such, instead being termed non-Urewe incised ceramics or C-Ware 
(Hiernaux and Maquet: 1960; Nenquin 1967a; Van Noten 1983). The failure to 
identify a cultural relationship between these ceramics may be because of their 
morphological differences that would usually mask their broad technological 
similarities within a non-chain operatoire approach to ceramic analysis and 
definition. Instead by employing a Posnansky et al.s (2005) devolved model their 
differences can be better understood as a process of devolution or transition taking 
place in differently in various locations creating subtle variations in the ceramics, as 
suggested for Masangano and Karama. This section will now consider other 
Rwandan ceramics that may be related to this phenomenon briefly mentioned 
already in section 9.4.  
Two groups of Iron Age archaeological ceramics are of particular note here, C-
Ware (Hiernaux and Maquet 1957, 1960; Nenquin 1967a, 1967b) and non-Urewe 
incised wares (Van Noten 1983; Van Grunderbeek 1992) amongst other 
miscellaneous incised examples (Simon 1983). The majority of these poorly 
understood ceramics have not been absolute dated and whilst many have been 
attributed to the Early Iron Age (Van Noten 1983; Van Grunderbeek 1992) others 
have been considered to be recent (e.g. Van Noten 1983) based on the better 
understood surface material that they have been found mixed with, such as Classic 
Urewe or roulette-decorated ceramics. However, in light of the work by Ashley 
(2005) and Posnansky et al. (2005), and the absolute date generated for similar 
material identified during this research at Karama, these ceramics should now be 
reconsidered.  
Non-Urewe Early Iron Age ceramics have been identified by Van Noten (1983) and 
Van Grunderbeek (1992) at Kabuye II and XV and Mutwarubona, and have already 
mentioned in relation to the results from Masangano. The dates from these sites fall 
within the terminal 1st millennium AD and their association with earlier ceramics 
such as Urewe at all of the sites has been established. Furthermore, the description of 
these roughly incised ceramics (e.g. Figs. 4.9 and 4.10) puts them well within the 
devolved Urewe ceramic model. However, the relationship between C-Ware 
ceramics and the Early Iron Age is less well understood. This term has been used 
within Rwanda to describe a broad group of poorly understood incised ceramics 
(Nenquin 1967b), and should not be confused with Van Notens (1983) C-Type 
that he defined as Late Iron Age knotted-strip roulette-decorated ceramics. Hiernaux 
and Maquet (1960: 68) first coined the term C-Ware at Nyirankuba in Rwanda to 
describe a ceramic showing rare parallel incisions, square impressions, fine grained 
temper, pots or bowls with closed opening, and a relatively thin wall thickness 
compared to A-Ware (dimple-based or Urewe ceramics) and B-Ware (roulette-
decorated ceramics), that displayed restricted decorative styles and vessel forms. 
Nenquin (1967b: 652) also noted the presence of cross-hatching and bird bone 
impression. Hiernaux and Maquet (1960: 69) noted that the ceramic is not totally 
dissimilar to either A-Ware or B-Ware but is most similar to A-Ware. 
Hiernaux and Maquet (1960) offered no interpretation of C-Ware, nor did later 
summaries of Rwandan ceramics (e.g. Nenquin 1967a, 1967b, 1971), yet in the 
absence of any absolute dates, and despite a consistent site based relationship with 
Urewe, Nenquin (1967b: 652) suggested it was a recent ceramic. Whilst it is too early 
to lump C-Ware with devolved Urewe, because of a lack of good contextual data 
and absolute dates, the basic comparison between decorative styles, the association 
with Urewe sites, such as Nyirankuba, and the similarity with the dated material for 
Karama leads this research to tentatively suggest that some C-Ware ceramics may 
be related to the processes of Urewe devolution.   
The remaining notable sites with incised/impressed ceramics in Rwanda come from 
Bugarama and Kiguhu on the lakeshores in Northern Rwanda (Simon 1983). At 
Kiguhu a few sherds from two reconstructable incised vessels were recovered from 
the surface of a marsh (Fig. 4.12). These ceramics are notable for their incised 
herringbone decoration and the broad dimple on the base, which has also been 
noted in Posnansky et al.s (2005) devolved Urewe ceramics from Lolui. Simon 
(1983) has compared the ceramics from Kiguhu to those from Mubuga III in Burundi 
that were dated to the 3rd century AD and to the finger impressed Urewe vessels 
from Ruhimangyargya (e.g. Nenquin 1967a: 261; Van Noten 1983). A larger ceramic 
assemblage was excavated from stratigraphically well-defined deposits at Bugarama 
including a deposit with crudely incised ceramics that was found beneath a deposit 
with roulette-decorated ceramics. Simon (1983) compared the Bugarama ceramics 
with the roughly incised ceramics from Masangano, to which they have a strong 
decorative resemblance. Unfortunately, an attempt during this research to increase 
these assemblage sizes and to collect dating materials through excavation at Kiguhu 
and Bugarama was unsuccessful (described in more detail in Chapter 8 section 8.2). 
Therefore, despite broadly conforming to a devolved Urewe model and pre-dating 
roulette-decorated ceramics, in the case of Bugarama, due to a lack of absolute dates 
and an absence of Classic Urewe at these sites the interpretation of these ceramics 
and their association with a transitional Iron Age period remains intriguing but 
highly speculative.  
9.19 Summary Discussion 
In summary then, this research suggests that the ceramics from Karama and many of 
the other incised/impressed non-Urewe ceramics, including C-Ware, from 
Rwanda may be related to the devolved Urewe ceramics already identified in Great 
Lakes Africa (e.g. Posnansky 1961b; Ashley 2005; Posnansky et al. 2005). Suggesting 
that devolved Urewe can no longer be considered just a lake phenomenon but was 
part of larger region wide changes. As has already been established in Chapter 4 
section 4.3, little is known archaeologically about this terminal 1st millennium AD 
archaeological hiatus. Thus, to offer some explanation for this regional ceramic 
phenomenon these results will be compared with presentations generated by 
historical linguistics. 
Schoenbrun (1998: 123-253) in his summary of the period from c.800 to 1500 AD in 
Great Lakes Africa notes that this was period began with various processes of 
regional change and has characterised these into three geographical zones: the Kivu 
Rift Valley, in which Rwanda is included, the savannah to the east and finally the 
area immediately between the savannah and Lake Victoria. Shoenbrun (1998: 123) 
suggests that the beginning of the 9th century AD in the Kivu Rift Valley saw the 
appearance of new forms of specialised farming, such as pastoralism and banana 
cultivation agriculture that changed the social world of the regions inhabitants. 
Resulting in the creation of new social institutions to manage emerging gendered 
identities associated with the appearance of these subsistence activities and to 
negotiate new power structures between various stakeholders.  
The linguistic data suggests that this situation was mirrored on the western shores of 
Lake Victoria where new strategies were embarked upon following the end of 
period of climatic after c.500 AD and imposition of periods of alternating high and 
low rainfall (Schoenbrun 1998: 124). These new environmental stresses encouraged 
the development of risk management strategies, which again saw new the rise of 
new political structures emphasising the rights of first-comers over newcomers to 
ensure land and labour rights, where previously all comers had been welcomed 
equally. Finally, Schoenbrun (1998: 125) suggests that it was this environmental 
uncertainty and the development of new institutions drew some of the inhabitants of 
the Kivu Rift Valley and the western lakeshores into the savannah between 900 and 
1100 AD, leading to the establishment of grassland sites such as Ntusi, Munsa and 
Mubende Hill. 
Thus, the linguistic evidence suggests similar historical situations were taking place 
on either side of the savannah c.800 AD that ultimately produced similar results in 
terms of settlement shift and the development of more specialised forms of farming. 
However, it is suggested here that during the early phase of this period, broadly 
termed the terminal 1st millennium AD, due to experimentation, innovation and the 
creation of new social institutions, suggested by the historical linguistics, significant 
changes took place in the social world of this regions inhabitants along localised 
trajectories, at least initially. Furthermore, it is suggested here that the changing 
roles, perhaps associated with changes in gendered identities, resulted in less effort 
expenditure in socially embed technologies such as ceramic production. Perhaps 
compounded by the involvement of new inexperienced potters from the community 
becoming involved as the organisation of production changed.  
Whilst this remains highly speculative it may explain why devolved or transitional 
Urewe styles appear to exist both in Rwanda, away from the lakes as suggested by 
this research and also by the western edge of Lake Victoria as suggested by 
Posnansky et al. (2005). The following section will now discuss the subsistence 
evidence from Karama, which suggests that at this early stage in the transition 
mixed farming was still being practised in central Rwanda.   
9.20 Karama 600-900 AD: Mixed Subsistence   
Before this research, with the exception of three cattle molars from southern Rwanda 
(Van Noten 1983; Van Grunderbeek 1981; Van Grunderbeek et al. 2001: 273-275; Van 
Grunderbeek and Roche 2005), the earliest known domesticated cattle and small 
stock bones in Rwanda were found in early 2nd millennium AD contexts at 
Cyinkomane and Akameru (Gautier 1983: 104-120). Furthermore, although hunting 
is assumed to have existed during the Early Iron Age in Rwanda based on the 
linguistic evidence (Ehret 1998: 123-124; Schoenbrun 1998: 66-68) there was no direct 
evidence (Van Grunderbeek and Roche 2007: 305). The earliest Iron Age 
zooarchaeological hunted remains identified so far have again come from 
Cyinkomane and Akameru, dated to the early 2nd millennium AD (Gautier 1983).  
The charcoal from the large conical pit has been dated to the 7th-9th centuries AD and 
by association so have the palaeobotanical and zooarchaeological remains from that 
feature. The shallow pit did not have absolute dates generated, due to funding 
constraints, but contains the same incised/impressed, devolved Urewe, ceramic and 
thus is believed to be contemporary with the larger pit. The palaeobotanical samples 
from the pits revealed charred finger millet seeds (Eleusine coracana) (Fig. 9.8). These 
are the earliest macro remains in Rwanda and they continue to support the 
suggestion that small-scale non-intensive cultivation of domestic cereal grain existed 
in the 1st millennium AD in Rwanda.

 4 Shallow pit fill Finger millet Middle Iron Age 
Fig. 9.8 Table showing the palaeobotanical results for Kabusanze 
Zooarchaeological remains were identified at Karama in both of the pits. 
Unfortunately, the single large bovid vertebrae from the shallow pit could not be 
identified to species. However, in the large conical pit fill there was a range of 
specimens identified to species, including: specimens from domesticated Bos taurus, 
with one showing butchery knife marks, alongside individual specimens from giant 
forest hog (Hylochoerus meinertzhageni), leopard (Panthera pardus) and antelope 
(Antilopinae). This assemblage is too small to be used to make assumptions about the 
scale of either hunting or herding. However, it does demonstrate that during the 
terminal 1st millennium AD the occupants of Karama had contact with both wild and 
domesticated resources. Whilst the giant forest hog and antelope may have been 
hunted for food the existence of the leopard tailbone is less easy to explain. Leopard, 
being a carnivore, is normally not presumed to be part of the diet because it has a 
low meat yield and would be dangerous and difficult to hunt, and potentially 
unpleasant to eat, being tough carnivore meat. Thus, it is more likely that it was 
brought to the site for its skin.  
Although limited in size, this subsistence assemblage from Karama supports the 
suggestion, put forward by linguists (e.g. Schoenbrun 1998) and indirect evidence, 
that populations in the 1st millennium AD were practicing, or exploiting a mixture of 
subsistence strategies. This same issue will now be explored in more detail for a very 
different and more extensive set of material from the Late Iron Age Virunga Caves in 
Northern Rwanda. 
9.21 Cave Dwelling: 2nd Millenium AD Alternative Histories 
Unfortunately during the course of this research no undisturbed, well-stratified 
archaeological sites were encountered with a ceramic sequence including both Early 
and Late, or indeed transitional, Iron Age ceramics. This situation prevents the 
research from exploring the potential for continuities in the ceramic record between 
these periods, such as in manufacturing techniques and vessel form, alongside the 
more obvious discontinuities, such as the appearance of rouletting. Whilst tempting, 
it is inappropriate to link deposits from potentially unrelated sites. However, due to 
the deep and well-stratified deposits excavated in the Virunga Caves, believed to 
date from the beginning of the 2nd millennium AD to the 19th century, it has been 
possible to explore ceramic continuity and variation within the Late Iron Age. The 
results of this analysis have shown that within these cave contexts there is a high 
level of ceramic continuity between caves and between deposits but that late in the 
2nd millennium a new, high quality, potentially imported, ceramic appears.   
The archaeological assemblages excavated from all of the caves bear a high degree of 
similarity and broadly conform to the results of Van Notens (1983: 34-35) 
excavations in Akameru and Cyinkomane, two of the other Musanze Caves. Surface 
collections of ceramics from other caves of the same geological group as the 
Virungas across the border in Uganda reveal similar, but limited results (Grace 1990: 
8790). Thus, due to the high degree of material culture compatibility between the 
caves combined with the consistent radiocarbon dates and stratigraphy the results 
from these caves will be considered together here.  
9.22 Roulette-Decorated Ceramics in the Virunga Caves 
Related Research Question: Can meaningful variation be identified within 
roulette-decorated ceramics? 
The ceramics identified within the Virunga Caves consisted entirely of roulette-
decorated Late Iron Age examples. The earliest deposits for these caves were dated 
from the 11th to 12th century AD (cal 2 sigma) and although later deposits were not 
dated it is believed, based on historical reports (e.g. Nenquin 1967a: 274; Grace 1990; 
Vansina 2004), and the small finds encountered during this research (see Chapter 8), 
that the caves continued to be occupied until the late 19th century AD. Furthermore, 
informal interviews with locals taken during the course of this research suggest that 
the caves were not occupied as living spaces during the 20th or 21st centuries, 
although they were occasionally used as boltholes during 20th century conflicts. Thus 
the ceramics from the Virunga Caves present an interesting opportunity to study the 
roulette-decorated ceramics of northern Rwanda from the 2nd millennium AD and to 
see if through multi-variant analysis socially meaningful ceramic patterns can be 
identified within the Late Iron Age roulette-decorated muddle.  
The ceramics from the Virunga Caves have been described in detail in Chapter 8 but 
the salient features of this analysis will be summarised again here. The cave ceramics 
included a wide range of fabrics. However, in all but one case, Mweru Cave, a single 
fabric dominated the assemblages. There was little stratigraphic distinction between 
the fabrics in the cave deposits with only a fine black burnished ware confined to 
particular, upper, more recent deposits. The morphological profile was dominated 
by large jars with twisted-string roulette decoration, whilst rare knotted-strip 
roulette-decorated ceramics occurred in the most recent deposits. A range of rims 
existed in all of the caves including, rounded, tapered, squared, folded and 
thickened, and handles were present in all of the caves but found in low quantities 
throughout the deposits.   
Although a comprehensive, chine opratoire multi-variant approach was applied to 
the ceramics from the Virunga Caves it revealed few consistent patterns. For 
example, there was no particular preference for roulette-decoration or placement of 
rouletting (in terms of interior and exterior rouletting), and the vessel fabric and 
form range was broad. However, there were correlations between form and fabric, 
for example at Nguri cave, fabric 3R2, 3R5, 3R7 and 3R8 were used to make jars 
whilst the remaining fabrics were confined to bowls. Similar, although less 
pronounced distributions were seen in the other caves too. These results suggest that 
a similar and related, but unspecialised, ceramic tradition existed between the caves 
and that ceramics were produced by small scale domestic production utilising local 
clay sources. An exception to this is a potential ceramic import that may be related to 
the Kingdom Era in the late 2nd millennium AD. However, it should be noted that 
the Virunga caves are only one isolated element of the roulette-decorated ceramic 
phenomenon. Thus, it may be possible for future studies to tease out patterns from 
other regions, or indeed to compare the Virunga assemblages to other definable 
groups of sites and identify significant differences.  
9.23 A Ceramic Import?  
The most significant ceramic pattern identified within the Virunga Cave ceramics 
was the occurrence of the fine black-burnished ware in the upper deposits of four of 
the Virunga Caves. This ceramic is distinct from the remaining assemblage in its 
fabric, decoration, wall thickness, colour, inclusions and overall execution. The 
ceramic is also functionally distinct being restricted to bowls, usually hemispherical 
or closed bowls. However, rare examples of beakers and tapered bowls also exist at 
Musanze IV. This ceramic is also quite rare, it only accounts for 1% or less of each 
ceramic assemblage. Unfortunately none of the deposits where this sherd was 
identified were radiocarbon dated so it has not been possible to establish an absolute 
date. 
In order to arrive at a more precise date comparative material has been sought from 
other Late Iron Age sites in the region, which has produced mixed and inconclusive 
results. For example, illustrated within Van Notens (1983) excavated assemblage 
from the grave of Kigeri Rwabugiri, who died in 1895, there are two vessels with 
very comparable decoration (e.g. Fig. 9.9). However, their forms, closed vases, are 
very different. More significantly, a comparable fine-ware ceramic was excavated 
from a Late Iron Age site, radiocarbon dated to 17th - 19th century, on the Rusizi Plain 
in Burundi (Meulemeester and Waleffe 1973: 16-23). This ceramic from the second 
most recent deposit was thin walled between 4-8mm and has very fine twisted-
string roulette-decoration running in a variety of directions (Meulemeester and 
Waleffe 1973: 20). Unfortunately no rims, or reconstructable vessels were identified 
at the Rusizi site so they cannot be compared here. Examples were also sought from 
Ryamurari, the 17th century capital of the Ndorwa Kingdom, situated within the 
borders of modern Rwanda, but no similar material was found although high 
quality ceramics of a similar standard do exist (Tshihiluka 1983).  
Fig. 9.9 Illustration showing fine twisted-string roulette-decorated vessel from Kigeri Rwabugiris 
grave, Rwanda (reproduced from Van Noten 1983: Plate 58) 
However, Desmedt (1991: 185-192) has identified a very similar ceramic from Dahwe 
in southern Rwanda that she has termed Group Y (see Chapter 4, section 4.6 of 
this thesis for earlier discussion). This luxury ceramic has very thin walls, fine 
twisted string horizontal rouletting, commonly on black burnished ware, with 
slightly everted rims on hemispherical bowls (Desmedt 1991: 172) (e.g. Figs 9.9 and 
9.10) and thus are virtually identical to those discussed here from the Virunga Caves 
(Fig. 8.97). Desmedt (1991: 187-188) suggests that this ceramic is present at a range of 
sites in western Uganda including Kibiro, Bigo and Bweyore, amongst others. 
However, from her discussion it is not clear if she is referring to her Group-X, 
knotted-strip roulette decorated ceramics or actual Group-Y because she does not 
always distinguish between the two. Furthermore, reviews of the excavation reports 
from these sites (e.g. Connah 1996, 1997; Reid 2002) and discussions with more 
recent excavators of some of these sites (e.g. Andrew Reid pers comm. 2009) have 
failed to positively identify similar ceramics as those she describes from Dahwe. 
Indeed it appears that Desmedt (1991: 187) based many of her identifications of Y-
Group on pipe stems and whilst these may be related it is not believed this 
relationship has been sufficiently established as to prove the unity of these two 
forms conclusively.  
Fig. 9.9 Photograph showing Group-Y ceramic, Dahwe, Rwanda (Desmedt 1991: 166, Fig. 6) 
Fig. 9.10 Photograph showing Group-Y ceramic, Dahwe, Rwanda (Desmedt 1991: 166, Fig. 7) 
Thus, in the absence of more comparative illustrations black burnished fine ware, or 
Group-Y has only been positively identified at the Rusizi Plain in Burundi, Dahwe 
in Southern Rwanda and the Musanze Caves. Vansina (2004: 21) has discussed the 
appearance of this luxury ceramic and believes it directly attests to the emergence 
of a true elite during the seventeenth century. Based on Desmedts (1991) 
suggestion that this ceramic arrived in Rwanda from the north and came from 
western Uganda Vansina (2004: 21) tentatively suggests that the appearance of these 
luxury vessels reflects the creation of a kingdom in central Rwanda in the 17th 
century by a group coming from the north that did not alter the bulk of the 
population. However, in the absence of more dated sites, Vansina suggests that this 
proposal cannot properly be evaluated. More over he suggests (Vansina 2004: 21) 
that it is, just as probable that even the luxury ceramic Y spread by imitation from 
center to center without any migration, not even by new political leaders. Thus, 
even without questioning Desmedts (1991) sites in western Uganda, Vanisna 
questions Desmedts migration conclusions. Therefore, since this thesis questions the 
confidence of Desmedts typology and definition of Group-Y this explanation 
cannot be entertained further here. However, the appearance of this luxury ceramic 
at a time when the kingdom of Rwanda is believed to have emerged in central 
Rwanda is a strong co-incidence and suggests wealth was becoming more 
concentrated and was being expressed within through ceramic production and use.  
A luxury ceramic, associated with the appearance of the kingdom and wealth, but 
only found in very small quantities in the caves suggests that these were not made 
by the cave occupants, as the cruder more frequent wares may have been, but 
instead represent a trade, or imported ceramic. If this was the case then it suggests 
trade items were travelling in the opposite direction too. Unfortunately, whilst this is 
not unlikely, in the absence of comparably dated non-cave farming sites nearby, we 
cannot explore this. However, the cave assemblages provide further evidence of 
interaction and possibly trade within the zooarchaeological assemblage, discussed 
below. 
9.24 Virunga Caves 1100 to Recent: forager-farmer relations 
The zooarchaeological remains recovered from the Virunga Caves during this 
research were broadly similar to those excavated by Van Noten (1983), and analysed 
by Gautier (1983: 104-120), from Cyinkomane and Akameru, two of the Musanze 
caves also within the Virunga group. Both contained similar domestic species and a 
wide range of wild specimens consistent with a forest environment (Fig. 9.11). Van 
Noten (1983) did not attempt palaeobotanical sampling during his excavations but 
indirect evidence of grain use was identified in the form of grinding stones. This was 
supported by the identification of more grinding stones and pounding stones during 
this research and by direct evidence in the form of charred and calcified 
domesticated cereal grains (Fig 9.12).

Despite the similarities between these two bodies of work the larger more extensive 
zooarchaeological assemblages from this research contradict Gautiers (1983) 
interpretation of the cave material from Van Notens (1983) excavations. The results 
presented here suggest that the cave occupants were not herders who used the caves 
for refuge in times of need, hunting opportunistically, as suggested by Gautier 
(1983). Instead they were foragers who had sustained contact and interaction with 
farmers across a food producing static frontier (Lane 2004) in order to increase the 
food procurement strategies and reduce risks associated with a forager lifestyle. This 
relationship endured until late in the 19th century when a moving frontier made 
their earlier life way untenable.  
This section will first discuss Gautiers (1983) interpretation in the light of the new 
results from this research, before contextualising the results from the Virunga Caves 
within the extant forager-farmer relationship models (e.g. Alexander 1984a,b; Lane 
2004; Kusimba 2003). Following on from this, the section will then contrast and 
compare these results with a selection of brief examples of other forager-farmer 
contexts in the central African rainforest (Mercader 2000), Great Lakes Africa (Lane 
et al. 2007), east Africa (Lane 2004) and southern Africa (Barham and Mitchell 2008).  
9.24 Foragers not Herders: Virunga Cave Dwellers  
From the full range of species identified within Van Notens (1983) excavated 
assemblage, Gautier (1983) proposed a subsistence suite of species that could have 
contributed to the diet of the cave occupants, and isolated them from the total. The 
domestic species within the subsistence suite included cattle (Bos taurus), chicken 
(Gallus gallus), sheep/goat (Ovis/Capra) and the wild remains included sitatunga 
(Tragelaphus spekei), Duiker (Cephalophus), giant pouched rat (Cricetomys) and 
elephant (Loxidonta africana). After combining the results of the assemblages from 
both caves Gautier (1983: 117) found that cattle represented 33.7% of the remains. 
Based on these results Gautier suggested that the occupants of the caves were 
involved primarily with cattle herding when away from the caves, and only 
retreated to the caves at times when the herders were threatened by conflict. Gautier 
suggested that the wild species were only exploited out of convenience whilst the 
herders were in the forest. However, in light of the results of the zooarchaeological 
analysis conducted by this research, at three of the neighbouring Musanze caves and 
two volcanic caves in the outlying region, this model of cave occupation is no longer 
tenable.  
Firstly, the authority of Gautiers (1983) domestic to wild ratio is questioned. 
Gautiers combined assemblage gave a ratio of 1:1, (49.6% domestic). However, this 
was not the case with the results of this research where the domestic to wild ratio 
stayed remarkably stable at approximately 1:5 throughout the majority of contexts 
excavated. The discrepancy between Gautiers results and those presented here may 
be the result of a number of causes. For example Gautiers subsistence suite is less 
inclusive than the one used by this research. For example Gautier does not include 
suids in his suite despite identifying Great Forest Hog remains in the Cyinkomane 
assemblage and nor are hyrax remains included, which have been identified in 
various contexts at Akameru (Gautier 1983: 104-109). The result of Gautiers reduced 
suite is an increase in the ratio of domestic specimens to wild ones compared to the 
more extensive list employed. The different sample sizes between Gautiers 
assemblage and this research may also be significant. Gautiers assemblage size is 
much smaller than the one analysed. For example, Gautiers (1983: 116) combined 
assemblage from Cyinkomane and Akameru included 722 specimens of which he 
identified 203 (28.12%). Due to the larger test excavation unit size, more caves 
excavated, and by utilising more broad taxonomic categories, such as the bovid size 
class range, this research analysed 2277 specimens and identified 1494 (65.61%).  
Thus, due to a larger sample size, from a greater range of sites, with a more inclusive 
and appropriate subsistence suite, the wild to domestic percentage results of this 
research should be considered to be more reliable than those from Gautiers analysis. 
These results suggest domestic species were less important to the cave occupants. 
Thus a fundamental component of Gautiers (1983) model has been reversed.  
The results of this research suggest that 83% of the subsistence suite enjoyed by the 
cave occupants were from wild species, presumed to be the result of hunting, with 
the remainder made of sheep/goat, cattle, and rare chicken. Whilst this distribution 
shift from domestic to wild specimens does not preclude Gautiers model entirely, 
for example the cave occupants may still have been herders taking refuge but with a 
greater reliance on wild species than previously believed, a consideration of the 
specimens within the wild assemblage does. For example, the species included 
within the combined assemblage include a range of dangerous and difficult to hunt 
species, such as buffalo, elephant, lion and hippo that Marshall and Stewart (1994: 
14-15) suggest only experienced hunters would have the skills to procure. Thus, 
Gautiers suggestion that these were opportunistic hunters, whilst not totally 
disproved, has seriously been brought this into doubt.  
Furthermore, Gautiers (1983: 118) suggestion, that when not in the caves the 
communities responsible for the deposition of the faunal assemblage were primarily 
involved with cattle herding, is also problematic. For example, if this were the case 
then we might expect to see a relatively stable kill off exploitation pattern that 
reflects their herding knowledge (OConnor 2000: 155-156). However, this is not the 
case. The cattle remains demonstrate that wide age ranges of animals were 
butchered, from the extremely young to the extremely old, with many examples in 
between. This does not conform to a specialised pastoral pattern and suggests that 
there wasnt a high degree of familiarity with herding. Furthermore, the butchery 
marks also support this suggestion, because they do not conform to a pattern one 
would expect if there were a ready supply of meat available from a herd. Instead the 
butchery marks suggest that domestic animals were extremely heavily butchered 
with effort made to extract all possible nutrition from the bones. For example, 
mandibles and other cranial elements commonly show heavy knife marks, and 
phalanges and scapula examples have been punctured to access marrow, at 
particularly low yield areas of the skeleton. Suggesting that the availability of 
domestic meat was limited so when it was fully exploited. 
The results of this research suggest that the cave occupants were primarily hunters, 
with specialised knowledge, who supported their subsistence through interactions 
with farmers via raiding or trade to receive domesticated resources. Based on the 
occurrence of a luxury ceramic, associated with rising wealth and the kingdom (see 
discussion section 9.23 this chapter) and domesticated cereal grains in the caves, 
trade seems the more likely method of procurement because these products are 
unlikely to have been raided. The following section will now discuss these results 
and this interpretation within wider forager-farmer debates, first by applying 
various forager-farmer models and finally by comparing the results with other 
regional examples.    
9.25 Forager-Farmer Models  
The issue of forager-farmer relations has been tackled by archaeologists working in 
Great Lakes Africa, the east African rift valley (Lane 2004; et al. 2007) and in 
southern Africa (Barham and Mitchell 2008), amongst many others. For example, 
through the application of Alexanders (1977, 1978, 1984a, 1984b) frontier theory to 
the adoption of food production in Kenya, Lane (2004: 245) has explored 
archaeological correlates with phases in the adoption of farmer/herder life ways by 
hunters/gatherers/fishers, including a pioneer phase, a substitution phase and a 
consolidation phase. These phases occur as part of a moving frontier that is 
initiated or restarted when a territorially expanding, food-producing society reaches, 
and crosses, the limits, or static frontiers imposed by earlier climatic, geographic, or 
resistance boundaries (Barham and Mitchell 2008: 403, following Alexander 1984a). 
A static frontier may be re-established when farming groups stop expanding into 
new territories but border areas with hunter/gatherer/fisher communities, which 
may result in the establishment of mutually beneficial relations. 
During the pioneer phase, limited numbers of farmer/herder individuals explore 
new territories creating small-scale interaction with hunter/gatherer/fishers. 
Leaving traces of farmer/herder material culture or subsistence practices at 
hunter/gatherer/fisher sites. During the subsequent substitution phase 
farmer/herders begin to colonise the land and increase their interaction with 
hunter/gatherer/fishers, which may result in major changes in material culture 
inventories. Finally, during consolidation farmer/herder practices intensify with 
potentially destructive consequences for the hunter/gatherer/fisher communities 
(Alexander 1977, 1978, 1984a, 1984b, Lane 2004; Barham and Mitchell 2008).  
The following sections will briefly discuss three geographically contrasting examples 
where forager-farmer relations have been explored in the region and in southern 
Africa before returning to the Virunga cave dwellers and how these models and 
examples influence our interpretation of them.  
9.26 Forager-Farmer Relations: The Forest 
Until recently the Virunga caves would have been enclosed within the central 
African rainforest, the borders of which today are only a short distance to the north. 
However, they remained close to the edge of the forest throughout the 2nd 
millennium AD (Vansina 2004). Therefore, an interesting comparison can be made 
between the results of this study and the findings of Mercader et al. (2000) regarding 
forager-farmer relations in the nearby Ituri rainforest, DRC. Although Mercader et 
al. (2000) did not find any domestic faunal remains within the archaeology of the 
Ituri forest rock shelters, such as Matupi (see Van Neer 1989), they did encounter 
ceramics and metals that they believe derived from trade between foragers and 
farmers during the Iron Age (Mercader et al. 2000: 119).  This can be contrasted with 
the Virunga Cave material where ceramics and metals also occur but alongside the 
remains of domestic species. This difference may be due to cultural exposure. For 
example, the Virunga cave occupants had already adopted ceramic technologies and 
stopped using lithics, suggested by the total lack of lithics encountered either by 
these excavations of Van Notens (1983), before they began using the caves and 
during the 2nd millennium AD lived close to herder/farmer communities at the edge 
of the forest. This situation may have facilitated the adoption of domestic animals in 
a way that was not possible for the more technologically and geographically isolated 
occupants of the Ituri rock shelters.   
9.27 Forager-Farmer Relations: Great Lakes Africa and East Africa 
Within Great Lakes Africa on the eastern shores of Lake Victoria another subtly 
different relationship occurred between foragers and farmers in the Iron Age at 
Usenge 3 (Lane et al. 2007: 62-81). In an Early Iron Age context, Lane et al. (2007: 13) 
found rare zooarchaeological evidence for domesticated species within a far richer 
wild faunal assemblage. Based on the range of species and the large amount of wild 
fauna, such as buffalo, Lane et al. (2007: 75) suggest that the faunal assemblage was 
created by, specialist and accomplished hunters rather than opportunistic kills 
made by individuals primarily engaged in a domestic economy. They also 
considered the ceramic evidence where only eight out of the possible 262 
reconstructable vessels were Classic Urewe whilst the remainder, although related 
and contemporary, were much cruder and clearly distinct (Lane et al. 2007: 15). They 
concluded that the producers behind the Usenge ceramics did not have a long term 
familiarity with Urewe ceramics but were attempting to mimic them, having been 
exposed to Urewe through contact with neighbouring farming groups as they slowly 
adopted the trappings of a farming life style (Lane et al 2007: 16). This can be 
compared to Kusimbas (2003) forager-farmer parallelism. This is just one out of a 
range of examples in Kenya that Lane (2004) considered from the Late Stone Age 
and the Iron Age within the moving frontier model. For example, a static frontier 
has been identified at Elmentietan and Savannah Pastoral Neolithic sites on the 
Laikipia Plateau that may have existed up to the 20th century, where mixed wild and 
domestic fauna have been found within the same assemblages (Siiriianen 1984). 
Clearly, the occurrence of mixed and wild fauna together is not unique, however, the 
particularities of each situation are subtly different.  
9.28 Forager-Farmer Relations: Southern Africa  
Forager-farmer relations have long been explored in southern Africa (see the 
discussion of the Kalahari debate in Chapter 4, section 4.10). For example, the trade 
and transfer of goods between forager and farmer sites has been archaeologically 
attested in the Iron Age in Southern Africa in the Thukela Basin through the 
identification of agro-pastoral ceramics at forager sites and ostrich egg shell beads, 
bone arrow points and stone tools found on farmer settlements (Barham and 
Mitchell 2008: 428). Other examples include the Kalahari, where some Bushman 
communities have acquired goats without radically altering their forager subsistence 
economy (Barham and Mitchell 2008: 422; Ikeya 1993; Kent 1993), and similar 
foragers can be seen in the 1st millennium AD archaeology of the Cape (Sadr 2003). 
Although, the adoption of livestock may be part of a process of acculturation to a 
pastoral life way (Sadr et al. 2003), this was not the case for the Virunga cave 
occupants, who remained primarily hunters throughout the 2nd millennium AD. 
Whilst there are many examples of foragers acquiring stock to minimise subsistence 
risks, to acquire additional sources of food and to accumulate wealth, the concept of 
foragers with a self-sustainable herd is more problematic (Barham and Mitchell 2008: 
424). For example Smith (2005) suggests that a sustainable herd of sheep requires at 
least 60 individuals, a size that may not be manageable by anyone other than 
someone living a full time pastoral life. Thus, this further supports the suggestion 
that the Virunga cave occupants relied upon outside support to re-supply any 
livestock that they kept.  
9.29 Forager-Farmer Relations: Virunga Caves  
The application of frontier theory to the Virunga cave subsistence results presents 
a useful opportunity through which these assemblages may be understood. Lanes 
(2004: 245) summary of archaeological signatures associated with different phases of 
the moving frontier suggests that during the pioneer phase only traces of exotic 
materials such as domestic fauna and plants may exist. This is clearly not the case at 
the Virunga caves where from the earliest contexts domestic fauna make up 
approximately 20% of all assemblages. However, Lanes (2004) substitution phase 
has more parallels with the Virunga results.  
The substitution phase is archaeologically recognisable through the identification of 
exotic goods, new technologies, products and prestige goods and the identification 
of specialised hunting, craft production and changes in dietary practice (Lane 2004: 
245). Although not matching these signatures perfectly, the Virunga caves do have a 
high percentage of domestic faunal remains alongside the presence of ceramics, iron 
and exotic black burnished ware. However, at the Virunga caves this stage 
appears to have remained stable for nearly 1000 years, which suggests their frontier 
was not moving. Instead it is suggested here that the adoption of technologies and 
products associated with farming happened before the occupation of the Virunga 
Caves began. Perhaps farmers had already interacted with the forest foragers during 
an earlier pioneer phase exposing them to new technologies and goods. However, 
further colonisation of the forests did not occur because a geographic, static 
frontier was created as the encroachment of farmers was slowed by the steep slopes 
of the volcanoes and the equatorial rainforest that covered them. It may also be 
speculated that it was the early success of the forager-farmer relations that 
encouraged the foragers to take up occupancy of the Virunga caves, so close to the 
edge of the forest, to exploit the new neighbouring markets.  
Finally, late in the 2nd millennium AD there was an abrupt halt in the occupation of 
the Virunga caves evidenced by a reduction in find density before a complete 
absence of material in the very uppermost contexts in the Virunga caves. It is 
believed that these upper deposits may relate to a consolidation phase (Lane 2004: 
245), where deforestation and growing agricultural intensification in the 19th century 
forced the cave occupants to either retreat into the forests, to become assimilated 
within different groups, such as the growing Rwandan, Nyiginya Kingdom, or 
migrate elsewhere. This destructive phase may be attested archaeologically by the 
identification of approximately 150 human skulls on the floor of one of the Musanze 
caves by Nenquin (1967a: 276). Whilst Nenquin suggests that this site may have been 
used as a refuge and later a burial ground during the 1914-1918 war, he describes 
only circumstantial evidence. There are also reports that caves from the same 
geological group nearby in neighbouring Uganda were used by hunters as a refuge 
from agricultural aggressors beginning in the 1870s after population increases in the 
neighbouring cultivator communities created internal conflict and warfare (Grace 
1990: 90). Vansina (2004) has traced the growing boundaries of the Rwanda 
Kingdom in the late 2nd millennium AD and suggests that in 1796 the Virunga caves 
fell outside of the realm but were not included under neighbouring polities. 
However, under growing expansionism, by the start of Kigeri Rwabugiris reign the 
area was brought under the control of the Rwandan kingdom, although soon after in 
1897 it was involved in anti-Tutsi revolts (Vansina 2004: 124, 153, 178-179). Thus 
the archaeological and historical evidence may support an aggressive end to the 
occupation of the Virunga caves, perhaps as the kingdom expanded, or as it 
retracted after the rule of Kigeri Rwabugiri and the ensuing wars. Although, it is 
equally plausible that as deforestation encroached on the area, the caves no longer 
afforded the occupants sufficient protection, or proximity to the wild species they 
relied upon, contributing to their abandonment.  
By contextualising the cave results within frontier theory models, Virunga 
subsistence presents an interesting study in forager-farmer relations. For nearly 1000 
years the occupants of the caves, who were practising primarily hunting and 
gathering had a sustained degree of contact with herder/farmer groups across a 
static frontier (Alexander 1984b) based on exchange and not raiding. However, 
around the same time that the fine black-burnished, potential trade ceramic was 
introduced to these sites, reflecting an increase in contact with the rising Rwanda 
Kingdom, the occupants of the caves suffered a dramatic decline in fortunes, being 
permanently removed from the area as it was overtaken by warfare and agriculture, 
and the moving frontier of food production alongside state expansion.   
This frontier model can be compared to Kusimbas (2003) tripartite forager-farmer 
relationship model, which defined relationship structures as essentially symbiotic, 
parallel or peripatetic. The first, symbiosis, suggests mutual dependency and a tied 
relationship that neither farmer nor forager can easily leave. The second, parallelism, 
involves cultural mimicry but where both groups retain a distinct identity and the 
third, peripatetic lifestyles, where hunter-gatherers may be defined as flexible 
generalists (Barham and Mitchell 2008: 406-407). In the absence of farmer sites that 
may have played a role in Virunga forager subsistence it is difficult to assign the 
Virunga cave occupants to any of the three categories above. However, it is 
suggested here that the Virunga foragers best fit a peripatetic lifestyle where they 
maintained regular contact with the farmer societies but retained their own identities 
and subsistence strategies, whilst minimising risk through the exploitation of 
neighbouring farmer resources.  
Thus through the application of forager-farmer relationship models it is possible to 
tentatively suggest a structured and dynamic relationship that may have existed 
between the Late Iron Age Virunga Cave occupants and their farmer/herder 
neighbours. This work can contribute to the growing body of archaeological data 
that exists in this field that suggests a more nuanced understanding of forager-
farmer relations is needed that can successfully incorporate the variety of subtly 
different, historically situated, and dynamic pasts that the evidence suggests existed.  
9.30 Conclusion 
This chapter has addressed the pertinent themes outlined in Chapter 3 that 
highlighted the need for perspectives that follow localised scales of research, 
including frontiers alongside centres, and which generate multi-narrative, non-
ethno-racial pasts through the use of holistic strategies based on empirical, socially 
meaningful data. This has been achieved by contextualising the research results 
described in Chapters 6, 7 and 8, within extant Iron Age archaeological debates in 
Rwanda, Great Lakes Africa and the wider region. Within this contextualisation the 
chapter has directly tackled the research questions set out in Chapter 4. 
Two important themes that were most successfully dealt with by this chapter will be 
highlighted again here: frontier studies, and continuity and variation:  
By focusing on the comparison of frontier regions with more historically central 
areas this research has identified a rich past in the Virunga Caves that spans the 2nd 
millennium AD and that is tied into the history of the Rwanda Kingdom but is not 
represented by the official or unofficial oral histories of the state (e.g. Kagame 1972; 
Vansina 2004; Chrtien 2003). The frontier research has also continued to 
demonstrate that foragers were not a shapeless mass of peoples, hapless in the face 
of the environment (Schoenbrun 1998: 66) but played a active role in the 
exploitation of the resources that surrounded them, including trade with farmers. 
Thus, the northern Rwanda frontier has a dynamic past that should be understood 
as a historical context and an important factor of pre-Colonial Rwandan life, as has 
already been demonstrated by western Rwandan frontier social histories (Newbury 
2009). 
During this research cultural continuity alongside variation has been explored 
through a number of subjects including ceramics and subsistence. The research has 
added support to the suggestion that Urewe, whilst existing as a region wide 
ceramic phenomenon also displays meaningful variation at local scales (Ashley 
2005). Furthermore, ceramic devolution appears to have occurred at approximately 
the same time across a variety of Great Lakes Africa locations at the end of the 1st 
millennium AD, potentially reflecting region wide socio-political changes. However, 
it devolved in a manner that was locally specific, that may reflect local socio-political 
variation (although much more work is needed on this). Later in the 2nd millennium 
AD, although the roulette-decorated ceramics of the Virunga Cave, like their 
subsistence practices, remained on the whole very stable, historically meaningful 
variations have been identified within the archaeology.  
By focusing on these themes, research can more effectively continue to break down 
the boundaries that have oversimplified the pre-colonial archaeology in the region 
and demonstrate that the Iron Age past was not a homogenous experience, nor can it 
simply be understood through simplistic ethno-economic assumptions that 
characterise groups based on presumed relations. This process can only aid our 
understanding of the past as we attempt to present a more accurate picture of 
complexity suggested by the evidence.  
Chapter 10 
Conclusions and Future Directions 
This thesis has documented a significant new empirical contribution to Rwandan 
archaeology through the creation, exploration and interpretation of an extensive 
new body of Iron Age archaeological materials. However, the success of this 
research lies, not so much in the documentation of new data, but rather in the 
development and implementation of a politically aware theoretical framework that 
allowed the research to take place within post-genocide Rwanda and to explore 
pasts, which are potentially non-ethno-racial in their foundation. Furthermore, the 
implementation of this framework allowed the reconstruction of a series of non-
ethno-racial pre-colonial/Iron Age pasts based on archaeological materials 
generated by new archaeological research and the reconsideration of extant sources. 
The introductory chapter to this thesis (Chapter 1) and the contemporary context 
chapter (Chapter 2) argued in favour of archaeological re-investigation, re-
construction and re-presentation of the Rwandan pre-colonial past. It was suggested 
that politically aware archaeological research could engage with pre-colonial 
Rwanda and explore pasts not defined by ethno-racial assumptions whilst 
remaining archaeologically accountable, thus contributing towards reconciliation 
and education in post-genocide Rwanda  
In Chapters 2 and 3 this thesis described how ethno-racial approaches to society by 
colonial and post-colonial administrations and culture historians racialised pre-
colonial Rwanda. Furthermore, it explained how these presentations legitimated the 
racialised construction of contemporary Rwandan society, which led to the 1994 
genocide. Chapter 2 also described how these presentations remain an obstacle to 
reconciliation in contemporary Rwanda, specifically in the field of education. 
Following the identification of this issue, Chapter 3 explored the concept of ethnicity 
and its application to the archaeology of pre-colonial Rwanda, finding it to be 
politically dangerous, historically inaccurate, archaeologically impractical, and an 
obstacle to discussions of the past.  
In response, Chapter 3 successfully developed a politically aware non-ethno-racial 
theoretical framework. This was achieved by rejecting the normative view of 
archaeological ethnic identity characteristic of a narrow culture historical approach, 
which suggests social groups were largely static and passive. This was essential 
because this framework has previously created homogenised historical 
constructions of pre-colonial Rwanda defined by social exclusivity and opposition. 
This clearly conflicts with attempts to promote reconciliation by preventing public 
discussion of the past. Instead this research embraced themes drawn from the post-
processual school of archaeology, such as multi-vocality, frontier studies and an 
emphasis on cultural variation alongside continuity, that present identity as 
dynamic and actively negotiated, therefore promoting the construction of a socially 
diverse past beneficial to the reincorporation of historical debate into society and 
fostering of reconciliation.  
Thus, Chapter 4 critically surveyed the extant body of data regarding the Iron Age 
in Rwanda and Great Lakes Africa and identified a series of archaeologically and 
socially pertinent research questions that conformed to the theoretical framework 
and which could be investigated within the limitations of a PhD. Finally, in order to 
successfully navigate from theory to practice Chapter 5 developed a holistic, 
practical and flexible fieldwork and analytical methodology capable of addressing 
the identified issues. Chapter 5 harnessed the empirical potential of traditional 
culture-historical fieldwork methods alongside a multi-variant approach to analysis. 
This successfully produced an extensive range of archaeological materials and an 
array of quantifiable variables. The interpretation of these demonstrated the 
presence of a variety of socially meaningful continuities and discontinuities in pre-
colonial Rwandan archaeology.    
This research demonstrates that politically aware theoretical frameworks and 
research methods can be applied in post-identity-based conflict situations. In 
Rwanda this means that non-ethno-racial pasts can be explored, encouraging 
historical constructions to move beyond genocidal images of the past that are 
defined by violence and tripartite social division. Instead this thesis celebrates a 
range of pasts that demonstrate the variety and complexity of human experience in 
pre-colonial Rwanda. 
10.1 Archaeological Consequences 
The research results presented in Chapters 6, 7 and 8, and contextualised in Chapter 
9, have made a significant archaeological contribution to the understanding of 
Rwandas pre-colonial/Iron Age past. In broad terms the work is conducive to the 
development of more textured and nuanced historical constructions through its 
holistic approach to archaeological materials and variables. Specifically it has made 
significant contributions in four main areas: chronological issues, conceptual issues, 
geographical gaps and socio-political gaps:  
1. The lack of archaeological research in Rwanda over the past 30 years has 
prevented the generation of new radiocarbon dates and has left many outstanding 
chronological issues. Thus, this research directly tackled the early dates for the 
appearance of roulette-decorated ceramics in Rwanda and found the uncritical 
acceptance of the earliest margins of these dates to be at fault. This has helped to 
change explanations of how the shift from Urewe to roulette ceramics took place by 
lessening the rapidity of the transition. Furthermore, this has enabled the 
exploration of other archaeological possibilities in the late 1st millennium AD such 
as the suggestion that devolved, or transitional, ceramics were produced in 
Rwanda, as has been identified elsewhere in Great Lakes Africa. Indeed a separate 
date from a sealed feature at Karama has allowed this period to be investigated in 
central Rwanda within this thesis.   
2. This research has tackled conceptual issues regarding the simplistic 
division of the past into homogenised opposing periods and opposing peoples. It 
has demonstrated that a variety of subsistence products were available for the 
occupants of individual sites and that where subsistence frontiers existed there 
was interaction across these negotiable boundaries. Similarly this research suggests 
that ceramic traditions like social groups didnt exist in opposition to one another 
but they were dynamic technologies undergoing historical transitions that may 
reflect wider socio-political changes.  
3. There are many geographical gaps in the archaeological record of Rwanda. 
Previous research has tended to focus on areas central to the history of the Rwandan 
Kingdom or to areas that surround administrative centres. This research addressed 
this issue by surveying previously unexplored regions and by surveying peripheral, 
frontier zones alongside more historically core political areas. For example, this 
research has shown that the north of Rwanda, previously little researched, has a 
rich, dynamic and historically situated past that can be explored archaeologically. 
This approach has also added to the promotion of a more socially varied past 
through exploiting historically and geographically contrasting regions. 
4. The social history of Rwanda is poorly understood and outside of court 
representations there is little tangible evidence. This socio-political gap reflects gaps 
in the record across Great Lakes Africa, especially in the Early Iron Age, which is 
notorious for preserving poor contextual data. Instead archaeologists must rely 
upon oral historical accounts for the later periods and linguistic evidence for the 
earlier ones. Thus, although the Kabusanze burial has limited interpretative 
potential due to a lack of comparative material, it represents a fantastic opportunity 
to glimpse the social complexity that may have existed in the Early Iron Age. It hints 
at an Urewe burial pattern, including infant burials, the use of grave goods 
alongside the identification of Early Iron Age pathologies and long distance trade. 
Finally, in a contrasting region and period, the rich archaeological material from the 
Virunga caves has helped explore the complex life-ways and relations of the cave 
occupants. 
10.2 Public Archaeology Consequences 
There is a high potential for public-archaeology products to be generated from this 
research (discussed later under future directions). Indeed, the research has already 
been productive in the public sphere and the long process of public dissemination 
and feedback that will be necessary for this work to achieve its long-term goals has 
begun. For example, regular informal public presentations were undertaken in the 
areas in which work was carried out in order to keep local communities informed 
about our work and to explain the archaeological landscape that existed around 
them, including presentation of archaeological materials to be handled by the 
audience. These updates were continued more formally back at INMR in the form of 
monthly newsletters for distribution to visitors and members. However, whilst 
these are valuable dissemination methods and important public relations exercises, 
they are limited in scope. Thus, a medium was sought with greater potential impact.  
Following larger unsuccessful bids, the research raised 10,000 from the 
Commonwealth to fund a film about the subjective political construction of history 
in Rwanda that documented how new archaeological research was reconstructing 
the past in a new climate of reconciliation. The purpose of the film was to stimulate 
evidence based debate in Rwanda in a variety of communities. The film, Piecing 
Together Rwandas Past received consensual backing from the INMR and was 
produced by Banyak Productions, a UK film company. Over twenty minutes the 
film discusses the potential positive impact of archaeological research in the context 
of Rwandas contested past through interviews with government heritage 
professionals such as Professor Celestin Kanimba Misago, and Maurice 
Mugabowagahunde, a junior researcher from INMR, alongside media presenters 
including national radio hosts, and the author. Filming also followed a stage of the 
research in the Virunga Caves. The film was recorded in Kinyarwanda (the 
Rwandan national language), English and French, and includes subtitles.  
The final edit of the film was completed in February 2008 and was submitted to the 
Rwanda film festival held in March of that year. Despite its very late entry to this 
established event, it was immediately included and was shown at all venues, 
including the opening and closing events in Kigali and Butare that were attended by 
President Paul Kagame, amongst other dignitaries. As part of the festival the film 
toured rural areas of the country over two weeks being shown daily for free to 
audiences of 100s and 1000s on a large mobile cinema screen. Unfortunately it has 
not been possible to generate formal feedback from the festival audiences because 
the film was included at very short notice. However, the museum staff and festival 
organisers reported that it was well received and that they would be very happy for 
our input again in the future. Since the film festival, the film has been officially 
accepted by the INMR and is now on regular show in the museum on large flat 
screen televisions. It is also currently freely available online via UCLs itunes web 
page. 
The success of this reception must be emphasised. The film deals with very difficult 
issues in Rwanda that are often considered too dangerous or illegal to debate. For 
example it explicitly tackles presentations of pre-colonial social-exclusivity. Thus, 
the successful inclusion of this film in a national event and national institution 
demonstrates the potential for a politically engaged archaeology in Rwanda and 
suggests that educational archaeology may be possible in the future. Furthermore, 
the use of the film by the museum at international post-conflict conferences is a sign 
that this approach may be successfully applied to other non-Rwandan contexts. For 
example, Maurice Mugabowagahunde took the film on the instruction of the INMR 
to the 2008 International Peace Conference, Angkor, Cambodia to be shown at the 
session on Youth and Reconciliation: Together Searching for Justice and Acting for 
Peace. Maurice reported that it was enthusiastically received and, whilst it is again 
difficult to formally measure the feedback, it is a clear demonstration of the 
willingness of individuals and institutions to engage with tangible archaeological 
evidence instead of colonial historical constructions.  
10.3 Future Directions 
Although this research has produced considerable and significant findings and has 
begun to address the issues set out in the introductory chapters, it is recognised that 
further archaeological research in Rwanda is needed to create many more narratives 
and to develop the ones identified. Furthermore, whilst this research has managed 
to generate and explore non-ethno-racial pasts that do not repeat the genocidal 
constructions of eternally opposed social groups, it is recognised that much work is 
needed to explore this in more detail and to judge how best to incorporate this 
information within secondary school education. There is also the likelihood that 
data produced by this research could be removed from the theoretical framework 
established here and twisted to fit an ethno-racial construction of pre-colonial 
Rwanda. Unfortunately, whilst it is believed that the data presented here does not 
support such an approach it is very difficult to prevent this from happening as 
Rwandas past continues to be contested. 
 A few suggested areas for future research attention include: 
- Geographical Coverage  There are still large areas of Rwanda that have 
never been surveyed or considered archaeologically and these are often frontier 
regions at the borders of modern Rwanda. For example, the Akagera National Park 
in eastern Rwanda presents a prime opportunity for archaeological survey, being 
free from human settlement, having never been systematically surveyed (although 
Lugan 1983 did attempt some limited survey) and being a region which lay at the 
intersection between the Kingdoms of Rwanda (Nyiginya), Burundi and Bugeresa, 
Gisaka, Mubari, Ndorwa in the late 2nd millennium AD (Vansina 2004: 111). There is 
also potential for survey along the border with Burundi since the recent outbreak of 
peace in that country has reduced the danger of rebel incursions in this region. It is 
important that more pasts are explored to make Rwandas history more inclusive 
and to make this approach more applicable to the majority of Rwandans who want 
to understand the variety of their past.  
- Methodological approaches  Although the test-excavation units employed 
in this research represent an increase in exposure they are still primarily focused on 
exposing vertical stratigraphic relations in order to better understand the 
chronological development of sites. However, in order to access greater social 
information, to increase our understanding of the variety of experience in Rwanda, 
and thus develop richer pasts, we must employ excavation strategies with a greater 
horizontal emphasis. For example, future research could include a return to 
Kabusanze to expose a much greater area and to explore if there are more burials 
cut into the natural gravels, perhaps even a necropolis as seen at Tongo and Sanga. 
Alternatively, more expansive excavation could be undertaken in the Virunga caves 
in order to further understand the life ways of the cave occupants in the 2nd 
millennium AD.  
- Public Engagement and Dissemination  The inspiration and motivation 
for this research was the contemporary political context in Rwanda, including the 
racialised past and the failure to return pre-colonial history to the secondary school 
syllabus. Whilst this research has successfully identified and explored non-ethno-
racial pasts in the Rwandan Iron Age, and has indicated the potential reception of 
this approach by the use of documentary film, clearly there is much more work and 
many more exercises to do before archaeology may be considered for official 
acceptance within the syllabus. In order to develop the educational archaeological 
approach in Rwanda more formal feedback exercises and workshops are needed.  
For example, it would be beneficial to work with the filmmakers again and to tour 
the film with educationalists and archaeological materials around public centres in 
the areas in which the work was undertaken to stimulate discussion. The 
filmmakers would record the process whilst Rwandan educationalists record 
responses to which the project could be responsive. This would contribute to a final 
package that could be submitted to the Rwandan Ministry of Education, presenting 
the results of this exercise and the potential and limitations identified in relation to 
application of this approach in Rwanda. 
Key to the success of this approach will be whether the education department and 
government are receptive to the idea that pre-colonial Rwanda is not just a history 
of the kingdom and its court but has the potential to include the full variety of 
human experience within its modern borders. Moreover, the successful 
implementation of a participatory, evidence based, approach to history teaching will 
be necessary. Whilst this approach has previously failed to gain sustained 
government support it has never been approached archaeologically. Thus, through 
greater awareness of the potential of educational archaeology in post-identity-based 
conflicts it is believed this is possible.  
These challenges will not be easy to overcome, particularly that of incorporating 
archaeology into post-genocide debates in the non-academic sphere. However, it is 
believed that this thesis has made a significant archaeological contribution to the 
development of more complex and dynamic presentations of Rwandas pre-colonial 
past that can contribute to a better-informed and more integrated future.

Human Bones Report for Kabusanze (BPS036) 
Dr Anna Clement 
Adult Skeleton 
This skeleton was discovered in the lower part of the burial pit. Only elements from 
the upper part of the skeleton were present. These included elements of the cranial 
and post-cranial skeleton. 
Cranial bones 
Flat bone fragments of the skull, fragments of the sphenoid bone, left and right 
zygomatic bones, mandible and maxilla. 
Post cranial bones 
Rib fragments, parts of the vertebrae, including the atlas and the axis and the distal 
end and partial shaft of a right humerus.   
Dentition 
Upper - third molars, second molars, first molars, fourth premolars, third 
premolars, canines, right second incisor and left first incisor. 
Lower  left third molar (impacted), left second molar, right first molar, fourth 
premolars, third premolars, canines, second incisors and first incisors.  
The upper third molars are fully erupted, indicating that this is an adult skeleton.  
The best indictor of age in the adult human skeleton is the innominate bone of the 
pelvis (Buikstra & Ubelaker 1994). However, neither the left nor right innominate 
bone was found within the burial pit, so it is not possible to age the skeleton in this 
way. Tooth wear can also been used to age adult human skeletons.  The teeth show 
moderate amounts of tooth wear with patches of dentine exposed on most of their 
occlusal surfaces. However, without more comparative skeletal material it is 
impossible to place it within a young adult, adult, or mature adult age category.   
The best indicators for age in the adult human skeleton are also found within the 
pelvic region, but features of the skull can also be used (Buikstra & Ubelaker 1994).  
The mandible is extremely well preserved in this adult skeleton and provides the 
best indicator of sex. The size and robustness of the mandible strongly suggest that 
this skeleton represents a large and robust adult male.   
The Dentition 
This individual possesses some non-metrical variations within its dentition. The 
upper right second incisor shows an atypical morphology know as a peg-shape, a 
variation commonly observed in modern humans. In addition, the upper left second 
incisor is absent and it seems reasonable to suggest that it was congenitally absent 
as this is another morphological variation that is commonly associated with a peg-
shaped counterpart (Hillson 1996). In the lower dentition both the left first molar 
and the right second and third molars are absent. The lower left first molar appears 
to have been lost ante-mortem. Its surrounding alveolar bone shows evidence for a 
large abscess, which probably caused the tooth to be lost. The alveolar bone located 
in the region of the lower right second and third molars does not show any evidence 
of abscesses and it is possible that both these teeth were congenitally absent. It is 
not, however, possible to confirm this without x-raying the bone. 
Several of the teeth also show evidence for caries (dental decay) and infection.  The 
pulp chamber of the upper left first incisor has been exposed through a major 
fracture of the tooth crown resulting in the formation of a large abscess at the apex 
of the root.   
Summary 
The human skeleton discovered in the lower part of the burial represents a large 
adult male. The elements of this adult skeleton that were discovered within the pit 
are well-preserved and the absence of the rest of the skeleton therefore requires 
further explanation. One possibility is differential preservation within the burial pit.  
However, the missing elements of the skeleton include the bones of the pelvis and 
the legs. These represent some of the largest and strongest bones in the human 
skeleton and it seems unlikely that small fragments of ribs would be preserved 
within the burial pit and not parts of these larger bones. In addition the partial 
humerus is extremely well-preserved, but none of the other long bones of the arm 
were discovered. The depth of the deposit also means that the bones were unlikely 
to have been disturbed post burial. An alternative explanation is that only select 
parts of the skeleton were buried. This is supported by the presence of cut marks on 
both the mandible and the humerus, as well as a possible peri-mortem fracture on 
the shaft of the humerus. These are possible indications of violence and/or 
defleshing. The fracture and cut marks need to be examined and evaluated further 
before any firm conclusions can be made.   
Neonate Skeleton 
This skeleton of a neonate was discovered approximately 0.5m above the adult 
skeleton and was extremely well preserved.  It included most of the major elements 
of the skeleton 
Cranial bones 
Flat bones of the skull, including identifiable fragments of the parietal, occipital and 
frontal bones; left greater wind of the sphenoid; the left petrous bone with partial 
squamous and tympanic ring, and a small fragment of mandible.  
Post-cranial bones present: 
Left scapula, left humerus, left and right ulna, left radius, distal fragment of the 
right radius, ribs, right ilium, left and right femur, left and right tibia, left fibula, 
metapodials and phalanges. 
Dentition 
No teeth were recovered. 
The maximum length of the major long bones as well as elements of the skull can 
provide estimates for age-at-death in the neonate skeleton (Scheuer & Black 2004).  
Measurements were taken for each of the complete long bones as well as the petrous 
bone and are listed in the table below. 
Bone Measurement (mm) Bone Measurement (mm) 
Left femur 77 Right femur 78 
Left tibia 67 Right tibia 66 
Left fibula 61 Left ulna 61 
Left radius 55 Left petrous 43 
All of these measurements fall within the range of a full-term neonate with an age-
at-death of around the time of birth (Scheuer & Black 2004). This is supported by the 
fusion of the petrous bone and tympanic ring in this skeleton, which also occurs at 
around the time of birth  
It is currently extremely difficult to sex a neonate skeleton because the main sex 
related changes in the human skeleton do not occur until adolescence (Scheuer & 
Black 2004).  A reliable sex estimate can not therefore be provided for this skeleton. 
Summary 
This extremely well-preserved skeleton represents the remains of a neonate with an 
age-at-death of around the time of birth.  It is possible that the infant survived the 
first few weeks after birth, but this is impossible to confirm without detailed 
analysis of the associated dentition.

Metallographic Analysis of two iron objects from 
an Early Iron Age burial in Southern Rwanda 
Jane Humphris (UCL) 
Introduction 
In 2007, John Giblin (PhD candidate, UCL Institute of Archaeology), excavated a 
number of iron objects from an Early Iron Age burial in Southern Rwanda, a region 
renowned for some of the earliest iron production in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is 
known that the artisans of the period constructed their furnaces partly using 
decorated clay bricks, which were assembled over a pit within which slag drained 
during the smelt. This decoration has been likened to that observed on 
contemporary Urewe ceramics (Van Grunderbeek et al 2001), although the purpose 
of this stylistic choice is still debated (Schmidt 1996: 221). Little is known about how 
these early ironworkers controlled the smelting parameters to produce enough 
metal to make the resource and labour thirsty job of iron production worthwhile 
(however see Craddock et al 2007). Furthermore, largely due to Rwandas very wet 
climate (creating the perfect corrosive environment for such objects), no information 
regarding the iron metal that was being produced during these early periods has 
been available until now.  
A date of AD 417 to 554 (2 sigma calibration) has been obtained for the burial, 
within which the conditions were not only adequate enough to preserve iron 
objects, but also human bone, alongside beautifully decorated Urewe vessels, beads 
and a cowry shell which must have travelled all the way from the Indian Ocean. 
Thus it can be said from the outset that this was a high status burial, with trouble 
taken to fill the grave with prestigious grave goods. The iron objects were all body 
adornments, including two bracelets, one necklet, and one hollow iron disk (fig. 1). 
The fact that these iron items are made to be decorative, and that the person 
wearing them may well have been a high status individual, provide the first insight 
into the use of iron produced during these early periods.  
On arrival at UCL these objects were assigned to Kelly Caldwell, an MSc 
Conservation student, for conservation treatment. She initially cleaned the objects to 
remove as much corrosion as possible, and then stabilised them in preparation for 
display in the National Museum of Rwanda (mindful of the Museums lack of 
climate control facilities).

Metallographic methods 
One sample was taken from the end point of the necklet (sample A), and one from a 
bracelet (sample B), after permission was obtained for such sampling from the 
National Museum of Rwanda. These sampling areas were selected to cause limited 
damage to the overall appearance of the objects. Additionally, the choice of 
sampling was influenced by x-rays of the objects, which illustrated that while much 
of the iron metal within the iron disc had corroded (presumably due to its flatter 
shape, at only a few mm thick, and so greater ratio of surface area to iron metal), the 
integrity of the metal within the iron necklet and bracelets was more significantly 
preserved (fig. 2).  
Fig. 2. X-ray taken of the objects displaying the level of corrosion affecting the iron metal (X-ray 
courtesy of Kelly Caldwell). 
The samples were slowly sawn off using a slow-speed mini Dremel saw. Using a 
larger instrument (such as a tile cutter), although quicker, may have generated too 
much heat and thus affected both the metal structure as well as the integrity of the 
objects themselves. Standard laboratory techniques were used to mount the samples 
in epoxy resin blocks, with the largest cross-section possible visible for laboratory 
examination. The resin blocks were polished down to a grain size of 0.25 m 
following established procedures, producing a mirror-like finish.  
The hardness of the samples was tested using the Vickers Micro-hardness test, 
which subjects the metal to a certain load (100g in this case) using the microscopic 
point of a diamond pyramid to make a small indentation within the surface of the 
metal. The size of this indentation is dependant on the resistance of the metal, and is 
measured under a microscope. The measurement of the pyramid is then matched to 
a scale of hardness (Bailey 1972: 168-169; Scott 1991: 77). Optical microscopy 
utilising plane polarised light (PPL), was used to provide a general view of the 
samples. Following this the samples were etched in nital for 1-3 minutes to reveal 
the internal microstructures, and then carbon coated and examined using the SEM-
EDS to provide greater understanding of both the microstructure and phase 
compositions.   
Results 
A significant amount of time and technical skill was used to form the shape of these 
objects. The necklet and the bracelets appear to be square in section, suggesting that 
the iron was hammered down four sides and then gradually bent, possibly around 
an object with the desired circumference. However, the metal within both of these 
iron objects is heavily dominated by slag inclusions (fig. 3), indicating that the iron 
was not hammered consistently over a long period of time with the aim of expelling 
the slag inclusions. Although in some types of iron objects such a factor would have 
been detrimental to the overall structural strength (the slag inclusions causing 
weakness to the body of the items), in decorative adornments such as these, this 
would not have presented a problem. The slight flattening of some of the slag 
inclusions, while others remain un-flattened and with a variety of shapes and 
orientations again indicate that it was the shape of the objects, rather that the purity 
of the iron metal, which was the main concern for the smith.  
                                                                                      Iron metal 
                                                                                                  Iron slag inclusion 
                                                                                    Corrosion   
Fig. 3. Photomicrograph of sample A, illustrating an iron metal matrix densely packed with slag 
inclusions present in a variety of shapes and orientations (PPL 50x, image width 2mm).  
Interestingly the majority of the slag inclusions remain un-corroded and with 
unreduced iron oxide phases (mainly wstite), as well as hercynite (indicative of the 
alumina rich slags of the region), still present (fig. 4). SEM-EDS analysis confirmed 
the presence of these phases, with the wstite present within a kalcilitic matrix 
enriched with lime, and fayalite also present (as would be expected within bloomery 
slag). Thus in the future, microprobe analysis could be used to identify chemical 
signatures within the slag inclusions and provenance study could be conducted to 
identify the source of the iron. As it is known that a significant amount of iron was 
being produced in Southern Rwanda, Northern Burundi and North-west Tanzania 
at this time, it would be interesting to either confirm a local source, or suggest that 
these objects had been traded from elsewhere (similar to the cowry shell also 
discovered in the burial).

Iron metal 
Wstite  
Both of the objects were primarily classified by Vickers Hardness readings of 
between 197 Hv - 279 Hv (fig. 5), indicative of low carbon ferrite, as would be 
expected in bloomery iron that has been forged into an object. The carbon content of 
the iron is variable within the objects, again characteristic of bloomery iron (Scott 
1991: 89). In this case, a maximum hardness of 657 Hv was recorded on the outside 
edge of sample A, suggesting an elevated carbon content, presumably resulting 
from an episode of heating during forging.

When etched with nital (dilute nitric acid), the structure of the metal was revealed 
(Scott 1991: 69). In both iron samples a matrix dominated by large-grained low-
carbon ferrite zones is obvious (fig. 6). The grain boundaries indicate typical, cube-
like structures, as would be expected from bloomery iron where the iron cools 
quickly during the forging of the desired shape (Rostoker and Dvorak 1965: 10; 
Ryzewski and Gordon 2008: 52). The slightly increased carbon content was also 
highlighted towards the outer edge of sample A, where pearlite is visible (fig. 7: see 
Rostoker and Dvorak 1965: 135). This suggests that the objects had been placed back 
in the forge towards the end of the process and thus the carbon content in some 
areas had become elevated.

Discussion 
This first analysis of iron objects produced during the Early Iron Age in Rwanda has 
finally provided an insight into the use of at least some of the iron objects made 
during this early period. As described above, the grave goods represented within 
this excavation indicate a high-status, important burial. That this person was 
adorned with decorative objects made from iron indicates that the metal was being 
used to produce luxury items for high status individuals.  
The iron objects were made by one or more skilled smiths capable of shaping iron 
into long strands and then shaping it to produce what would have been very 
symmetrical circles. The circular disc also highlights the technical skills of the 
artisan, being flat yet round with a hole through the middle - presumably a very 
difficult shape to achieve. The bracelets appear to have small pieces of iron heat 
sealed onto them (fig. 1), although the original appearance is unknown. Clearly the 
specialist hammering skills of the smith were impressive, despite the high levels of 
slag remaining in the metal. Either a choice was made that for this purpose the effort 
to expel more slag was unnecessary, or the implications of a large slag inclusion 
content was unknown. Unfortunately, without comparative objects made for 
different purposes (ideally a hoe and/or spear dating to the same period), if any 
such items were fabricated from iron at this time, the high level of slag inclusions 
within these objects remains difficult to interpret. The same can be said for the type 
of iron produced. As mentioned, certain areas of these objects contained higher 
carbon contents, which are interpreted here as an accident resulting from the objects 
being left in the forge too long. Ferritic iron (produced by bloomery smelting and 
primary forging), is malleable and easy to work, although this becomes more 
difficult as the carbon content increases. However, where a strong edge is required, 
for example for a knife or spear, an elevation in carbon content would aid the 
purpose of the object by creating a particularly tough edge. Further analysis of a 
variety of iron objects dating to this period could indicate whether in fact this higher 
carbon level was achieved on purpose, and so whether or not the smiths of the time 
in fact recognise the hardening effects of leaving objects in the forge for slightly 
longer than really necessary. 
These objects are now back in the National Museum of Rwanda, serving to illustrate 
the technological prowess of Rwandas ancient iron workers. The insight into 
society that has been provided by the excavation of this burial and its combined 
grave goods is fascinating. Not only was iron apparently viewed as a prestige good 
- adorning the body of a clearly important individual - but it could also be 
intricately worked during these very early periods. The variety of iron objects 
within the grave (necklet, two bracelets and an iron disc) designed to decorate 
different parts of the body, could be suggested to have vague parallels with the 
approach to the intricate decoration of furnaces and of Urewe ceramics during the 
period. As research continues, the sophisticated technological skills of the artisans of 
the time, and the care that was taken to embellish and adorn many aspects of 
society, are constantly being recognised.
