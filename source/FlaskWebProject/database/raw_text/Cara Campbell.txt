Abstract  
In recent years, the interest in the use of home grown protein sources for 
the dairy industry has increased due to fluctuations in cost and availability of 
soyabean meal (SBM). Forage legumes have been of particular interest due to 
their high crude protein content, ranging between 170 to 220 g/kg DM. Protein in 
forage legumes is degraded rapidly within the rumen, however a high yielding 
dairy cow requires high levels of by-pass protein to maintain milk yield. Tannins 
are phenolic compounds that can bind to forage protein in the silo or rumen, 
providing protection from microbial breakdown, before dissociating in the small 
intestine, increasing the amount of by-pass protein available from the forage 
legume. Studies were therefore conducted to evaluate the effects of tannins, either 
naturally occurring or added to forage legumes at ensiling, on the nutritive value, 
nitrogen utilisation and performance of high yielding dairy cows. In the first study, 
the effect of the addition of condensed or hydrolysable tannins at inclusion rates of 
0, 25, 50 or 75 g/kg DM at ensiling on the nutritional value of forage legumes was 
investigated. Forage source influenced all nutritional values including DM, CP, 
ash, NDF and ammonia nitrogen content, whilst forage DM content increased from 
329 to 364 g/kg as inclusion of tannin increased from 0 to 75 g/kg DM. Addition of 
tannins influenced forage pH with forages supplemented with condensed tannins 
having a higher pH than those supplemented with hydrolysable tannins. Forage 
pea silages have varying levels of naturally occurring condensed tannins and also 
a high crude protein content and the second study investigated the effect of the 
inclusions of forage pea silages differing in tannin content on dairy cow 
performance. Dairy cows fed pea silage containing low levels of condensed tannin 
had the lowest dry matter intake whilst milk yield was highest in cows fed grass 
silage. Similarly, milk protein was highest in cows fed grass silage, but there was 
no effect of treatment on milk fat content. Milk fat content of C18:2 n-6 was highest 
in cows when fed grass silage (P < 0.001), whilst C18:3 n-3 was highest in cows 
fed pea silage containing high levels of tannin. In comparison to forage pea 
silages, lucerne and red clover silages have limited amounts of naturally occurring 
tannins but also have a high content of crude protein. The addition of hydrolysable 
tannins at ensiling can bind to the forage protein in the silo improving the 
availability of by-pass protein from the forage, therefore the third study 
investigated the addition of hydrolysable tannins at 25 g/kg DM to lucerne and red 
clover silage on the performance of lactating dairy cows. The inclusion of tannin 
had no effect on dairy cow performance, however forage source influenced dry 
matter intake with cows fed lucerne silage having the highest intake (P < 0.05), 
similarly, OM and N intake was highest in cows fed lucerne silage. In both dairy 
cow studies, DM, N and OM digestibility were not significantly affected by forage 
type or the presence of tannins. In conclusion, any commercial advantage from 
feeding forage legumes to high yielding dairy cows will be based on savings in N 
from fertiliser or dietary protein rather than animal performance, whilst tannins will 
have little effect on milk performance.

1.1 Introduction 
In the past 10 years, prices of soya bean meal (SBM; Glycine max) have 
fluctuated due to an increase in global demand from different industries including 
the ruminant industry (Figure 1). The volatility in cost and availability of SBM has 
produced a greater interest in the use of home grown protein sources by the UK 
ruminant industry. Forage legumes have an ability to fix nitrogen and grow well in 
temperate regions like the UK, therefore offer a potential home grown source of 
protein for dairy cows. Forage legumes contain a high level of rumen degrabable 
protein however, high yielding dairy cows require high levels of rumen 
undegradable (by-pass) protein to improve and maintain high milk yields of above 
35 kg per day. Forage legumes are unable to provide the high by-pass protein 
requirements of a high yielding dairy cow. Therefore, research of ways to reduce 
rapid degradation of protein from forage legumes in the rumen is necessary to 
make home grown forage legumes a viable source of protein to the UK dairy 
industry.  
1.2  Use of purchased protein in UK dairy industry 
Supplementary protein sources, such as SBM or rapeseed meal (Brassica napus), 
contribute a large part to a ruminants diet (Wilkinson, 2011). Price and availability 
of SBM to the ruminant market is dependent on the demands and use of SBM as 
the main source of protein for the monogastric agricultural industry in the UK 
(Wilkinson, 2011). Increased global demand for these supplementary protein 
sources and associated fluctuations in availability and price has resulted in greater 
interest in the utilisation of home grown, protein-rich forage sources for ruminants 
(Hart et al., 2011). Over the past 10 years, price of SBM has ranged between 200 
and 400 per tonne, peaking in September 2012 and lowest in October 2008 
(Figure 1). From September 2012, the price per tonne decreased but peaked 
rapidly in July 2016 at 335 per tonne; in March 2018 the price per tonne was 
334.

1.3  Digestion and metabolism of forage legumes by dairy cows 
Forage legumes have been studied intensively as a forage source for ruminants 
(Broderick et al., 2001; Moorby et al., 2009; Hart et al., 2011; Arndt et al., 2015). 
Studies have considered the nutritive value of the silage, intake, rumen 
fermentation, whole tract digestion, milk production and composition, and 
efficiency of nitrogen use (Hoffman et al., 1998; Sinclair et al., 2009; Leduc et al., 
2017; Broderick et al., 2000).  
1.3.1 Nutritive value 
For alternative forages, like forage peas, lucerne and red clover, to be successful 
in the dairy industry, the nutritive value must be compared to conventional forages, 
like grass, to ensure their viability (Mustafa et al., 2002). The nutritive value of 
forage legumes and grass silage are summarised in Table 1. Forage legumes can 
provide a higher level of crude protein (CP) and starch than traditional grass 
silages (Mustafa et al., 2000). In traditional rations cereal crops, such as maize or 
whole crop wheat, are incorporated in the diet to provide fermentable 
carbohydrate, however some legume silages can contain higher levels of starch 
reducing the need for large quantities of cereal crops (Mustafa et al., 2000). 
Forage pea silages can produce high DM contents of between 300 and 400 g/kg 
when harvested at growth stage 206 (Fraser et al., 2001). In a study conducted by 
Sinclair et al. (2009), forage pea silages had a DM content that was 107 g/kg 
higher than grass silage at a mean value of 351 g/kg. Likewise, Hart et al. (2011) 
reported a DM content of 324 g/kg for pea silages, however the grass silage had a 
higher dry matter content of 403 g/kg.  
Similarly, lucerne and red clover silage can have high DM contents. Broderick et 
al. (2001) reported a DM content of 520 and 358 g/kg for lucerne and red clover 
silage, respectively. However, the DM content of these silages can be variable 
with Broderick et al. (2000) reporting values of 392 and 448 g/kg for lucerne and 
red clover silage, respectively. Grass silage tends to have a lower or similar dry 
matter content to forage legumes with a range of 249  375 g/kg (Moorby et al., 
2009; Dewhurst et al., 2003; Vanhatalo et al., 2009). It is known that timing of 
mowing and wilting is critical to the final DM content of the silage; dry, warm and 
windy weather conditions can increase the DM of the crop by wilting and removing 
water accumulated from rain and dew (Wilkinson, 2005).  
A key nutritive value difference between forage legumes and grass silages is CP 
content with forage legumes ranging between 177 and 228 g/kg DM, whereas 
grass silage tends to be lower, ranging between 111 and 206 g/kg DM (Table 1). 
Sinclair et al. (2009) and Hart et al. (2011) reported values of between 177 and 
197 g/kg DM for white and coloured pea silages, respectively. In contrast, grass 
silage was lower, ranging between 119 and 121 g/kg DM in the study of Hart et al. 
(2011) and Sinclair et al. (2009). Similarly, Fraser et al. (2001) observed high CP 
values of 228, 200 and 204 g/kg DM for forage pea silage harvested at 10, 12 and 
14 weeks post sowing, respectively. Even though, CP content declined as harvest 
date post sowing increased for the forage pea silages, levels did not fall below 200 
g/kg DM, which is higher than grass silage.  
Broderick et al. (2001) conducted two studies that included red clover and lucerne 
silage that was harvested in two separate years. The CP content for both forages 
varied between 179 g/kg and 217 g/kg DM, with the red clover silage having a 
lower CP than lucerne silage in both years, averaging 185 and 204 g/kg DM, 
respectively. In contrast, in a previous study by Broderick et al. (2000) the 
difference in CP content between red clover and lucerne silage was 36 g/kg DM 
compared to the 19 g/kg DM difference reported by Broderick et al. (2001). These 
slight differences in CP content are in agreement with Hymes-Fecht et al. (2013) 
who reported a 39 g/kg DM difference between red clover and lucerne silage.  
In a study conducted by Hoffman et al. (1998), lucerne silage had a slightly higher 
CP content of 202 g/kg DM whereas grass silage was slightly lower at 184 g/kg 
DM. Similarly, Moorby et al. (2009) reported that grass silage had a CP content of 
206 g/kg DM whereas red clover silage was comparable at 194 g/kg DM. Maturity 
at harvest can affect the CP content of grass silage, and in Hoffman et al. (1998) 
the grass silage was a late summer cut which may have contributed to the high CP 
content observed. In a study conducted by Vanhatalo et al. (2009), grass and red 
clover silages were harvested at two maturity levels, early (early heading = grass; 
preflowering = red clover) and late (heading = grass; early flowering). For both 
forages, CP content declined from early to late harvest, with grass silage declining 
from 134 to 111 g/kg DM and red clover declining from 212 to 181 g/kg DM.  
Some forage legumes have a high starch content in comparison to grass silage 
therefore and consequently, there is an opportunity to reduce the reliance on 
cereal crops in the rations of dairy cows. Starch levels in lucerne and red clover 
silage are low, and comparable to grass silage, Halmemies-Beauchet-Filleau et al. 
(2014) observed a higher starch content of red clover silage at 16.3 g/kg DM 
compared to a starch content of 10.3 g/kg DM in grass silage. Starch content of 
lucerne silage tends to be higher than red clover silage and Benchaar et al. (2007) 
reported it at 176 g/kg DM. In contrast, starch content of forage peas and beans 
are higher and were variable when measured by Sinclair et al. (2009) and Hart et 
al. (2011). Sinclair et al. (2009) reported a higher starch content of 87 g/kg DM in 
white pea silage whereas red pea silage was 29 g/kg DM lower at 58 g/kg DM. In 
contrast, Hart et al. (2011) reported white pea silage having a lower starch content 
of 63 g/kg DM while red pea silage was 10 g/kg DM higher. Starch content of pea 
silage can be affected by the age at which the crop is harvested, and Fraser et al. 
(2001) observed an increase in starch content from 19.2 to 124.9 g/kg DM from 10 
to 14 weeks post sowing. Starch content can also vary between species of pea 
silage, with Mustafa et al. (2002) reporting a difference between Lenca, Carneval 
and Delta at 68, 92 and 103 g/kg DM, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded 
that forage legumes such as peas or beans have a higher starch content than 
grass silage although maturity and variety of the legume can influence starch 
content.

1.3.2  Intake  
Voluntary intake by dairy cows depends upon the forage physical and chemical 
characteristics, with one of the most important characteristic of a forage being its 
fibre content (Bertilsson and Murphy, 2003). The rate at which feed is cleared from 
the rumen can affect dry matter (DM) intake, an important factor in this clearance 
is the particle size (less than 2mm) of feed after chewing (Waghorn et al., 1989). A 
summary of the effects of forage legume inclusion on DM intake is provided in 
Table 2. In a study conducted by Moorby et al. (2009) red clover silage partially or 
totally replaced grass silage in the diet of dairy cows, with DM intake increasing 
with the inclusion of red clover silage. The difference in intake of grass and red 
clover silage in the study of Moorby et al. (2009) was suggested to be due to the 
difference in particle size. Particle size of forages affects the rumen fill rates 
leading to a change in feed intake by the cow (Dewhurst et al., 2003). Red clover 
is known to have a smaller particle size than grass silage, therefore allowing a 
larger feed intake. In a study by Hymes-Fecht et al. (2013) dairy cows fed red 
clover silage had a larger DM intake of 25.6 kg/d whilst cows fed lucerne silage 
had a lower DM intake of 24.7 kg/d. Waghorn et al. (1989) investigated the 
breakdown of fresh lucerne and ryegrass in the rumen, and reported that lucerne 
particles decreased in size at a faster rate than ryegrass. It was therefore 
concluded that lucerne passed through the rumen more rapidly allowing more 
protein from the feed to escape degradation in the rumen and reach the intestines 
to be digested than ryegrass. Waghorn et al. (1989) also concluded that for 
particles to move through the reticulo-rumen freely, the optimal size is 2 mm or 
less. Dewhurst et al. (2003a) also concluded that particles of 2 mm or less of 
forage legumes would move through the reticulo-rumen freely increasing rumen 
outflow. Rumen outflow was highest in cows fed lucerne silage, and lowest in 
cows fed grass silage (Dewhurst et al. 2003a). 
In a study conducted by Mustafa et al. (2000), dairy cows were offered pea, barley 
or lucerne silage, at a 50:50 forage: concentrate ratio (DM basis), and reported 
there was no effect on DM intake which were 28.6, 27.5 and 26.0 kg/d for pea, 
lucerne and barley silage, respectively. In contrast, Adesogan et al. (2004) 
reported that forage DM intake of cows offered pea-wheat silage was 18.3 kg/d 
which averaged 3.65 kg/d more than cows offered grass silage with DM intake of 
16.5kg/d. The difference in DM intake in the study by Adesogan et al. (2004) was 
suggested to be due to characteristics of peas in intercrop silage that improved 
intake. A high starch content and high CP content are characteristics that are 
considered to improve intakes of dairy cows (Adesogan et al., 2004). In two 
separate studies, Broderick et al., (2000) and Broderick et al., (2001), replaced 
lucerne silage with red clover silage and reported that DM intake was lower in 
dairy cows that had been fed red clover silage. Hymes-Fecht et al. (2013) 
investigated the effects of birdsfoot trefoil silage with varying levels (8  16 g/kg 
DM) of condensed tannin as a replacement for red clover and lucerne silage. 
Forage legume source had no effect on DM intake of the dairy cows and it was 
concluded that the condensed tannins were not at a concentration to cause a 
depression in intake.  
1.3.3 Rumen Fermentation 
Ruminants are animals with a specialised digestive tract containing four stomach 
compartments, reticulum, rumen, omasum and abomasum (McDonald et al., 2011) 
A ruminants feed will undergo extensive fermentation within the rumen prior to 
digestion in the abomasum and small intestine (Russell et al., 1992). The 
fermentation process is important as it will have a significant impact on the 
animals performance (Russell et al., 1992). The rumen is an anaerobic 
environment with a diverse microbial population including bacteria, fungi, protozoa, 
methanogenic archaea and bacteriophages in varying numbers (Morgavi et al., 
2010). The activity and presence of these microbes determine the quality of 
fermentation of feedstuffs that occurs in the rumen (Russell et al., 1992). The 
microbes benefit from the fermentation of different components of the feed, with 
carbohydrate fermentation providing an energy source for the microbes (Russell et 
al., 1992). The degradation of feed as seen in Figure 2 begins with polymers of 
protein and carbohydrate undergoing microbial hydrolysis by primary anaerobic 
fermenters to form monomers (Morgavi et al., 2010). Primary fermenters are 
capable of degrading protein and carbohydrate polymers to volatile fatty acids 
(VFA) and microbial protein without the assistance of secondary fermenters. 
However, primary anaerobic fermenters and secondary fermenters that are not 
capable of degradation of polymers are the microbes involved in the fermentation 
of monomers to CO2, H2, microbial protein and VFAs; acetate, propionate and 
butyrate (Figure 2; Morgavi et al., 2010). The animal is able to utilise these VFAs 
as an energy source, lactic acid can be produced in the rumen when fermentation

secondary fermenters 
becomes rapid (Russell et al., 1992). Following fermentation, propionate can be 
converted into glucose via gluconeogenesis in the liver; butyrate is mainly used as 
an energy source by the digestive tract (Dijkstra et al., 2012; Vlaeminck et al., 
2006). Acetate is absorbed across the rumen wall and may be used as energy 
source or is available for synthesis into milk fatty acids (Dijkstra et al., 2012; 
Vlaeminck et al., 2006).

Adapted from Morgavi et al. (2010). 
Rumen pH is normally between pH 5.0 to 7.0, however it can vary depending on 
the time of day and production of VFAs or lactic acid (Dijkstra et al., 2012). 
Following the ingestion of feed, rumen pH will fall due to the breakdown of 
carbohydrates to volatile fatty acids, and the accumulation of VFAs cause the 
decline in pH (Dijkstra et al., 2012). Rumen pH will rise as volatile fatty acids are

cleared from the rumen, however an accumulation of lactic acid will cause rumen 
pH to fall (Dijkstra et al., 2012). Leduc et al. (2017) observed a rumen pH of 6.53 
in dairy cows fed lucerne silage but a higher pH of 6.69 in dairy cows fed red 
clover silage, and it was concluded this difference in pH was due to the higher 
fibre content at 300 g/kg DM for the red clover silage. This increase in rumen pH 
was associated with a decrease in propionic acid concentration in cows fed red 
clover silage by 10 mM. In contrast, Vanhatalo et al. (2009) observed no difference 
in rumen pH when dairy cows were fed grass or red clover silage at pH 6.42 or pH 
6.38, respectively. However, cows fed red clover silage had a higher overall 
concentration of volatile fatty acids in the rumen at 117 mmol/L compared to cows 
fed grass silage in which volatile fatty acid concentration was 105 mmol/L. This 
lack of change in pH and difference in volatile fatty acid concentration was 
suggested to be due to the lower buffering capacity and substrates in grass silage 
being less fermentable than in red clover silage. 
In a study by Arndt et al. (2015) when the inclusion rate of lucerne silage in the 
diet increased from 20% to 80% there was no change in rumen pH which 
averaged pH 6.48. Similarly, there was no difference in the overall volatile fatty 
acid concentration as the rate of inclusion of lucerne silage increased, however 
levels of acetate increased while levels of propionate decreased as the inclusion of 
lucerne silage increased from 20% to 80%. Arndt et al. (2015) concluded these 
changes in acetate and propionate concentrations may have resulted from the 
lower amounts of maize silage starch available in the high inclusion diets. In a 
study conducted by Adesogan et al. (2004) two varieties of pea silage (Magnus 
and Setchey) were intercropped with wheat, and rumen pH was highest in cows 
fed grass silage (pH 6.69) whereas cows fed pea-wheat intercrop silage had a 
lower pH (pH 6.62). However, total volatile fatty acid concentration was highest in 
cows fed grass and Setchey-wheat silage at 79.5 and 76.4 mmol/L, respectively. 
Total volatile fatty acid concentration was lowest in the Magnus-wheat silage at 
67.4 mmol/L, and it was suggested these differences were due to differences in 
starch content of the silages as the breakdown of starch has a large impact on the 
volatile fatty acids that accumulate in the rumen. 
1.3.4 Whole tract digestion 
Whole tract digestibility of DM, CP, OM and NDF of feed can provide information 
about how efficiently each component of the feed has been digested by the 
ruminant. When pea (Magnus and Setchey) silages were intercropped with wheat 
in the study of Adesogan et al. (2004), DM, CP and OM digestibility was higher 
than in cows fed grass silage. Grass silage is degraded at a slower rate than pea 
silages in the rumen hence the lower digestibility of DM and OM in cows fed grass 
silage (Salawu et al., 2002a). Digestibility of NDF was higher in the cows fed 
Magnus-wheat silage than cows fed Setchey-wheat pea silage at 0.653 and 0.564 
g/g, respectively. Adesogan et al. (2004) suggested this difference in NDF 
digestibility between the two pea  wheat silages was due to the higher pea to 
wheat ratio in the Magnus-wheat silage therefore a higher ratio of silage that can 
be degraded rapidly.  
Previous studies have compared the differences in digestibility of grass silage to 
red clover or lucerne silage in a dairy cows diet. Halmemies-Beauchet-Filleau et 
al. (2014) reported a linear decline in DM, OM, NDF and N whole tract digestibility 
as the inclusion rate of red clover to grass silage increased from 0, 33, 67 to 
100%. Reductions in whole tract digestibility of DM, OM, NDF and N can indicate 
that the availability of nutrients in the rumen and small intestine are lowered 
(Halmemies-Beauchet-Filleau et al., 2014). The lower N digestibility in red clover 
silage may indicate a higher concentration of amino acids available from the 
forage protein supply rather than the microbial protein supply in the omasum, 
however these forage amino acids are not as readily absorbed (Halmemies-
Beauchet-Filleau et al., 2014). In contrast, Vanhatalo et al. (2009) reported no 
change in total tract OM digestibility between cows fed red clover silage or grass 
silage at 74.4 or 73.4 %, respectively. Despite no change due to silage type, the 
age of the silage at cutting caused a decline in total tract OM digestibility from 75.6 
to 72.1 % for early to late harvesting, respectively (Vanhatalo et al., 2009). Total 
tract N digestibility was lower in cows fed grass silage by 4.35 % compared to 
cows fed red clover silage in a study by Vanhatalo et al. (2009) study, although 
rumen N digestibility was lower in cows fed red clover silage (69.6% v 64.3%; 
grass v red clover silage). Similar to total tract OM digestibility, N digestibility was 
reduced by the maturity of the silage for both grass and red clover silages, 
averaging 70.6 and 68.5 % for early and late harvesting, respectively (Vanhatalo 
et al., 2009). Vanhatalo et al. (2009) concluded that the lower N digestibility in the 
rumen was influenced by the greater flow of non-ammonia N (NAN) from the 
rumen to the small intestine.  
Broderick et al. (2001) compared the apparent whole tract digestibility of cows fed 
either red clover or lucerne silage. Cows fed red clover silage had a higher whole 
tract digestibility for DM, OM, N and NDF compared to cows fed lucerne silage. 
The difference in NDF digestibility was suggested to be due to the different 
maturities of the silages with red clover silage being harvested as an early cut. 
Broderick et al. (2001) concluded that the higher N digestibility in red clover silage 
was due to an increase in N intake but there was, also 40 g/kg DM more soya 
bean meal included in the diet containing red clover silage, and consequently the 
availability of by-pass protein contained in SBM may be more readily degradable 
than protein in red clover silage which could have confounded these results.  
Digestibility of DM, OM and CP were 3.2, 3.0 and 5.2 % lower, respectively, when 
cows were fed lucerne silage compared to cows fed grass silage in a study 
conducted by Hoffman et al. (1998), although digestibility of NDF was similar 
between the two forages. Hoffman et al. (1998) suggested these differences in 
DM, OM and CP digestibility may be attributable to the difference observed in rate 
of passage, with cows fed lucerne silage having a quicker rate of passage by 0.81 
%/h. Arndt et al. (2015) observed no effect of an increase in lucerne to maize 
silage ratio from 20:80 to 80:20 on DM, OM and CP total tract digestibility 
averaging 70.2, 72.6 and 73.0 %, respectively. Although, NDF total tract 
digestibility increased linearly from 35.5 to 48.1% as lucerne silage inclusion rate 
increased from 20 to 80 %, respectively. Arndt et al. (2015) concluded that NDF 
present in lucerne silage was more digestible in the rumen than NDF in maize 
silage.  
In contrast, Sinclair et al. (2015) reported changes in DM, OM, N and NDF whole 
tract digestibility with different inclusion rates of lucerne silage replacing grass and 
maize silage in the diet of dairy cows. As the inclusion rate of lucerne in the diet 
increased from 0 to 60 %, there was a decline in DM and OM digestibility from 
0.712 to 0.655 kg/kg and 0.728 to 0.673 kg/kg, respectively. Similarly, a reduction 
from 0.712 to 0.673 kg/kg was observed in N digestibility as lucerne silage 
increased in the diet. Sinclair et al. (2015) suggested this change in N digestibility 
may be influenced by protein post rumen degradation being less in lucerne than 
SBM. Sinclair et al. (2015) reported contrasting results for NDF digestibility with a 
decline when lucerne silage replaced grass silage from 0.631 to 0.582 kg/kg, 
agreeing with the previous study of Hoffman et al. (1998). However, Sinclair et al. 
(2015) reported no change in NDF digestibility (0.519 kg/kg) when lucerne silage 
replaced maize silage (40:60 v 60:40 DM basis). These varying effects of NDF 
digestibility between Arndt et al. (2015) and Sinclair et al. (2015) may be 
attributable to the higher inclusion rate of 80% lucerne silage and lower NDF 
intake by 2.41 kg/day of lucerne silage in the study of Arndt et al. (2015).  
1.3.5 Milk production and composition 
A number of studies have examined the effects of different legume silages on milk 
yield and composition, and are summarised in Table 2. Broderick et al. (2001) 
reported that replacing lucerne silage with red clover silage alone did not affect 
milk yield; however there was an increase in yield when a mixture of red clover-
maize silage replaced lucerne silage. Cows fed diet containing red clover-maize 
silage (80:20 DM basis) also had an increase in milk protein yield, which averaged 
0.04 kg per day more than in cows fed the lucerne-maize silage (80:20 DM basis) 
(Broderick et al., 2001). It was, however, suggested that this increase may have 
been due to the addition of soyabean meal to the diet improving rumen degraded 
protein and rumen undegraded protein content. In contrast, in a study by Moorby 
et al. (2009) dairy cows fed red clover silage produced a higher milk yield than 
those fed grass silage which may be due to the increased DM intake. Milk fat 
content declined with increasing red clover, as milk yield increased (Moorby et al., 
2009). Moorby et al. (2009) concluded that milk fat was diluted in milk from cows 
fed this diet as there was no dietary treatment effect on milk fat yield. An important 
factor in milk fat content is body weight change of the cow, with an increase in milk 
fat content is associated with body weight loss (Broderick et al., 2000). The dairy 
cows in the study of Moorby et al. (2009) lost the greatest body weight of -0.25 kg 
per day when fed red clover silage, but was associated with the lowest milk fat 
content. In contrast, Broderick et al. (2000) reported that when dairy cows gained 
weight, there was a reduction in milk fat content. The deposition of fat into milk 
comes from four pathways in the body of a dairy cow, de novo synthesis in the 
mammary glands, uptake from the diet via blood, biohydrogenation in the rumen 
and the fat stores within the body (Stoop et al., 2009). Therefore, it could be 
suggested that cows will utilise the fat in the feed to improve body fat stores rather 
than improving the milk fat content.  
The reduction in milk protein content observed as the inclusion of red clover in the 
diet increased in the study of Moorby et al. (2009; Table 2) was suggested to be 
due to the grass silage having a high crude protein (CP) content of 206 g/kg DM 
compared to 194 g/kg DM for the red clover silage. Also, grass silage fed cows 
had a higher apparent efficiency of synthesis of milk protein than red clover fed 
cows. It was suggested that the amount of microbial protein reaching the small 
intestine was increased by grass silage causing a higher protein content in milk 
(Moorby et al., 2009). Grass silage has a higher water soluble carbohydrates but 
lower N content than the legume silages and the ratio of these two factors are 
important in the conversion of feed N to microbial N (Merry et al., 2006). It was 
shown by Merry et al. (2006) that the amount of microbial N from the rumen 
reaching the duodenum can be improved in dairy cows when both red clover and 
grass silage are included in the diet. Therefore, both these studies (Merry et al., 
2006 and Moorby et al., 2009) suggest that for a high protein content of over 30 
g/kg in milk, feeding a mixture of grass (33%) and red clover silage (66%) is better 
than feeding these silages individually to dairy cows. 
Previous studies (Adesogan et al., 2004; Salawu et al., 2002b) have investigated 
the use of bi-crops in dairy cows. Legume silages can be used as part of a bi-crop 
with several cereals such as barley and wheat (Adesogan et al., 2004). Wheat has 
a high degradability of starch within the rumen and legumes are thought to be able 
to complement wheat by improving milk performance of cows (Salawu et al., 
2002b).  Dairy cows fed a pea-wheat bi-crop in a study conducted by Salawu et al. 
(2002b) had milk yields which averaged 22.3 kg/d, improving milk yield by 1.57 
kg/d compared to those fed grass silage. There was however a reduction in milk 
fat content from 51.4 to 47.5 g/kg for cows fed the pea-wheat bi-crop Salawu et al. 
(2002b) which was suggested to be due to the lower DM intake. In a study 
conducted by Salawu et al. (2002b), growth stage of the crops at harvest may 
have been a contributing factor to milk fat content which was higher in all cows fed 
both pea crops that had been harvested after 13 weeks than cows that had 
received crops that had been harvested after 15 weeks. In contrast, Adesogan et 
al. (2004) reported no differences in milk yield or constituents when cows were fed 
pea-wheat bi-crop silage compared to grass silage. Comparing the bi-crops from 
both studies (Salawu et al., 2002b; Adesogan et al., 2004) DM digestibility was 95 
g/kg lower in the study of Salawu et al. (2002b) than in Aesogan et al. (2004). 
Aesogan et al. (2004) concluded that these factors may have contributed to the 
differences seen in milk fat content. Bi-crops, however, are difficult to compare 
with whole crops and whether effects seen in studies are due to the individual 
legume crop or not.

In more recent years, research has focussed on evaluating legumes, in particular 
peas, as a whole crop rather than as part of a bi-crop. In a study conducted by 
Sinclair et al. (2009), forage peas of either low (47.3 g/kg DM) or high (92.7 g/kg 
DM) condensed tannin content were included in the diet to investigate the effect 
on animal performance compared to a diet containing grass silage and whole crop 
wheat silage. It was reported that there was no change in milk yield or 
composition, and that both pea silages could replace soyabean meal at the rate of 
1.1 kg/day/cow in the diet. In contrast, in a study conducted by Mustafa et al. 
(2000), pea silage was compared to lucerne and barley silage with all diets being 
isonitrogenous. Forage type had no effect on milk yield, however there were some 
differences in milk composition; in cows fed lucerne silage, milk fat content was 
lower at 33.6 g/kg compared to 36.5 g/kg for both pea and barley silage. Milk 
protein content was higher at 31.6 g/kg for cows fed lucerne silage compared to 
30.3 g/kg for cows fed the pea silage. In the study conducted by Mustafa et al. 
(2000), the CP of the pea silage was lower at 170 g/kg DM and therefore may 
have contributed to the lower milk protein content. It was concluded by Mustafa et 
al. (2000) that lucerne and barley silage could be totally replaced by pea silage 
without affecting milk yield.  
1.3.6 Efficiency of nitrogen use 
Efficiency of nitrogen by lactating dairy cows is determined by the conversion of 
feed N to milk N, but in ruminants N efficiency is generally low varying between 15 
and 40 % (Calsamiglia et al., 2010). Nitrogen efficiency can indicate the flow of 
microbial protein from the rumen to the small intestine, relating to the nitrogen 
content of the feed with high efficiencies indicating a high flow rate (Moorby et al., 
2009). Efficiency of N can be impacted by the ensiling process due to the 
extensive breakdown of protein to NPN (Schulz et al., 2018). Red clover silage 
tends to produce a higher N efficiency when fed to dairy cows compared to grass 
silage, due to the less extensive proteolysis that occurs during the ensiling process 
and higher CP content in red clover silage (Schulz et al., 2018). Dewhurst et al. 
(2003) observed a lower N efficiency of 21% in cows fed red clover silage 
compared to 25.6% in cows fed grass silage however lucerne silage had a lower N 
efficiency of 18%. Lucerne silage tends to undergo extensive proteolysis therefore 
the availability of true protein is lower than grass or red clover silage. However, 
when N intake is considered, in the study by Dewhurst et al. (2003), cows fed 
lucerne silage had the highest intake at 778 g/day whilst cows fed grass silage had 
the lowest N intake at 507 g/day. Dewhurst et al. (2003) suggested the low N 
efficiency but high N intake of lucerne silage may be due to an imbalance of 
indigestible fibre and rapidly available N. In a study conducted by Arndt et al. 
(2015), it was observed that as the amount of lucerne silage in the diet increased 
from 20 to 80%, N efficiency decreased from 30.7 to 24.1 g/100g, respectively. 
Although, there was a linear increase in N intake, fecal N and urinary N, therefore 
Arndt et al. (2015) suggested that these changes in N efficiency may be due to the 
reduced CP available and higher losses of N in urine and faeces.  
Similarly, Broderick et al. (2001) observed a higher N efficiency of 0.250 kg milk 
N/kg feed N when dairy cows were offered red clover silage compared to an N 
efficiency of 0.233 kg milk N/kg feed N for cows fed lucerne silage. These 
differences in N efficiency between red clover and lucerne silage may be due to 
the lower NPN content that is found in red clover silage following proteolysis in the 
silo (Schulz et al., 2018). It is noted that the CP content of the lucerne silage was 
higher at 191 g/kg DM compared to 179 g/kg DM for the red clover silage in 
Broderick  et al. (2001) study, however due to the extensive proteolysis occurring 
within in the silo, the CP content in the lucerne silage may be higher in RDP 
increasing N losses in the urine and faeces. Therefore, the higher N efficiency in 
cows fed red clover silage may be due to higher levels of RUP which becomes 
available for digestion in the small intestine and conversion to milk N. In a study 
conducted by Vanhatalo et al. (2009), cows fed grass silage had an N efficiency 
that was 6% higher at 29% than cows fed red clover silage. Nitrogen efficiency of 
grass silage used in Dewhurst et al. (2003) and Vanhatalo et al. (2009) studies 
differed by 3.4%, and it was higher in Vanhatalo et al. (2009) study, which could 
be attributable to the difference in CP content of the grass silages. In Vanhatalo et 
al. (2009) study, the grass silage was 46.5 g/kg DM lower in CP content than 
Dewhurst et al. (2003) which would suggest that there were higher urinary and 
faecal N losses in the Dewhurst et al. (2003) study. Therefore, crude protein of 
silage plays an important role in the conversion of feed N to milk N and N 
efficiency.  
Nitrogen efficiency was not improved by the inclusion of pea silage when Salawu 
et al. (2002b) fed a pea-wheat intercrop to dairy cows, with N efficiency averaging 
21.6% which was 2.4% lower than in cows fed grass silage. In comparison, 
Sinclair et al. (2009) fed whole crop pea silage and reported that cows fed grass 
silage had an N efficiency of 0.295 g/g which was higher than the 0.241 g/g 
observed in cows fed whole crop pea silage. Nitrogen efficiency can be effected by 
different factors including milk yield and change in body weight therefore when 
comparing results from studies care must be taken (Sinclair et al., 2009). High 
levels of RUP in the feed can impact the N efficiency of forages because microbes 
will breakdown higher proportions of RDP to ammonia losses across the rumen 
wall, therefore the MP supply for the dairy cow is met by the supply of RUP in the 
feed (Lee, 2014). Therefore, the conversion of feed N to milk N is increased 
resulting in improved N efficiency (Lee, 2014). 
1.4 Tannins 
Tannins can be classified as either condensed or hydrolysable (Scalbert, 1991). 
Condensed tannins have a higher molecular weight of up to 20 000 g/mol 
compared to hydrolysable tannins that have a molecular weight varying between 
500 to 3000 g/mol (Cieslak et al., 2013). Condensed and hydrolysable tannins are 
extracted from different plants. For example, tropical plants produce more 
condensed tannins such as quebracho (Schinopsis marginata) and mimosa 
(Acacia mearnsii), while temperate plants produce more hydrolysable tannins such 
as chestnut (Castanea sativa L.) tannins (Tabacco et al., 2006). In plant cells 
tannins can be found in various areas. For instance vacuoles can contain large 
quantities of tannins while in the epidermis and trichomes of leaves, tannins are 
more concentrated (Aerts et al., 1999).  
1.4.1 Condensed tannins 
Condensed tannins are heterogenous compounds that are also known as 
proanthyocyanides (Waghorn, 2008). Condensed tannins are secondary plant 
metabolites containing polyhydroxy-flavan-3-ol oligomers and polymers (McMahon 
et al., 2000) as seen in Figure 3. Carbon-carbon bonds occur between flavanol 
subunits, linking oligomers and polymers (Schofield et al., 2001). These carbon 
bonds are stable during hydrolysis (Reed, 1995). Chain lengths of flavanol units in 
polymers of condensed tannins that occur in temperate forages can vary from two 
to over twenty (Waghorn, 2008).  
Figure 3 Chemical structure of condensed tannin containing three flavanol-3-ol 
subunits.  After McMahon et al. (2000). 
The palatability of a plant containing condensed tannins can be affected by the 
growth stage, due to tannins varying in concentration with age of the plant 
(McMahon et al., 2000). Condensed tannins can form complexes with proteins, 
fatty acids and minerals in certain conditions depending on pH, and in ruminants 
this binding of protein occurs in the rumen at pH 4.5  7.0, with normal rumen pH 
being 6.5  7.0 (McMahon et al., 2000). The protein complexes are stable within 
the rumen and will pass freely through to the abomasum and small intestine where 
dissociation occurs (Tabacco et al., 2006). In some cases, if the protein is 
covalently bound to the condensed tannin, this complex may not separate and will 
pass out in the faeces (McMahon et al., 2000).    
1.4.2 Hydrolysable tannins 
Hydrolysable tannins, can be classified as two esters of core molecules, either 
gallic acid or ellagic acid (Figure 4; McMahon et al., 2000). Gallic acid and ellagic 
acid are formed during hydrolysis of gallotannins and ellagitannins respectively, 
with glucose also being a product in both cases (Mueller-Harvey, 2001). In water, 
hydrolysable tannins are more soluble than condensed tannins (Reed, 1995). In 
acids and bases, hydrolysable tannins are very soluble, with certain enzymes 
causing the same effect (Kumar and Vaithiyanathan, 1990). For both gallotannins 
and ellagitannins, the precursor for these structures is pentagalloylglucose 
(Mueller-Harvey, 2001).  The main structure of gallotannins consists of gallic acid 
units that surround a polyol compound like glucose. A depside bond occurs in the 
structure between two gallic acid units (Mueller-Harvey, 2001). This bond occurs 
between the acid group of the gallic acid unit joining and the phenolic group of the 
gallic acid unit of the gallotannin (Mueller-Harvey, 2001). In ellagitannins, oxidative 
reactions occur between the gallic acid units to form large and complex tannins 
(Mueller-Harvey, 2001). Ellagitannins have intramolecular biphenyl linkages that 
cause hydrolysable tannins to be unyielding structurally, whereas gallotannins lack 
these linkages and are therefore more adaptable (Deaville et al., 2007). Unlike, 
condensed tannins that are not degraded by microbes in the rumen, hydrolysable 
tannins can be attacked by certain microbes (Makkar, 2003). The phenolic 
hydroxyl groups within hydrolysable tannins can also be methylated by certain 
rumen microbes causing a reduction in the tannins protein binding activity 
(Makkar, 2003).  
Figure 4 Chemical structure of hydrolysable tannin. After McSweeney et al. (2001). 
1.4.3 Effects of tannins on ensiling 
The effects of both condensed and hydrolysable tannins have been studied to 
observe their effects on ensiling, intake, rumen fermentation, animal performance 
and digestion. The ability of tannins to bind with protein can provide protection 
from proteolysis in the silo and microbial attack in the rumen therefore improving 
the flow of non-ammonia nitrogen to the small intestine (Ahnert et al., 2015). 
Protein degradation during the ensiling process has been shown to be reduced 
when condensed tannins were added to grass silage as seen by the increase in 
total N from 25.9 to 26.7 g/kg DM when condensed tannins are included at a rate 
of 0 to 50 g/kg DM, respectively (Salawu et al., 1999; Table 3). In a similar study, 
hydrolysable tannins were added to lucerne silage at four different rates 0, 20, 40 
and 60 g/kg DM at ensiling (Tabacco et al., 2006; Table 3). Following a 120 day 
conservation period, Tabacco et al. (2006) observed a reduction in non-protein 
nitrogen (NPN) content of the silage from 75.9 to 64.6 % total N as inclusion rate 
increased from 0 to 60 g/kg DM hydrolysable tannin. Similarly, in a study 
conducted by Deaville et al. (2010) the addition of hydrolysable tannin at 74.3 g/kg 
DM to grass silage had a higher total N content of 22.5 g/kg DM compared to 20.9 
g/kg DM when condensed tannin was added to grass silage at a rate of 76.1 g/kg 
DM. Therefore, it can be concluded that the addition of condensed or hydrolysable 
tannins at ensiling can reduce the proteolysis of protein in silage during the 
conservation period.

1.4.4 Effects of tannins on intake 
The addition of tannins to ruminants diets have had a varying effect on DM intake 
of cows and sheep. Dschaak et al. (2011) observed a decline of 1.8 kg/d in DM 
intake in dairy cows when lucerne hay was supplemented with 30 g/kg DM of 
condensed tannins (Table 4). Similarly, Aguerre et al. (2016) observed a linear 
decline in DM intake from 25.5 to 23.4 kg/d in cows fed lucerne silage 
supplemented with a mixture of condensed and hydrolysable tannin (CT:HT = 
33:66) at inclusion rates 0, 4.5, 9.0 and 18 g/kg DM. In contrast, Deaville et al. 
(2010) observed an improved DM intake of 109 g/day when condensed tannins 
replaced hydrolysable tannins at 75 g/kg DM to grass silage when fed to wether 
sheep. However, when the condensed tannins were added at feeding there was 
an increase in DM intake of 69 g/day compared to when the same tannins were 
added at ensiling (Deaville et al., 2010). There was no effect of tannin addition 
method on the DM intake for grass silage with hydrolysable tannins therefore 
suggesting that hydrolysable tannins can be added at ensiling or feed out without 
affecting DM intake (Deaville et al., 2010). Gerlach et al. (2018) reported no 
change in DM intake of dairy cows when condensed tannin was included at feed 
out in a grass and maize silage based diet at inclusion rates of 10 and 30 g/kg DM. 
Tannins have been associated with influencing the palatability of silages fed to 
ruminants however the inconsistency of DM intakes when varying levels of tannins 
have been fed make it difficult to draw a conclusion.  
1.4.5 Effects of tannins on rumen pH 
Previous studies have shown no effect of tannins on ruminal pH (Table 4), 
although studies have shown differing effects on rumen volatile fatty acid 
concentration. Augerre et al. (2016) reported no change in rumen pH when dairy 
cows were fed an increasing rate of a mix of condensed and hydrolysable tannins 
(ratio = 33:66, respectively), with rumen pH averaging pH 6.43 across the four 
inclusion rates of 0, 4.5, 9.0 and 18 g/kg DM. Similarly, Dschaak et al. (2011) 
observed no effect on rumen pH when dairy cows were fed lucerne hay 
supplemented with condensed tannins, with pH averaging pH 6.38 and pH 6.41 for 
no tannin and added tannins, respectively. Benchaar et al. (2008) also reported no 
effect of supplementation of condensed tannins at 150 g/d at feed out in a grass 
and maize silage based TMR fed to dairy cows on rumen pH which was pH 6.68 
and pH 6.66 for control and tannins added, respectively. Considering the variation 
in levels of tannin supplemented to the diet and different species, rumen pH has 
remained unaffected in previous studies suggesting tannins can be included in the 
diet of a ruminant without any effect on the pH of the rumen.  
1.4.6 Effects of tannins on rumen VFAs 
Rumen volatile fatty acid concentrations, however, have been affected in some, 
but not all previous studies, for example, Benchaar et al. (2008) reported no effect 
of condensed (quebracho) tannins on total VFA concentration or individual VFA 
concentration. Similarly, Augerre et al. (2016) observed no changes in total VFA 
concentration or acetate, propionate and butyrate concentrations when a mix of 
hydrolysable (chestnut) and condensed (quebracho) tannins were included in the 
diet of dairy cows. In contrast, Dschaak et al. (2011) observed a decline in total 
VFA concentration but this was coupled with a decline in DM intake when 
condensed (quebracho) tannins were included in the diet. Interestingly, condensed 
tannins added to the diet containing a higher forage content (59:41 
forage:concentrate; DM basis) increased concentrations of acetate, propionate 
and butyrate by 1.6, 1.6 and 1.0 mol/100 mol, respectively. However, in the diet 
containing a lower forage content (41:59 forage:concentrate; DM basis), 
condensed tannins had no effect on acetate, propionate or butyrate concentration 
which averaged 58.4, 25.0 or 13.3 mol/100 mol, respectively (Dschaak et al., 
2011). Dschaak et al. (2011) concluded that lucerne hay supplemented with 
condensed tannins fed at a high forage to concentrate ratio could influence rumen 
fermentation. Although, these inconsistencies in rumen fermentation could be 
linked to the different species of condensed and hydrolysable tannins or inclusion 
rates of the tannins or the interaction between the tannin and diet, it is difficult to 
draw a conclusion on the effects of tannin on rumen fermentation.

1.4.7 Effects of tannins on animal performance and digestion 
Variations in the effects of added tannins on animal performance may be 
influenced by the different inclusion rates and species of tannins used in the 
different studies (Table 4). Augerre et al. (2016) and Dschaak et al. (2011) both 
reported no change in milk yield when dairy cows were offered condensed or 
hydrolysable tannins. Milk composition was also not changed by the inclusion of 
tannin in the diet in the study of Dschaak et al. (2011). However, Augerre et al. 
(2016) reported that milk fat and lactose content remained unchanged but milk 
protein yield declined linearly from 1.20 to 1.15 kg/d as tannin level increased from 
0 to 18 g/kg DM, respectively. Liu et al. (2013), observed no changes in milk fat, 
protein or lactose content of milk from dairy cows fed a diet supplemented with 10 
g/kg DM of hydrolysable tannins from 3 weeks pre-calving to 3 weeks post-calving. 
Similar to Augerre et al. (2016); Gerlach et al. (2018) observed no effect of 
condensed tannins on milk yield or fat content but reported a decline in milk 
protein yield and N efficiency in the 3rd period of the study when diets were 
supplemented with 30 g/kg DM condensed tannins. Gerlach et al. (2018) 
concluded that even though tannins dissociate from proteins in the small intestine, 
not all the protein will be digested. Therefore, the decline in milk protein yield may 
be due to a reduced absorption of amino acids in the small intestine thus reducing 
the supply of amino acids available for protein synthesis in the mammary gland.  
Whole tract digestibility of DM, OM, CP and NDF were not affected by the 
inclusion of condensed tannins in a diet containing lucerne hay (Dschaak et al., 
2011). In contrast, Gerlach et al. (2018) observed a decline in OM digestibility in 
dairy cows fed a diet containing 30 g/kg of condensed tannins. Likewise, Augerre 
et al. (2016) reported a linear decline in DM, OM, CP and NDF digestibility as the 
inclusion rate of a mixture of hydrolysable and condensed tannin increased in the 
diet. Crude protein digestibility had the greatest reduction (Augerre et al., 2016) 
which was to be expected due to the strong bond tannins have with protein 
compared to other components of the feed (Gerlach et al., 2018). The rate of 
clearance of digested feed from the rumen affects whole tract digestibility, and the 
decline in NDF digestibility would suggest a slow clearance of fibre which would 
explain the decline in DM intake in the study of Augerre et al. (2016). Similarly, 
Deaville et al. (2010) reported that the addition of hydrolysable or condensed 
tannin reduced DM and OM digestibility in comparison to the untreated grass 
silage. The addition of condensed tannin produced the largest decline in DM and 
OM digestibility, Deaville et al. (2010) suggested that the condensed tannins were 
binding with the plant cell wall components forming protein complexes thereby 
reducing microbial degradation of the plant in the rumen. The results from previous 
studies on the effects of both condensed and hydrolysable tannins on ensiling, 
intake, rumen fermentation, animal performance and digestion have been 
inconsistent therefore it is difficult to draw a conclusion about whether the inclusion 
of tannins in a ruminants diet is beneficial in reducing protein degradability in the 
rumen whilst improving RUP and MP supply to the dairy cow. 
1.4.8 Effects of tannins on milk fatty acid profile 
Milk fat is a triglyceride composed of one glycerol molecule and three fatty acids. 
Fatty acids are long chains of carbon atoms containing a carboxyl acid group at 
the end. Fatty acids (FAs) can be saturated or unsaturated depending on the type 
of bonds within the chain, saturated FAs contain only single bonds between 
carbon atoms whereas in unsaturated fatty acids contain a mixture of single and 
double bonds between carbon atoms (McDonald et al., 2011). The number of 
carbon atoms in the FA chain determines the length and type of FA, long chain 
FAs have more than 12 carbon atoms, medium chain FAs have between 8 to 12 
carbon atoms whilst short chain FAs have less than 8 carbon atoms (McDonald et 
al., 2011). Milk fatty acids are derived in two main ways, either by de novo 
synthesis in the mammary gland or uptake from the diet in the blood (Mansbridge 
and Blake, 1997). Further to these two pathways, milk FAs can also be derived 
from biohydrogenation in the rumen and body stores of fat (Stoop et al., 2009). In 
milk, FAs of chain length less than C16 tend to be produced by de novo synthesis, 
whilst FAs of chain length more than C16 tend to be taken up from the diet 
(Mansbridge and Blake, 1997).   
In milk fat, saturated FAs are the main constituent accounting for up to 75 g/100g 
of the total fatty acids. The polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content of milk is 4 
g/100g with linoleic (C18:2 n-6) and -linolenic (C18:3 n-3) being the main FAs 
present (Mansbridge and Blake, 1997). PUFAs are typically found in high 
concentrations in grass, however occur in low concentrations in milk or meat 
products of ruminants fed grass or grass silage (Jenkins et al., 2008). In the 
rumen, lipids will undergo lipolysis by microbes which releases the fatty acids from 
the glycerol molecule (Jenkins et al., 2008). Following lipolysis, these free PUFAs 
will undergo biohydrogenation which is the transformation of PUFAs to saturated 
FAs, both linoleic and -linolenic acids are converted to C18:0 during this process 
(Jenkins et al., 2008; Figure 5). Diet and nutrition of a ruminant can alter the 
microbial population within the rumen, altering lipolysis and biohydrogenation of 
dietary lipids, causing a change in both composition and fat content of the milk 
(Bauman and Griinari, 2003). Therefore, there is potential for the diet of ruminants 
to be altered to improve the concentrations of PUFAs in the milk by providing 
protection of the PUFAs from biohydrogenation or changing the biohydrogenation 
pathway.

Hazlewood, (1988). 
The addition of tannins to the diet of dairy cows has had varying effects on the milk 
fatty acid profile. A previous study by Benchaar and Chouinard, (2009) observed 
no change in individual milk fatty acid concentrations of lactating dairy cows when 
150 g/d condensed tannin was added to grass silage based TMR. In a study 
conducted by Turner et al. (2005), dairy cows grazed either a ryegrass-based 
pasture or birdsfoot trefoil which contains naturally occurring condensed tannins, 
although the study did not measure the tannin content. It was observed that there 
was a decrease in the saturated fatty acid C18:0 concentration in milk of cows fed 
birdsfoot trefoil. Concentrations of linoleic (C18:2 n-6) and -linolenic (C18:3 n-3) 
acids were higher, along with concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids being 
significantly higher in milk from cows fed birdsfoot trefoil compared to cows fed 
ryegrass pasture. Therefore, Turner et al. (2005) concluded that the condensed 
tannins present in birdsfoot trefoil altered the biohydrogenation occurring in the 
rumen therefore affecting the milk fatty acid profile. Similarly, Dschaak et al. (2011) 
observed minor effects of the addition of 30 g/kg DM condensed tannin to a 
lucerne hay and maize silage based TMR on milk fatty acid profile of dairy cows. 
Although, the addition of condensed tannin did increase the concentrations of -
linolenic (C18:3 n-3) acid and C20:1 by 0.04 g/100g in dairy cows. Dschaak et al. 
(2011) suggested these changes in these fatty acids were caused by the tannins 
hindering the microbes in the rumen therefore changing the biohydrogenation 
pathways. The effect of condensed tannins at a rate of 79 g/kg DM on 
biohydrogenation in the rumen has been studied in continuous cultures in vitro by 
Khiaosa-Ard et al. (2009) who observed an accumulation of C18:1 trans-11 due to 
the condensed tannins preventing the final step of the biohydrogenation pathway. 
Therefore, it can be concluded that the presence of tannins in the diet of lactating 
dairy cows have the potential to alter the biohydrogenation pathway thereby 
influencing the milk fatty acid profile.  
1.5  Degradability of proteins in the rumen 
Protein available in forages and concentrates can be classified as two types of 
protein, rumen degradable protein (RDP) and rumen undegradable protein (RUP) 
(Bach et al., 2005). Rumen degradable protein is composed of two components; 
true protein and non-protein nitrogen (NPN) (Bach et al., 2005). The amount of 
RDP and RUP available from forages or concentrates is variable (Broderick, 
1995). The digestion of RDP and RUP in the ruminant is shown in Figure 6.  
Rumen degradable protein will undergo degradation in the rumen by microbes, 
producing microbial protein and ammonia (Reynal and Broderick, 2005). 
Approximately 50% of protein reaching the small intestine will be made up from 
microbial protein in a high yielding dairy cow (Schwab and Broderick, 2017). 
Microbial protein synthesis is dependent on the amount of energy and protein 
available from the feed as energy is required for growth of the microbes (Clark et 
al., 1992). Bacteria form an attachment with protein in the feed and the activity of 
these microorganisms degrade protein to peptides, amino acids and ammonia-
nitrogen (Bach et al., 2005). For successful degradation of protein, many different 
species of bacteria will ferment the protein due to the large number of bonds (Bach 
et al., 2005). The type of protein and action of microbes play an important role in 
the degree of degradation; when this is rapid, large quantities of protein will be 
degraded however rumen microbes are often unable to fully utilise the available 
amino acids and ammonia (Broderick., 1995; Bach et al., 2005). Although, the 
degree of degradation will depend on the availability of fermentable metabolisable 
energy and the balance between RDP and RUP in the diet (Bach et al., 2005). 
Therefore, a loss of ammonia occurs, resulting in it being absorbed across the 
rumen epithelium into the blood to be transported to the liver (Broderick., 1995; 
Bach et al., 2005). In the liver, ammonia is converted into urea prior to being 
excreted via urine (Broderick and Albrecht., 1997). Urea can be transported back 
to the rumen to provide a nitrogen source for microbes when RDP levels are low 
(Lapierre and Lobley, 2001). Recycling of urea to the rumen can also have the 
potential to improve N efficiency and lower the excretion of N, therefore reducing 
the amount of N being released into the environment (Mutsvangwa et al., 2016). 
Mutsvangwa et al. (2016) investigated the effects of reducing dietary CP (149 vs. 
175 g/kg DM) and RDP (63 vs 69% of CP) fed to dairy cows on urea-N recycling. It 
was reported that urea-N entry rate into the rumen increased when dietary CP and 
RDP were reduced as there were lower concentrations of ammonia in the rumen 
therefore microbial protein supply remained constant. Lower excretions of N in 
urine were also observed due to the recycling of urea-N, therefore improving N 
efficiency (Mutsvangwa et al., 2016).  
Figure 6 The digestion of protein within a ruminant. Adapted from McDonald et al. 
(2011).  
Protein that escapes microbial degradation in the rumen, rumen undegradable 
protein (RUP), and passes through the rumen to the abomasum prior to digestion 
and absorption in the small intestine (Allison and Garnsworthy, 2002). 
Metabolisable protein (MP) is a combination of RUP and microbial protein that has 
become available in the small intestine following digestion in the rumen (Van 
Emon et al., 2014). In the small intestine, RUP undergoes digestion by enzymes to 
release amino acids that are available for absorption (Bohnert et al., 2002). Amino 
acids and peptides are absorbed across the small intestinal wall; excess amino 
acids will be converted to urea in the liver and excreted in the urine (Bohnert et al., 
2002). The availability of individual amino acids from MP determines whether the 
ruminant can utilise them; microbial protein will supply the majority of amino acids 
however methionine, lysine, and histidine can be lacking in RUP depending on the 
feed source (Johansen et al., 2018). Milk production can be compromised when 
these amino acids are limited or lacking even if MP supply is optimal (Johansen et 
al., 2018). Therefore, amino acids from RUP should harmonise with the microbial 
protein supply of amino acids (Korhonen et al., 2002). Soybean meal (SBM) is a 
source of RUP which is used in the dairy industry, and can supply a respectable 
amount of histidine and lysine however methionine levels are low (Korhonen et al., 
2002). However, microbial protein supply can provide methionine therefore SBM 
and microbial protein can provide the essential amino acids that are required 
during milk production (Korhonen et al., 2002).  
Dairy cows in early or peak lactation have the highest requirement for RUP as 
microbial protein supply alone is unable to meet the cows MP requirement 
(Dunlap et al., 2000). Microbial protein can met the MP requirements of lower 
yielding dairy cows but microbial protein supply cannot provide all the MP a dairy 
cow producing 50 kg/d of milk requires, and therefore there must be an adequate 
supply of by-pass (RUP) protein to meet the cows MP requirement (Dunlap et al., 
2000). 
1.5.1 Measurement of dietary RDP and RUP 
Ruminal degradability of protein can be measured using the in situ technique and 
many studies have studied protein degradability in forage legumes using this 
technique. The in situ technique provides degradation parameters including the 
soluble fraction, the potential rumen degradable fraction, and the rate of 
degradation (Figure 7; rskov and McDonald., 1979). In a study conducted by 
Mustafa et al., (2000) pea, barley and lucerne silage was compared for protein 
degradability. All three silages had a soluble CP fraction that was above 69.2 % of 
CP with pea and lucerne silage being highest at 78.5 % of CP. In contrast to the 
high soluble fraction, the slowly degradable CP fraction was below 20 % for all 
three silages, with pea and barley silage being the lowest at 15.4 %. The rate of 
degradation is related to the slowly degradable fraction, and Mustafa et al. (2000) 
concluded that the high ruminal CP degradability was influenced by the fast rate of 
degradation observed in pea silages.  
Figure 7 The degradation curve of protein in the rumen over 72 hours. Where a = 
soluble fraction, b = potential rumen degradable fraction and c = rate of 
degradation. Adapted from Chamberlain and Wilkinson, (1996). 
In a later study, Mustafa et al. (2002) compared the rumen degradability three 
varieties of pea silage, Lenca, Carneval and Delta. Delta pea silage had the 
highest soluble fraction at 82.8 % whilst Lenca pea silage was 13.7 % lower. The 
slowly degradable CP fraction varied between the three pea silages, however the 
rate at which the slowly degradable CP fraction was degraded was similar and 
rapid averaging 11.8 %/h. Therefore, ruminal degradability was high for the three 
pea silages, results were similar to Mustafa et al. (2000). Differences in rumen 
degradable CP between pea silages is influenced by the CP content of the silage 
and Mustafa et al. (2002), reported that Carneval had the highest CP content of 
205 g/kg DM and Lenca the lowest at 179 g/kg DM. In a study conducted by Merry 
et al. (2006), ruminal degradability of N was 9.5 % higher in grass silage compared 
to red clover silage. Merry et al. (2006) suggested the lower N degradability in red 
clover silage was due to the activity of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) enzyme by 
binding to the protein thereby reducing degradability in the rumen.  
1.6 Forage peas 
Forage peas (Pisum sativum) are forage legumes that have previously been 
grown in the UK only for seed production but more recently have been ensiled for 
winter feed for dairy cows (Fraser et al., 2001). Spring sown forage peas have a 
short growing season of between 12 and 18 weeks with a high DM yield and 
protein content, and have the ability to fix nitrogen therefore requiring no nitrogen 
fertilisers (Fraser et al., 2001).  
1.6.1 Growth and establishment 
Forage peas require free-draining, sandy soils with a pH between 6 and 7 for 
successful plant growth (Frame, 2005). In the UK, seeds are most often sown in 
the spring when soil temperatures have reached between 7 and 8C, and are 
drilled at a depth of between 3 and 5 cm. Seed rate is dependent on seed size and 
whether the crop will be whole crop or as part of a bi-crop (Frame, 2005; Knott, 
1987). In studies examining forage peas as part of a bi-crop, seed rate varied 
between 117  188 kg per hectare (Adesogan et al., 2004) and 134  230 kg per 
hectare (Salawu et al., 2002b; Adesogan et al., 2002). When seeds are sown for a 
whole crop, seed rate varied between 127  245 kg per hectare (Fraser et al., 
2001; Sinclair et al., 2009; Mustafa et al., 2002).  
The growth of forage peas can be described in four stages; germination and 
emergence, vegetative, reproductive and senescence stages which are 
summarised in Table 5. During the first stages of germination, the seed swells as 
water is taken up, a tap root will then begin to grow and can grow to depths of over 
1 m (Knott, 1987 and Frame, 2005). At the same time, a shoot will begin to 
emerge and will form the main stem of the plant (Knott, 1987). The vegetative 
stage involves the growth of nodes on the main stem, with the number of nodes 
varying between species; leaves will develop and unfold on each node (Knott, 
1987).

Adapted from Knott, (1987) 
During the reproductive stage, flower buds begin to develop on the stems and 
eventually the flowers will open. Flower colour varies between species with either 
pink, purple or white flowers (Knott, 1987). In forage peas, condensed tannins 
occur naturally with flower colour indicating the level of tannin present, with white 
flowers indicating low levels while coloured flowers indicate high levels (Wang et 
al., 1998). Hart et al. (2011) and Sinclair et al. (2009) reported condensed tannin 
levels of 47.3 and 92.7 g/kg DM for white and coloured forage pea silage, 
respectively. Once flowers open, pods begin to develop with small seeds and as 
the pods fill out, the seeds become green in colour (Knott, 1987). Gradually the 
pods become wrinkled and change colour from green to yellow, and eventually the 
pods and seeds dry out, again changing colour to brown (Knott, 1987). The 
senescence stage describes the changes in pod colour across the whole plant 
(Table 5).  
1.6.2 Harvesting, ensiling and nutritive value 
A number of studies have examined the effects of wilting and ensiling on the 
nutritive value of forage peas; and are summarised in Table 6. In forage pea 
silage, there are a number of factors that can affect overall quality of the silage, 
including plant maturity, wilting, drop in pH and protein degradation (Cavallarin et 
al., 2006). In a study conducted by Fraser et al. (2001), forage pea silage was 
harvested on three dates, 10, 12 and 14 weeks post sowing which represented 
growth stages 204, 205 and 207, respectively (Knott., 1987). At harvest, DM 
content was similar for weeks 10 and 12 averaging 153 g/kg whereas by week 14 
DM content had risen to 206 g/kg. However, following 24 hours of wilting, Fraser et 
al. (2001) observed a similar DM content of 331 g/kg for the three different harvest 
dates. After 24 hours wilting and 90 days of ensiling, crude protein content was 45 
and 27 g/kg DM higher in silage harvested at 10 weeks post sowing, respectively, 
compared to 12 and 14 weeks. Pea silage had the highest DM yield of 6172 kg/ha 
when harvest occurred 12 weeks post sowing compared to yields of 5593 and 
5596 kg/ha for harvest occurring 10 and 14 weeks post sowing, respectively 
(Fraser et al., 2001). Fraser et al. (2001) concluded that forage peas should be 
harvested at growth stage 205, which corresponds to 12 weeks post sowing, to 
achieve good DM yields and nutritive value of the ensiled forage. 
In a study conducted by Mustafa et al. (2002) the fermentation profile of three pea 
silages; Lenca, Carneval and Delta, were compared over the ensiling process at 0, 
2, 4, 8, 16 and 70 days. A drop in pH to below 4 was observed during the first 
eight days of fermentation with a rapid drop in the first two days to pH 4.5 (Mustafa 
et al., 2002). In all three pea silages, from day 8 to 70, pH continued to remain 
below pH 4 indicating good preservation of the silages. Similarly, Mustafa and 
Seguin, (2003) observed a drop in pH to below pH 4 in the first 8 days followed by 
a steady decline to 45 days post ensiling. The rapid drop in pH to below 4 in pea 
silage during the first two days post ensiling is essential for preservation of the 
crop, and Mustafa and Seguin, (2003) observed lactic acid concentration rising 
from day 0 to day 16 before stabilising until the silos were opened on day 45. 
These observations of pH and lactic acid concentration show that forage peas can 
be ensiled and preserved to the same quality as grass and other forage legumes.

In several studies, research has focussed on feeding pea silage as part of a bi-
crop with a cereal forage (Adesogan et al., 2004; Salawu et al., 2001). Salawu et 
al. (2001) investigated the effects of growth stage at harvest, inclusion rate of pea 
in the crop and variety of pea (magnus and setchey) on chemical composition of 
the silage. Silages were harvested over a range of growth stages from 103 to 209 
which represented weeks 7 to 15 post sowing, over a period of two years. In both 
years and varieties, DM content at harvest increased from 125 to 333 g/kg over 
weeks 7 to 15 post sowing, respectively. When inclusion rate of pea silage to 
wheat was 3:1 and the silage was harvested at 15 weeks post sowing, crude 
protein content was 14 g/kg DM higher than silage sown with a ratio of 2:1 
pea:wheat and harvested at 13 weeks post sowing. Salawu et al. (2001) 
concluded that when pea silage was intercropped with wheat, the optimum growth 
stage to harvest was 209 when the pods were yellow and wrinkled, while a higher 
pea inclusion rate improved the crude protein content of the bi-crop due to the high 
protein content of peas.  
1.6.3 Milk performance 
Adesogan et al. (2004) examined the performance of dairy cows fed a pea-wheat 
silage with Magnus and Setchy pea varieties sown with wheat at a ratio of 4:1, and 
harvested 14 weeks post sowing and wilted (Table 6). A grass silage (with either 4 
or 8 kg/d concentrate) diet was used as the control, whilst pea-wheat silages were 
fed ad libitum with 4 kg/d concentrate. Adesogan et al. (2004) observed cows fed 
pea-wheat silages had forage DM intakes that were 3.5 kg/d more than cows fed 
grass silage. Milk yields were also 3.2 kg/d higher in cows fed setchy pea-wheat 
silage while being similar to grass silage when fed with 8 kg/d of concentrate, 
averaging 24.2 kg/d.  
Salawu et al. (2002b) investigated different inclusion rates of pea silage in an 
intercrop with wheat in dairy cows, with Magnus peas sown with wheat to establish 
inclusion rates of 75:25 and 25:75 (pea:wheat). Both silages were harvested at 13 
and 15 weeks post sowing at growth stages 206 (full pod) and 209 (yellow 
wrinkled pods), respectively, and grass silage was used as a control, with all 
silages fed with 6 kg/d of concentrate, and a second grass silage diet with 9 kg/d 
concentrate. Salawu et al. (2002b) observed higher forage DM intakes in cows fed 
pea-wheat silages averaging 10.6, 11.1 and 8.7 kg/d for high pea-wheat, 
low pea-wheat and grass silage, respectively. However, total DM intakes were 
similar between the pea-wheat silages and grass silage when fed with 9 kg/d 
concentrate, averaging 16.0 and 16.3 kg per day, respectively. Salawu et al. 
(2002b) reported that cows fed pea-wheat silage spent 249 minutes per day at the 
feeders whereas cows fed grass silage spent 211 minutes per day. Similarly, the 
number of meals eaten by cows fed pea-wheat silages was higher than cows fed 
grass silage averaging 13.3 and 9.4 meals per day, respectively. From these two 
studies, it can be concluded that bi-crops containing pea silage can improve DM 
intake and milk yield of dairy cows compared to grass silage, or replace 
concentrates and result in a similar performance. 
Table 7 summarises a number of studies that have examined the effect of pea 
silage as a bi-crop and a whole crop; all silages were harvested at either growth 
stage 206 (full pod) or 209 (yellow wrinkled pods). Sinclair et al. (2009) examined 
performance of dairy cows fed whole crop pea silage harvested at growth stage 
206 and inclusion rates of 50 % forage DM. Dry matter intake of pea silage in the 
study of Sinclair et al. (2009) was 1.5 kg/d more than cows fed grass silage. Milk 
yields observed in Sinclair et al. (2009) were similar in cows fed pea or grass 
silage. From previous studies, pea silage has maintained DM intakes and milk 
yield as either a bi-crop or whole crop silage therefore pea silage, can replace 
grass silage in a lactating dairy cow diet.

1.7 Red clover and lucerne 
Red clover (Trifolium pratense) and lucerne (Medicago sativa) are forage legumes 
that are grown in the temperate regions of Europe and United States (Moorby et 
al., 2016). As legumes, red clover and lucerne have the ability to fix nitrogen, 
therefore during growth and establishment stages there is no requirement for 
nitrogen fertilisers (Moorby et al., 2016). Both red clover and lucerne are perennial 
legumes that can be harvested between two and three times per year (Frame et 
al., 1998).  
1.7.1 Growth and establishment 
In a broad range of soil types except acidic, wet or shallow soils, red clover 
develops and establishes well whereas lucerne prefers well drained and deep soils 
due to having a tap root requiring depths of between 2 and 4 metres (Frame and 
Laidlaw, 2011; Frame et al., 1998). Red clover and lucerne require a soil pH of 
between 6.0 and 6.5 for successful plant growth, however red clover can be grown 
in soils with a lower pH of 5.0 to 6.0 (Frame, 2005). Seeds of forage legumes are 
small in size and therefore require sowing at a shallow depth to ensure 
germination can occur quickly as the seed has a small food reserve (Frame, 
2005). Seeds for lucerne and red clover are best direct drilled at depths of less 
than 20 mm and 15 mm, respectively (Frame et al., 1998). For a monoculture, 
lucerne is sown at a seed rate of between 18 and 25 kg/ha whereas red clover has 
a lower seed rate of between 12 and 15 kg/ha (Frame and Laidlaw, 2011). 
Successful germination of lucerne and red clover occurs when the seeds are sown 
in the spring, from April through to July, when soil temperatures are above 7C 
(Frame and Laidlaw, 2011).  
In the early stages of germination of lucerne, cotyledons emerge first followed by a 
unifoliate leaf (Frame et al., 1998). An alternating pattern of trifoliate leaves 
develop and produce leaflets; at the base of these leaflets, buds form to produce 
further stems (Frame, 2005). At the base of the stems, an accumulation of buds 
form a crown (Frame et al., 1998). Following harvest of lucerne, stems are 
produced from the crown buds allowing the plant to regrow (Frame et al., 1998; 
Frame, 2005). Lucerne flowers are purple in colour and following pollination, seed 
pods develop in a spiral coil. As the seed pods mature, a colour change from 
green to brown occurs as summarised in Table 8.  
Table 8 The stages of development of lucerne 
Stage Development stage 
0 Early vegetative: stems less than 15 cm 
1 Mid vegetative: plants are up to 50% height, stems 15  30 cm 
2 Late vegetative: stems over 30 cm tall, bud development beginning 
3 Early bud: One or two nodes with flower buds showing  
4 Late bud: Three or more nodes with flower buds 
5 Early flower: One open flower 
6 Late flower: Two or more open flowers 
7 Early seed pod: One to three green seed pods 
8 Late seed pod: Four or more green seed pods 
9 Rip seed pod: Seed pods, brown and mature 
Adapted from Frame et al., 1998 and Frame, 2005 
In the early stages of red clover germination, two cotyledons appear above ground 
while underground a radicle forms which will ultimately become the tap root for the 
plant reaching depths of up to 1 m (Frame et al., 1998; Frame, 2005). An unifoliate 
leaf develops between 5 and 10 days after germination, before trifoliate leaves 
form and develop into true leaves (Frame et al., 1998). Like lucerne, buds form a 
crown at the base of the plant, which develop into stems, and following defoliation 
or winter, stems develop from these buds allowing plant regrowth (Frame et al., 
1998). The flower head of red clover is pink in colour, seed pods develop after 
pollination containing up to two seeds, and seed colour can vary between brown, 
yellow and purple (Frame, 2005; Frame et al., 1998). Red clover can remain as a 
productive ley for between 2  3 years whereas lucerne remains productive for 
longer with a ley lasting between 4  6 years (Frame, 2005). 
1.7.2 Harvesting and ensiling 
For lucerne and red clover to begin germinating or regrowth after winter dormancy, 
the soil temperature must reach 7C, which is 2C higher than for grass, therefore 
harvesting of lucerne and red clover will begin between 3 to 4 weeks after grass 
(Wilkinson, 2005). The ideal growth stage to cut lucerne and red clover are early 
bud and early flowering stage, respectively (Lampkin, 1990). There are three 
stages to the harvesting process, before the forage reaches the clamp; mowing, 
wilting and harvesting which can all influence the successfulness of the final silage 
(Wilkinson, 2005). Wilting is an important process for lucerne and red clover as 
both plants can be sappy so should not be ensiled without wilting (Lampkin, 1990). 
However, the nutritive value of lucerne and red clover can be reduced during 
wilting particularly if the crop becomes too dry as leaves become brittle therefore 
shattering when the crop is harvested (McDonald et al., 2011). Harvesting of 
lucerne and red clover normally occurs between 24 and 48 hours after mowing 
depending on weather conditions at mowing and during wilting to ensure high 
nutritive value for the ensiling process (Wilkinson, 2005 and McDonald et al., 
2011).  
In the ensiling process, the elimination of oxygen from the freshly harvested crop 
is critical for the success of the silage (Merry et al., 2001; Wilkinson, 2005; and 
McDonald et al., 2011). Poor sealing of the silo can lead to nutrient losses as the 
crop respires and produces heat in the early stages of the ensiling process 
(Wilkinson, 2005). Rapid filling and complete sealing of the silo are therefore 
important to ensure anaerobic conditions (McDonald et al., 2011).  
The next stage of the ensiling process is the fermentation stage which involves a 
drop in pH due to fermentation of lactic acid bacteria in the forage (Wilkinson, 
2005; Sullivan and Hatfield, 2006). On the forage, lactic acid bacteria are present 
and begin fermenting the naturally occurring sugars, like glucose, to lactic acid 
when the forage is ensilaged (McDonald et al., 1991). If lactic acid production is 
low in the silo, other bacteria are able to grow, producing butyric acid that can 
degrade amino acids reducing the quality of the silage (McDonald et al., 1991). 
The rapid fall of pH to less than 5 and adequate quantities of naturally occurring 
sugars improves lactic acid production therefore eliminating the opportunity for 
detrimental bacteria to grow, improving overall quality of the silage (Owens et al., 
1999). Lucerne silage tends to have a higher pH than red clover silage, and 
Owens et al. (1999) observed pHs of 4.1 to 5.0 for lucerne while red clover pH 
values were lower at 4.0 to 4.4. These higher pH values observed in lucerne silage 
are due to lower levels of naturally occurring sugars in the crop and a higher 
buffering capacity (defined as the amount of acid needed to reduce forage pH 
from 6 to 4 per unit DM (Owens et al., 1999)). Legumes tend to have a higher 
buffering capacity than grass, with lucerne having the highest (McDonald et al., 
1991). 
Protein in the forage is broken down to amino acids and small peptides during the 
ensiling process, and in legume silages protein breakdown is large (McDonald et 
al., 1991; Sullivan and Hatfield., 2006; Schulz et al., 2018). The rate at which the 
pH of the forage reaches pH 5 or less is vital in the extent of degradation of protein 
in the silo (Sullivan and Hatfield, 2006). If pH falls slowly to 5 or less, the quantity 
of protein degraded is large therefore reducing the quality of the silage (Sullivan 
and Hatfield, 2006; Owens et al., 1999). Red clover and lucerne have a high 
protein content, and in lucerne, between 44 and 87 % of the protein in the forage 
is converted to non-protein nitrogen (NPN), whereas in red clover only 7  40 % is 
degraded (Jones et al., 1995). Unlike forage peas, lucerne and red clover contain 
very small amounts of naturally occurring condensed tannins. Lucerne silage 
contains no naturally occurring tannins whilst there are minor levels (2.3 g/kg DM) 
present in red clover silage (Hymes-Fecht et al., 2013). 
During the first year of a lucerne ley, the number of cuts of silage is half of what 
can be expected from the ley in the following years which can be up to four cuts 
(Lampkin, 1990). This difference in number of cuts is due to the slow 
establishment of lucerne following sowing. Red clover can be harvested up to 
three times in the first year of establishment and the following years of the ley 
(Lampkin, 1990). 
1.7.3 Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) 
Red clover contains an enzyme, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) that inhibits protein 
degradation by converting phenols into o-quinones which bind to the forage 
protein (Broderick et al., 2000; Hoffman et al., 1997; Jones et al., 1995). The PPO 
enzyme has been linked to the browning effect in ripening fruit and vegetables, 
whilst in the silo and rumen, PPO can initiate a decline in proteolysis and lipolysis 
(Lee et al., 2009b). A covalent bond forms between the amino acids and o-
quinones to produce a protein polymer (Figure 8; Igarashi & Yasui, 1985; Lee et 
al., 2009a). The enzyme PPO is located in the chloroplast of the red clover plant 
and can be present in two forms; active and latent (Lee, 2014). Approximately 
10% of PPO enzyme found in the red clover plant will be in the active form whilst 
90% will be present in the latent form with both forms functioning at a neutral pH 
(Lee et al., 2009b). The latent form of PPO becomes activated during the ensiling 
process due to proteolytic activity and endogenous substances, therefore 
increasing the amount of active PPO available to bind to protein and protect the 
protein from degradation in the silo (Lee et al., 2009b). Therefore, the presence of 
PPO in red clover silage reduces proteolysis in the silo by protecting the protein 
from plant proteases (Lee et al., 2009b). In the first two hours following cutting of 
the crop, there is an initial rise in PPO activity due to the activation of the latent 
form; as the o-quinones bind to the protein, PPO activity declines (Lee, 2014).  
Figure 8 The reaction of the PPO enzyme where o-quinone binds with forage 
protein to form a protein-bound protein. After Lee, (2014) and modified from Lee et 
al., (2013). 
The amount of PPO activity in red clover plants varies between plants and 
previous studies have investigated the effects of length of growth and how the red 
clover is treated following cutting. Table 9 summarises the activity of PPO enzyme 
in red clover plants in some previous studies (Lee et al., 2009a; Lee et al., 2009b). 
Conditioning the red clover plant decreased PPO activity by 135.9 U/g of DM, 
however protein-bound phenol increased by 5.02 g/kg DM in Lee et al. (2009b). In 
the study by Lee et al. (2009a), PPO activity in all three varieties of red clover 
decreased as regrowth length increased from 4 to 8 weeks. However, protein-
bound phenol remained unchanged in both high and low PPO activity red clover 
plants as length of regrowth increased from 4 to 8 weeks, whereas in the wild type 
red clover protein-bound phenol decreased by 16 mg/g protein. The PPO enzyme 
requires oxygen to be active, therefore in the anaerobic conditions of the rumen, 
PPO enzyme becomes inactive (Lee, 2014). For the PPO enzyme to be effective 
in a dairy cows diet, the protection of protein has to occur prior to ingestion in the 
silo (Lee, 2014). Protein that has become bound to o-quinones in the silo are 
protected from microbial attack, therefore this protein flows through the rumen and 
becomes available for digestion as rumen undegradable protein in the small 
intestine (Lee, 2014). Consequently, the PPO enzyme present in red clover silage 
can reduce the degradation of forage protein in the silo and improve the availability 
of RUP to the small intestine. Lucerne does not contain polyphenol oxidase hence 
the difference between the quantities of protein degraded in red clover and 
lucerne.

1.7.4 Effects of PPO on milk fat 
Generally, the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in milk is greater 
when dairy cows are feed red clover silage compared to grass silages (Van Ranst 
et al., 2011). These changes in PUFAs have been suggested to be due to the 
presence of PPO in the red clover, providing protection to the lipids from 
metabolism within the rumen, allowing for a higher concentration of fatty acids in 
the milk (Lee et al., 2009b; Leduc et al., 2017). In a study conducted by Lee et al. 
(2009b), cows were offered either fresh grass or red clover, or conditioned red 
clover silage; milk fat was similar for all three treatments averaging 39.5 g/kg. 
However, there was a change in milk fatty acid profile, milk from cows fed either 
diet containing red clover had higher levels of C18:2 n-6 and C18:3 n-3 than cows 
fed the grass diet. Lee et al. (2009b) concluded that the C18 PUFAs were being 
provided protection in the rumen by the presence of PPO in the red clover thereby 
elevating the concentrations of FAs found in the milk. Similarly, in a study 
conducted by Dewhurst et al. (2003), dairy cows were offered either grass or red 
clover silage, milk FA C16:0 was reduced in cows offered red clover silage 
whereas concentrations of C18:3 n-3 was higher compared to cows offered grass 
silage. Therefore, the recovery of C18:3 n-3 from the diet to the milk was higher by 
4.6% in red clover silage. Dewhurst et al. (2003) suggested that the rumen 
biohydrogenation was reduced by the presence of red clover silage in the diet. 
Halmemies-Beauchet-Filleau et al. (2014) reported a linear decrease in short and 
medium-chain FAs as the amount of red clover silage increased in the diet from 0 
to 100%, whereas there was a linear increase in concentrations of C18:2 n-6 and 
C18:3 n-3. In an earlier study, Halmemies-Beauchet-Filleau et al. (2013) observed 
a linear increase in the flow of C18:2 n-6 and C18:3 n-3 to the omasum of 24 to 32 
g/d and 11 to 21 g/d, respectively, as red clover silage in the diet increased from 0 
to 100%, therefore a reduction in lipolysis and biohydrogenation of these fatty 
acids was occurring within the rumen. Therefore, it can be concluded that the 
presence of PPO in red clover silage can provide protection of dietary PUFAs from 
lipolysis and biohydrogenation in the rumen, influencing the milk fatty acid profile 
of dairy cows.  
1.7.5 Feeding value 
A number of studies have examined feeding red clover and lucerne to dairy cows, 
and in particular studying stage of maturity, wilting, supplementation and different 
levels of forage within the diet as summarised in Table 10 and 11. Moorby et al. 
(2016), offered dairy cows third cut red clover silage at different inclusion rates of 
10, 50 and 90 % of forage DM replacing maize silage. As red clover silage 
inclusion increased from 10 to 90 %, the DM and CP of the diet increased from 
338 to 516 g/kg and 107 to 163 g/kg DM, respectively, while starch content of the 
diet decreased from 23.9 to 2.5 % DM. Dry matter intake and milk yields were 
improved by 1 and 1.4 kg/d, respectively, in dairy cows fed the 50:50 red clover to 
maize silage diet therefore, Moorby et al. (2016) concluded that an equal mixture 
was the ideal combination in maize silage based diets.

1Inclusion rate as a % forage DM 
Moorby et al. (2009) compared different levels of red clover and grass silage in the 
diet of dairy cows. Cows were offered third cut red clover silage at rates of 0, 34, 
66 and 100 % with grass silage included at 100, 66, 34 and 0 % respectively. The 
DM and CP content decreased as the proportion of red clover silage increased in 
the diet (Moorby et al., 2009). Dry matter intake increased linearly from 13.2 to 
15.5 kg/d as red clover increased in the diet, however milk yield was highest at 
26.5 kg/d in the diet containing 66 % red clover silage. From these two studies, it 
can be concluded that milk production is greatest when red clover silage is 
between 50 to 66 % of the overall forage ratio in grass silage based diets.  
Sinclair et al. (2015), included lucerne at three rates, 20, 40 and 60 % of the 
forage DM with maize making up the remaining proportion (in the 20 % diet, grass 
and lucerne silage was included at 20%) and reported a decrease in DM intake 
when lucerne was included at 60 % of the forage DM. However milk yield was 
similar across all rates of inclusion averaging 40.9 kg/d for cows that were 61 days 
in milk. In a similar study, Arndt et al. (2015) examined four different rates of 
inclusion of lucerne in a maize based diet. Unlike Sinclair et al. (2015), Arndt et al., 
(2015) reported no effect of inclusion level of lucerne on DM intake or milk yield 
which averaged 24.6 kg/d and 37.8 kg/d, respectively for dairy cows that were 136 
days in milk. Milk production was higher in the study of Sinclair et al. (2015) which 
could be associated with the cut of lucerne silage as Hoffman et al. (1998) 
observed higher milk yields in cows (61 days in milk) fed lucerne silage when 
harvested early. 
In a study conducted by Broderick et al. (2000), red clover and lucerne silage were 
compared as the sole forage in a total mixed ration fed to dairy cows. Lucerne was 
a mixture of second and third cut silage while red clover was a mixture of first and 
second cut silage. The DM content of lucerne silage was 56 g/kg lower than red 
clover silage, whereas CP content was 36 g/kg DM higher. Broderick et al. (2000) 
reported that DM intake and milk yield improved by 1.2 kg/d and 1.3 kg/d 
respectively, when cows were fed lucerne silage. In contrast, Broderick et al. 
(2001) observed higher DM intakes when lucerne replaced red clover silage but 
there was no difference in milk yield. The observations in study of Broderick et al. 
(2001) in DM intakes were suggested to be due to the 120 g/kg difference in DM 
content between the lucerne and red clover silage with lucerne being higher, 
whereas the CP content was only 19 g/kg DM lower in red clover silage.

Hoffman et al. (1997) investigated the effects of early and late harvesting of 
lucerne and red clover silages when fed to dairy cows, over two years. In year 1, 
milk yields were similar in cows fed lucerne and red clover silage, however harvest 
time influenced milk yield, with silages harvested early, resulting in milk yields that 
were 3.5 kg/d higher in cows fed early lucerne and red clover silages. In contrast, 
in year 2, milk yields were 2.55 kg/d lower in cows fed lucerne silage, and time of 
harvest had no effect on milk yield. In both years, DM intake was similar in cows 
fed lucerne or red clover silage averaging 20.6 and 20.0 kg/d respectively 
(Hoffman et al., 1997) and it was concluded that forages harvested early had the 
potential for higher DM intake and suggested milk yield was supported by 
mobilisation of body fat reserves when late harvested forages were fed.  
1.8 Gaps in current knowledge 
Following an extensive review of the literature, it is clear that the gaps in the 
current knowledge of using forage legumes as silages for high yielding dairy cows 
are:- 
 Forage peas and red clover contain varying levels of naturally occurring 
condensed tannins which have the potential to improve the availability of by-
pass protein from forage legumes which tend to be high in RDP. Tannins can 
occur naturally or can be supplemented at ensiling. The addition of condensed 
or hydrolysable tannins at ensiling has primarily focussed on grass silage with 
observed increases in total N post ensiling. There have been very few studies 
investigating the effects of tannins on nutritive value using forage legumes like 
lucerne, red clover or forage peas. Therefore, this is a key area that needs to 
be researched further to investigate whether condensed or hydrolysable 
tannins have the ability to improve the availability of RUP during the ensiling 
process.  
 Previously, forage peas have been fed to dairy cows as a bi-crop with wheat, in 
these studies milk yields tended to be higher than in cows fed grass silage. 
However, only a few studies have investigated forage peas as a whole crop 
pea silage in a maize silage based diet. These studies have focussed on low 
yielding dairy cows, and it was observed that DMI was higher in cows fed 
forage pea silages compared to cows fed grass silage. It was observed that 
milk yields remained similar for cows fed either grass or forage pea silages. 
Therefore, research needs to investigate the effects of feeding forage pea 
silage to high yielding dairy cows on animal performance, digestibility and 
degradability.   
 Many studies have compared red clover silage and lucerne silage in high 
yielding dairy cows, generally cows performed similarly on either silage. 
Although, cows fed red clover silage tended to have a higher N efficiency due 
to less extensive proteolysis in the silo allowing for a higher availability of RUP. 
The addition of tannins to lucerne or red clover silage is an area of research 
that has very few studies. Generally it is reported that there is no change in 
milk production when tannins are added to the diet at feed out. Previous 
studies have reported a decline in DMI when condensed tannins have been 
included at rates above 30 g/kg DM at feed out. Studies have not investigated 
the effects of hydrolysable tannins added at ensiling to red clover or lucerne 
silage on animal performance of high yielding dairy cows, therefore, this is 
another area that requires further research. 
1.9 Conclusions 
Global demand for soya bean meal has risen in recent years, thus influencing the 
cost and availability of SBM to the UK ruminant industry. This volatility in SBM and 
other purchased feed has resulted in greater interest in the utilisation of home 
grown protein sources in particular, forage legumes including lucerne, red clover 
and forage peas conserved as a silage. Forage legumes are crops that grow well 
in temperate regions like the UK and North America. Compared to traditional grass 
silage, forage legumes require less nitrogen fertiliser during growth due to their 
ability to fix nitrogen, therefore reducing costs to produce the silage. Forage 
legumes have high crude protein levels ranging between 170 to 220 g/kg DM, 
although this protein degrades rapidly within the rumen resulting in low amounts of 
rumen undegradable protein reaching the small intestine. Although, in red clover 
silage, the presence of PPO has the potential to improve the availability of RUP 
due to the binding with protein in the forage during the ensiling process, the 
protein becomes available for digestion in the small intestine. High yielding dairy 
cows require high levels of RUP to improve and maintain high milk yields. High 
levels of RUP can improve N efficiency in high yielding dairy cows, however forage 
legumes have low levels of RUP resulting in reduced N efficiency. Tannins are 
phenolic compounds that can be classified as condensed or hydrolysable, and can 
occur naturally or be added to the forage legume at either ensiling or feed-out. 
Tannins can potentially reduce the amount of RDP that occurs in forage legumes 
as the tannins bind with the protein and form complexes at pH 4.5  7. These 
tannin-protein complexes can form during ensiling or within the rumen, and 
dissociate in the small intestine improving the amount of by-pass protein available 
for absorption in a high yielding dairy cow. Therefore, the potential to alter protein 
degradability of forage legumes by supplementation of tannins at ensiling or by 
naturally occurring tannins requires investigation in high yielding dairy cows.  
1.10 Experimental hypothesis and objectives 
The overall hypothesis of this thesis was that the utilisation of N from home grown 
forages can be improved by using naturally occurring condensed tannins in 
legumes or the addition of hydrolysable tannins at ensiling, reducing the 
requirement for purchased dietary protein and improving the performance of high 
yielding dairy cows. 
The first objective of this study was to investigate the effects of condensed and 
hydrolysable tannins that occur naturally or are added to forage legumes on their 
nutritive value post ensiling. Following on from this, the second objective of this 
study was to investigate the effects of feeding forage pea silages with naturally 
occurring condensed tannins or lucerne and red clover silages supplemented with 
hydrolysable tannins at ensiling on the utilisation of nitrogen and performance of 
high yielding dairy cows. 
Chapter 2  General Material and Methods 
2.1 Dry Matter (DM) 
Forage and TMR samples were oven dried at 105C for 24 h to a constant weight 
according to AOAC (2012; 943.01). Samples were cooled in a desiccator and 
weighed. Residues from the in situ degradation study and faecal samples were 
oven dried at 60C for 48 h. A cyclone mill (Cyclotec, FOSS, Warrington, UK) with 
a 1 mm screen was used to mill all dried samples. Dry matter was calculated as 
follows: 
Dry matter (g/kg) = 
(   ())
(   ())
  1000  Equation 2.1 
2.2 Crude protein (CP) 
Nitrogen content of dried forage, TMR, faecal and residue in situ degradation 
samples was measured using a Leco FP-528 (Leco Corporation, St Joseph, MI) 
operating the Dumas method according to AOAC (2012; 990.03). Approximately 
0.15 g forage, TMR and faecal samples; and 0.10 g of residue of in situ samples 
were weighed into aluminium foil trays and placed on to the Leco FP-528. Crude 
protein was calculated as follows: 
Crude protein (g/kg DM) = total nitrogen (g/kg) x 6.25  Equation 2.2 
2.3 Organic matter (OM) 
Organic matter was determined by weighing approximately 2 g of dried forage and 
TMR sample in to a pre-weighed porcelain crucible. Samples were placed in a 
muffle furnace (Carbolite AAF 1100, Hope Valley, England) at 550C for 4 h, 
samples were cooled in a desiccator and weighed. Ash and organic matter was 
calculated as follows: 
Ash (g/kg DM) = 
  ()

  1000   Equation 2.3a 
OM (g/kg DM) = 1000  ash (g/kg DM)    Equation 2.3b 
2.4 Neutral detergent fibre (NDF) 
Neutral detergent fibre (NDF) was determined according to Van Soest et al. 
(1991). Approximately 0.5 g of dried forage, TMR or faecal sample was weighed 
into a pre-weighed glass crucible (porosity 1, Soham Scientific, Ely, UK) and 
placed onto Fibertec apparatus (1020, FOSS, Warrington, UK). To each crucible, 
25 ml of neutral detergent reagent (93 g of di-sodium ethylene diamine tetra-acetic 
acid dehydrate (EDTA) and 34 g of sodium tetraborate was dissolved in 
approximately 3 L of hot distilled water, 150 g of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) 
and 50 ml of tri-ethlylene glycol was added. In a small beaker with approximately 
500 ml of hot distilled water, 22.8 g of anhydrous disodium hydrogen phosphate 
was dissolved. The contents of the small beaker were added to the first solution 
and mixed together, the volume was made up to 5 L and the pH adjusted to lie 
between 6.9 and 7.1 with either 0.1 M NaOH or 0.1 M HCl) and 0.5 ml octan-1-ol 
was added.  
Samples were boiled and digested for 30 minutes, a further 25 ml of neutral 
detergent reagent was added to each crucible along with 2 ml alpha amylase (2 g 
of alpha amylase (80 EU/mg, Sigma, Gillingham, UK) was dissolved in 90 ml 
distilled water and 10 ml tri-ethylene glycol). Samples were boiled and digested for 
a further 30 minutes, filtered and washed with 3 x 25 ml of hot distilled water 
(80C) to remove the neutral detergent reagent. Following washing, 2 ml alpha 
amylase and 25 ml hot distilled water (80C) was added to each sample and 
allowed to stand for 15 minutes. Samples were filtered and washed with 3 x 25 ml 
of hot distilled water (80C), crucibles removed from the Fibretec apparatus and 
oven dried at 105C overnight. The crucibles were cooled in a desiccator and 
weighed before being placed in a muffle furnace at 550C for 16 h. Crucibles were 
cooled in a desiccator and reweighed.

2.5 pH 
Forage pH was determined using the method of MAFF, (1986) where water extract 
of the silage was determined using a Jenway 3505 pH probe and meter (Bibby 
Scientific Limited, Staffordshire, UK). The pH probe was calibrated daily using pH 
4 and 7 buffers. Approximately, 50 g of forage was placed in a beaker and 125 ml 
distilled water added. Samples were stirred every 15 minutes for 1 h, and the pH 
determined. The pH probe was cleaned with distilled water between each sample. 
2.6 Ammonia nitrogen 
Forage ammonia nitrogen was determined using a method adapted from MAFF 
(1986) using an auto-titrator (FOSS 1030 auto-titrator, FOSS, Warrington, UK and 
Buchi Labortechnik AG CH-9230, Flawil, Switzerland). Approximately, 20 g fresh 
forage was weighed into a glass shaking bottle and 100 ml of distilled water 
added. Samples were shaken for 1 h on a laboratory shaker at 275 stokes per 
minute. After shaking, the water extract was filtered (150 mm Whatman number 1 
filter paper) and 5 ml of filtrate transferred to a Kjeldahl digestion tube. To each 
sample, 6 ml magnesium oxide (17 g heavy magnesium oxide dissolved in 100 ml 
distilled water) was added prior to the sample being analysed by the auto-titrator.

Where T was the titre reading  blank. 
2.7 Feed fatty acids 
Feed fatty acid (FA) content of forage and TMR samples were determined 
according to Jenkins, (2010). Approximately, 0.5 g of dried, ground forage sample 
was weighed into a 16x125 mm screw cap Pyrex culture tube, 1 ml of methyl 
C19:0 (100 mg C19:0 in 50 ml methanol, dissolved in a water bath) and 2 ml of 
sodium methoxide (1.75 ml methanol added to 0.2 ml 30% sodium methoxide 
solution) was added. Samples were vortexed lightly for 30 seconds, and incubated 
in a water bath at 50C for 10 minutes. Samples were then removed from the 
water bath and allowed to cool for 5 minutes. To each sample, 3 ml of 5% 
methanolic HCl (on a magnetic stirrer in a fume cupboard, a conical flask in a 
beaker with ice ensuring no ice enters the conical flask. To the flask 100 ml of 
methanol was added and 10 ml acetyl chloride slowly added) was added. Samples 
were vortexed lightly for 30 seconds and incubated in a hot water bath at 80C for 
10 minutes. Samples were then removed from the water bath and cooled for 7 
minutes. To each sample, 3 ml hexane and 10 ml of 6% K2CO3 (6 g K2CO3 in 100 
ml distilled water) was added. Samples were then vortexed for 5 minutes and 1 g 
of anhydrous sodium sulphate added to each sample. If the sample was coloured 
then 0.5 g of charcoal was added or if it was highly coloured then 0.75 g of 
charcoal was added as the sample must be clear to be run through the GC. 
Samples were then centrifuged at 500 g for 5 minutes. A glass pipette was used to 
collect the hexane layer containing FAME into a GC vial. Feed and milk FAME in 
hexane were analysed using a Hewlett-Packard 6890 gas chromatograph (GC) 
(Germany) fitted with a 100m CP Sil 88 column (CP Sil 88, Agilent Technologies, 
UK) as described by Lock et al. (2006). Alongside the column, the GC contained 
an automatic sampler and flame ionization detector. Firstly, an oven temperature 
of 70C was reached and remained steady for 2 min before a gradual increase to 
110C by 8C/min. The temperature of 110C remained for 4 min before 
increasing to 170C by 5C/min and remained at this temperature for 10 min. 
Following this, a final increase to 225C occurred by 4C/min and this temperature 
was held for 15 min. A run time lasted 61.75 min followed by a 1 min post run at 
70C. Individual FAME standards (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) were used to identify peaks 
in feed and milk fatty acid.

2.8 Tannin content 
Tannin content of forages was determined according to Makkar et al. (1993). Dried 
forage sample, 0.4 g, was weighed into a 50 ml tube and 20 ml of 70% aqueous 
acetone (30 ml distilled water was added to 70 ml acetone) added. Samples were 
centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 minutes at 4C, the liquid tannin extract was collected 
into a clean tube and stored at 4C. 
2.8.1 Total Phenols 
Fifty microlitres (50 l) of tannin extract as prepared in section 2.8 was added to 
950 l of distilled water. To each sample, 1.25 ml of 20% sodium carbonate 
solution (50 g of sodium carbonate was dissolved in 250 ml of distilled water) was 
added. Then 0.5 ml of 1N folin ciocalteu (an equal volume of distilled water was 
added to 2N folin ciocalteu reagent, the resultant solution was kept at 4C in a 
dark bottle) was added in a dark room. Samples were vortexed and kept in the 
dark for 40 minutes. Sample absorbance was measured on a spectrophotometer 
(Jenway 6305 Spectrophotometer, Bibby Scientific Ltd, Dunmon, Essex, UK) at 
725 nm. Total phenol concentration was estimated from a calibration curve as a 
tannic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) equivalent of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 
and 100 mg/ml.    
2.8.2 Non tannin phenols 
In a glass tube, 100 mg of polypyrrolidone (PVPP which binds to the tannins) was 
added to 1 ml of distilled water and 1 ml of tannin extract as prepared in section 
2.8. A blank sample was prepared with 100 mg PVPP, 1 ml distilled water and 1 
ml 70 % aqueous acetone. Samples were vortexed and placed in a fridge at 4C. 
After 15 minutes, samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 minutes 
at 4C. After centrifuging, there were two layers, a white bottom layer and a clear 
liquid top layer. Fifty microlitres (50 l) of the supernatant was transferred into a 
tube and 950 l distilled water added along with 1.25 ml of 20% sodium carbonate 
solution. In a dark room, 0.5 ml 1N folin coicalteu was added to each sample prior 
to being vortexed. Samples were then kept in dark conditions for 40 minutes and 
the optical density measured using a spectrophotometer at 725 nm. Non tannin 
phenol concentration was estimated from a calibration curve as a tannic acid 
equivalent of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100 mg/ml. Total tannin was 
calculated as follows: 
Total tannin (g/kg DM) = Total phenols (g/kg)  Non-tannin phenols (g/kg) Eq. 2.7 
2.8.3 Condensed tannin 
In both a plastic and glass test tube, 0.3 ml of 70% aqueous acetone was added to 
0.2 ml tannin extract as prepared in section 2.8. To each sample, 3 ml of butanol 
HCl (50 ml of concentrated HCl was added to 950 ml butanol) and 0.1 ml ferric 
reagent (16.6 ml concentrated HCl diluted with 20 ml distilled water and 2 g ferric 
ammonium sulphate was added and dissolved. The volume was made up to 100 
ml with distilled water) was added. All samples were vortexed, and a glass marble 
used to cover the mouth of the glass tubes and then boiled at 97C to 100C for 1 
h. The plastic tubes (blanks) were left at room temperature for 1 h without heating. 
Glass tubes were removed from the water bath and cooled to room temperature. 
The optical density was measured at 550 nm on a spectrophotometer with the 
sample (glass tube) being measured against the blank (plastic tube). Condensed 
tannins were calculated as follows: 
 CT (%) = 
  78.26   
  (%)
     Equation 2.8 
2.9 Forage volatile fatty acids (VFAs) 
Forage samples were sent to Sciantec Analytical (Stockbridge Technology Centre, 
North Yorkshire, UK) for determination of fermentation acids, lactic, acetic, 
propionic and butyric acids using gas chromatography with FID detection.  
2.10 Milk composition  
Milk composition of fat, protein and lactose were measured on a Milkoscan minor 
spectrophotometer (Foss Ltd., Denmark) calibrated by the methods of AOAC 
(2012).  
2.11 Milk fatty acids 
Milk fatty acids were extracted according to Feng et al. (2004) in Experiment 2 and 
Hara and Radin, (1987) in Experiment 3. All samples were methylated according 
to Christie, (1982) modified from Chouinard et al. (1999). 
2.11.1 Extraction (Experiment 2)  
Milk samples were placed in a water bath at 40C for 20 minutes, and shaken 
occasionally to disperse the milk fat. In a 50 ml conical plastic tube, 30 ml of fresh 
milk from the AM and PM were combined according to milk yield. Samples were 
then centrifuged at 17,800 g for 30 minutes at 4C, and separated into two layers, 
fat cake and water bottom layer. For each sample, 1 g of fat cake was transferred 
in to a 2 ml Eppendorf and left at room temperature for 20 minutes. Samples were 
then centrifuged at 19,300 g for 30 minutes at room temperature using a micro 
centrifuge (Beckman, Avanti 30 Centrifuge, Harbor Boulevard, California). After 
centrifuging, the fat separated into three layers, a lipid top layer; a protein, fat and 
other water-insoluble solids and a water bottom layer. The lipid layer of each 
sample was carefully transferred to two 0.5 ml Eppendorf tubes. Samples were 
stored at -20C until methylation. 
2.11.2 Extraction (Experiment 3)  
In a 50 ml conical plastic tube, 35 ml of fresh milk from the AM and PM milkings 
were combined according to milk yield. Samples were then centrifuged at 17,800 g 
for 30 minutes at 4C. Approximately, 300 mg of the fat cake layer was transferred 
into a 16x150 extraction tube that was pre-rinsed with hexane. To each sample, 
5.4 ml hexane:isopropanol (600 ml hexane added to 400 ml isopropanol (3:2) and 
50 mg butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) dissolved into the solution) was added, 
samples were vortexed for 30 seconds. To separate the hexane from the 
isopropanol, 3.6 ml sodium sulphate (1 g sodium sulphate anahydrous dissolved in 
15 ml distilled water) was added to each sample. Samples were then vortexed for 
30 seconds and allowed to stand before a further 30 seconds of vortexing. 
Samples were then left to stand and separate, if the sample had not separated 
well, samples were centrifuged at 2600 g for 5 minutes at 5C. Sodium sulphate, 
1g, was weighted into a new hexane pre-rinsed 16x150 extraction tube. The top 
hexane layer of each sample was transferred into the tube containing sodium 
sulphate, tubes were capped and left to stand for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, the 
top hexane and milk lipid layer was transferred to a new 16x150 extraction tube 
pre-rinsed with hexane, and the tubes placed in a water bath at 40C. The hexane 
was evaporated off with nitrogen to leave the milk lipid, which was transferred into 
a 0.5 ml eppendorf tube and stored at -20C until methylation. 
2.11.3 Methylation 
Lipid samples were placed in an incubator at 40C for 20 minutes until the lipid 
had melted, then 50 mg of lipid was weighed into a 16x150 extraction tube pre-
rinsed with hexane. To each sample, 2 ml hexane and 40 l methyl acetate was 
added. Samples were then vortexed for 30 seconds, 40 l methylation reagent 
(1.75 ml methanol mixed with 0.4 ml 30% sodium methoxide solution, and used 
within 24 h) was added to each sample and vortexed for 2 minutes. Samples were 
left to stand for a further 8 minutes, with the reaction being complete 10 minutes 
after the addition of methylation reagent. To each sample, 60 l termination 
reagent (a reagent bottle was placed in an oven at 105C for 30 minutes to 
remove water and cooled in a desiccator. Oxalic acid was weighed (1g) into the 
bottle and the bottle placed in the oven again at 105C for a further 30 minutes. 
After cooling in a desiccator, 30 ml diethyl ether was added. The reagent was 
stored in the dark and used within 2 weeks) was added and samples vortexed for 
30 seconds. Approximately, 200 mg calcium chloride was added to each sample 
which were then vortexed and left to stand for 1 h. Samples were centrifuged at 
2600 g for 30 minutes at 5C and the top layer of FAME and hexane was 
transferred to GC vials. The FAME in hexane was analysed using a Hewlett-
Packard 6890 gas chromatograph (GC) fitted with a 100 m CP Sil 88 column as 
described in section 2.7.  
2.12 Blood analysis 
Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein via venepuncture into 
vacutainer tubes containing EDTA and fluoride/potassium oxalate. Blood samples 
were centrifuged at 1390 g for 10 minutes at 4C to separate the plasma. All 
plasma samples were analysed for total protein (TP), urea, beta-hydroxybutryrate 
(BHB), glucose, albumin and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs). Plasma samples 
were analysed on a Cobas-Mira Plus auto-analyser (ABX Diagnostics, 
Bedfordshire, UK). Kits used for analysis were TP, Ref TP245; UREA, Ref UR221; 
RANBUT, Ref RB1008; GLUC-HK, Ref GU611; ALBUMIN, Ref AB362; and NEFA, 
Ref FA115, respectively. 
2.13 Acid insoluble ash (AIA) 
Acid insoluble ash of faecal and TMR samples were determined according to Van 
Keulen and Young, (1977). Approximately 5 g of dried, ground faecal or TMR 
sample was weighed in to a pre-weighed porcelain crucible and ashed in a muffle 
furnace at 550C for 4 hours. Samples were then cooled in a desiccator and re-
weighed. Each sample was transferred to a digestion tube with 10 ml of 2M 
hydrochloric acid (HCl) used to wash out the porcelain crucible in to the digestion 
tube. A further 90 ml of 2M HCl was added to each sample, samples were heated 
to 175C and boiled for 10 minutes. Following boiling, samples were allowed to 
cool and then filtered through ashless filter paper (150 mm Whatman number 1 
filter paper). Samples were washed with hot (80C) distilled water to remove 
excess acid. Each sample in the filter paper was placed into a porcelain crucible 
and ashed in a muffle furnace at 550C for 4 hours. Samples were then cooled in 
a desiccator and re-weighed. Feed and faecal AIA were calculated as follows:

2.14 In situ degradation characteristics 
Three mature wethers sheep fitted with a permanent rumen cannulae and with a 
mean live weight of 76.5 kg were used. The sheep were group housed on straw 
under continuous lighting with free access to clean water. The sheep were offered 
a basal diet of haylage and concentrate (Ram Master Coarse Mix, Wynnstay, 
Shropshire, UK; Table 12) providing a forage to concentrate ratio of 60:40 DM 
basis. Concentrate feed was offered in two equal meals at 0830 and 1630 h.

Approximately 8 g of fresh forage was weighed into synthetic in situ bags with a 
pore size of 42 m with a rounded base to prevent lodging of the sample. Each 
bag was sealed by threading the neck of the bag through a brass curtain ring; the 
neck was then folded over and secured by a rubber band. Each bag was 
connected by the brass curtain ring to a stainless steel clip on a 30 cm nylon cord 
attached to the cannula cap. Bags were inserted 30 minutes post feeding and 
incubated in the rumen for a period of either 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 48 or 72 h with each 
forage incubated in duplicate in each animal. Following rumen incubation, bags 
were placed in a bucket of cold water to prevent further microbial action, and then 
washed on a cold rinse cycle of a commercial washing machine. For each forage, 
a set of bags were washed without rumen incubation to determine the zero hour 
time point. Following washing, all bags were dried at 60C for 48 h to a constant 
weight and the residue bulked for each time point for each sheep prior to analysis 
for DM and CP. 
Chapter 3  Experiment 1: The effect of condensed and hydrolysable 
tannins at varying rates of inclusion on the nutritional value of legume 
silages  
3.1 Background 
In recent years, due to their high protein content and nitrogen fixing abilities, 
legumes have become of greater interest for ensiling as a winter forage and 
protein source for dairy cows (Schulz et al., 2017). During the wilting period and 
ensiling process, forage legumes undergo extensive proteolysis of protein to non-
protein nitrogen (NPN), reducing the amount of true protein available in the 
conserved forage (Tabacco et al., 2006). Condensed and hydrolysable tannins are 
a group of secondary plant metabolites that have an ability to bind with protein to 
form a pH dependent complex structure (Mueller-Harvey, 2006). These protein-
tannin structures can form during the ensiling process protecting protein from plant 
enzyme hydrolysis (Tabacco et al., 2006; Salawu et al., 1999). Plant proteases 
activity is highest at pH 6  7; tannins bind with forage protein between pH 4.5 and 
7 therefore are able to reduce the extent of protein degradation in the silo 
(Henderson, 1993; Salawu et al., 1999). In a study conducted by Tabacco et al. 
(2006), lucerne silage was supplemented with chestnut (hydrolysable) tannins at 
four inclusion rates, 0, 20, 40 and 60 g/kg DM at ensiling. The NPN levels 
decreased from 75.9 % of total N to 62.6 % of total N as inclusion rate of tannin 
increased from 0 to 60 g/kg DM, respectively, suggesting protection of the protein 
during the ensiling process.  
Forage legumes have varying amounts of naturally occurring tannins. Lucerne 
silage contains no naturally occurring tannins whilst there are minor levels (2.3 
g/kg DM) present in red clover silage (Hymes-Fecht et al., 2013). Condensed 
tannins occur naturally in forage peas with flower colour indicating the level of 
tannin present, white flowers indicate low levels while coloured flowers indicate 
high levels (Wang et al., 1998). Hart et al. (2011) and Sinclair et al. (2009) 
reported condensed tannin levels of 47.3 and 92.7 g/kg DM for white and coloured 
forage pea silage, respectively. There is little information on the effects of tannins 
on ensiling properties therefore, the study objectives were to determine the effects 
of the addition of different inclusion rates of condensed and hydrolysable tannins 
at ensiling on the nutritional value of grass, lucerne, red clover, red pea and white 
pea silages. 
3.2 Materials and Methods 
3.2.1 Forages, tannin types and tannin inclusion rates 
The five forages, two tannin types and four tannin inclusion rates used to make 
mini silos in this study are shown in Table 13. Each forage received treatment of 
the two tannin types at four tannin inclusion rates, with each forage sample being 
replicated by four mini silos. Five forages; lucerne (Medicago sativa), red clover 
(Trifolium pratense), grass (Lolium multiflorum), white pea (Pisum sativum; 
Montara) and red pea (Pisum sativum; Daytona) were harvested during June and 
July 2014. Both pea silages were mown at approximately 1000 h on the 3rd of July 
2014 when the crop had reached growth stage 206 (pod swollen with small seeds) 
(Knott, 1987). A front mounted drum mower without a conditioner was used with a 
stubble of 10 cm. The peas were wilted for approximately 30 hours prior to being 
picked up by a precision chop, self-propelled forage harvester with an additive 
added (Axcool Gold, Biotal Ltd, Pontprenna, Cardiff; 4 l/tonne. Axcool Gold is an 
inoculant containing the bacteria L. buchneri  40788). The grass silage was a 
second cut ley of predominantly rye grass and white clover, wilted for 
approximately 24 hours and harvested on 25th June 2014 using a precision chop, 
self-propelled forage harvester with an additive added (Axcool Gold, Biotal Ltd, 
Pontprenna, Cardiff; 4 l/tonne). The lucerne silage was a first cut ley, wilted for 24 
hours and harvested on 1st June 2014 using a precision chop, self-propelled 
forage harvester with an additive added (Axcool Gold, Biotal Ltd, Pontprenna, 
Cardiff; 4 l/tonne). The red clover silage was a second cut ley, wilted for 24 hours 
and harvested on 12th June 2014 using a forage wagon with an additive added 
(Axcool Gold, Biotal Ltd, Pontprenna, Cardiff; 4 l/tonne).

Two tannin types; chestnut hydrolysable tannins (Inovitec Ltd, Cheshire, UK) and 
quebracho condensed tannins (Inovitec Ltd, Cheshire, UK) were added to the five 
forages as a liquid (tannins were mixed with water as a 30 % solution based on 
DM weight) at four inclusion rates; 0, 25, 50 and 75 g/kg DM before ensiling. Pipes 
of length 33 cm and diameter 14 cm attached to a wooden base were lined with 
two plastic bags. Approximately 1 kg of fresh silage was placed in the plastic bags 
and compressed down. Bags were then sealed with silage tape, sand placed on 
top and the mini silo sealed with silage tape. Mini silos were stored at ambient 
temperature and opened 128  7 days following harvest. Following opening, the 
mini silos were sub-sampled and stored at -20C until subsequent analysis. 
3.2.2 Chemical analysis 
Forage samples were analysed for DM (943.01), crude protein (990.03), and ash 
(942.05) according to AOAC (2012) as described in Chapter 2. The NDF content 
was determined according to Van Soest et al. (1991) as described in section 2.4. 
Crude protein was determined using a Leco FP-528 (Leco Corporation, St Joseph, 
MI). Forage pH was determined using a method by MAFF, (1986) using a Jenway 
3505 pH meter (Bibby Scientific Limited, Staffordshire, UK). Ammonia nitrogen 
was determined using a method adapted from MAFF, (1986) using an auto-titrator 
(FOSS 1030 auto-titrator, FOSS, Warrington, UK and Buchi Labortechnik AG CH-
9230, Flawil, Switzerland) as described in section 2.6. 
3.2.3 Statistical analysis 
Data for DM, CP, ash, NDF, NH3-N and pH were evaluated by ANOVA in a 
factorial plus control design using Genstat Release 18 (VSN International Ltd). 
Treatment degrees of freedom were split into main effects of forage (Silage), 
tannin (Tannin), tannin inclusion rate (Level) and their interactions (Silage x 
Tannin, Silage x Level, Tannin x Level, and Silage x Tannin x Level). In all cases, 
data were checked for normality and homogeneity of variance by visual 
assessment of the residual plots. No adjustments were required and data are 
presented as means with an s.e.d of the means. 
3.3 Results 
The interaction between silage, tannin and level of tannin did not have an effect (P 
> 0.05) on mean DM, ash, NDF, pH or NH3-N (Table 14a, b & c). However, there 
was a silage, tannin and level of tannin interaction (P < 0.001) between these 
variables with regards to crude protein content that averaged 191, 175, 106, 162 
and 192 g/kg for grass, lucerne, red clover, red pea and white pea silage, 
respectively.  
Type of silage had an effect (P < 0.001) on the DM content which was highest in 
red pea silage and lowest in lucerne silage with grass, red clover and white pea 
silage being intermediate. Tannin type had no effect (P > 0.05) on DM content with 
silage treated with condensed and hydrolysable tannin having a similar dry matter 
content which averaged 356 g/kg. Dry matter content increased (P < 0.001) when 
the inclusion rate of tannin increased from 0 to 75 g/kg DM. There was an 
interaction between silage and tannin type with DM content being higher (P < 
0.001) when condensed tannin was added to grass and red clover silage, and 
when hydrolysable tannin was added to lucerne and red pea silage. For white pea 
silage, DM content was similar when condensed or hydrolysable tannin was added 
but higher than the untreated silage. There was no interaction (P > 0.05) between 
silage type and level of tannin on DM content (Figure 9 and Table 14).

3.4 Discussion 
This was the first study to investigate the addition of different inclusion rates of 
condensed and hydrolysable tannins at ensiling to grass, lucerne, red clover, red 
pea and white pea silages. The effects on the fermentation and nutritional value 
post ensiling were compared when tannins were added to the silage. The DM 
content of all the forages in the current study had a range between 281  387 g/kg, 
with red pea silage having the highest DM and lucerne silage the lowest. The DM 
content of the white pea silage was consistent with Sinclair et al. (2009), however, 
the red pea silage in the current study had a DM content that was 49 g/kg higher 
than Sinclair et al. (2009). In contrast, Hart et al. (2011) reported a lower and 
similar DM contents for both silages compared to the current study and Sinclair et 
al. (2009). Differences in DM content of pea silages may reflect the different 
species of pea silage used in the studies and the length of the wilting period. In 
both Sinclair et al. (2009) and Hart et al. (2011), the pea species Croma (white 
flowers) and Racer (coloured flowers) were used, whereas in the current study 
Montara (white flowers) and Daytona (coloured flowers) were used. Wilting period 
may have influenced the differences in DM content observed between the three 
studies, in the current study and Sinclair et al. (2009) both pea silages were wilted 
for 30 hours whereas in Hart et al. (2011) pea silages were wilted for 36 hours. 
Weather conditions at the time of wilting and harvesting may have influenced the 
DM content, however this was not recorded in the current study, or Sinclair et al., 
(2009) or Hart et al., (2011). 
The grass and red clover silages had DM contents that were similar to Dewhurst et 
al. (2003). In the current study, lucerne had a DM content that was considerably 
lower than values reported in previous studies (Dewhurst et al., 2003; Sinclair et 
al., 2015; Aguerre et al., 2016; Broderick et al., 2017). Hoffman et al. (1997) used 
first cut lucerne silage and wilted for 36 hours and reported a similar DM content to 
the current study. This similarity of DM content between studies may reflect the cut 
of silage and wilting time. In the current study, lucerne was first cut with a wilting 
time of 24 hours whereas in the previous studies (Dewhurst et al., 2003; Sinclair et 
al., 2015; Broderick et al., 2017), the silages were a mixture of cuts (1st to 4th cut) 
and had a range of wilting times between 24 and 48 hours. Wilting time is 
important for the removal of water from the silage prior to ensiling to increase the 
DM content (Wilkinson, 2005). 
Dry matter content of the silages used in the current study increased as the 
inclusion rate of tannin increased. Similarly, Deaville et al. (2010) observed an 
increase in DM content of grass silage when condensed and hydrolysable tannins 
were added at ensiling at a rate of 75 g/kg DM. These changes in DM content of 
silage may reflect the high DM content of the tannins.  In contrast, Tabacco et al. 
(2006) reported no difference in DM content when hydrolysable tannins were 
added at varying inclusion rates from 0 to 60 g/kg DM to lucerne silage at ensiling. 
In the current study, grass and red clover silage DM was higher when condensed 
tannins were added, and lucerne and red pea silage DM was higher when 
hydrolysable tannins were added, whereas white pea silage was unaffected. In 
contrast, Deaville et al. (2010) observed no differences in DM content when 
condensed or hydrolysable tannin were added to grass silage at ensiling. The 
differences observed in the current study also may reflect the different DM 
contents of the silage before either type of tannin was added to the silage.  
The CP content of the five forages used in the current study varied between 106 
and 192 g/kg DM, with red clover silage having the lowest and white pea silage the 
highest CP content. The grass silage used in the current study had a particular 
high CP content compared to previous studies, (Dewhurst et al., 2003; Sinclair et 
al., 2015; Vanhatalo et al., 2009) who reported values of between 111 and 140 
g/kg DM, which is approximately 79 g/kg DM lower than that observed by the 
current study. In the current study, the grass silage was predominantly ryegrass 
however it did contain some white clover which has a higher CP content 
(Dewhurst et al., 2003) so could influence the CP content of the grass silage. In a 
study conducted by Dewhurst et al. (2003), it was found that the CP content of 
white clover silage ranged from 212 to 261 g/kg DM, whilst grass silage ranged 
from 139 to 140 g/kg DM showing the difference in CP content between these 
silages. When grass and white clover silage were mixed as a 50:50 (DM basis), 
the CP content was 183 g/kg DM showing how the high CP content of white clover 
silage influenced the overall CP content of the mixed silage (Dewhurst et al., 
2003). Therefore, it can be concluded that the presence of white clover in the 
grass silage of the current study was influencing the overall CP content. 
The CP content of the red clover silage used in the current study is lower than 
values reported in some previous studies (Halmemies-Beauchet-Filleau et al., 
2014; Moorby et al., 2009; Hymes-Fecht et al., 2013). Values reported in previous 
studies fell in a range between 181 and 200 g/kg DM, which is up to 94 g/kg DM 
higher than the CP content of the red clover silage used in the current study. 
Forage legumes tend to have a delicate leaf in comparison to grasses, therefore 
leaf shatter can occur if the forage becomes too dry during the wilting process and 
the leaves shatter during harvesting (Wilkinson, 2005). Leaf shatter in red clover 
can reduce the CP content of red clover silage (Wilkinson, 2005) and therefore, in 
the current study, the low CP content may be due to leaf shatter occurring. The 
high NDF content of the red clover silage may indicate the maturity of the plant, it 
was found by (Vanhatalo et al., 2009) that NDF content of red clover silage 
increased from 375 to 463 g.kg DM as the age of the plant increased. Therefore, it 
can be suggested that the red clover used in the current study was an older plant 
than previous studies. Lucerne silage in the current study had CP content values 
were comparable to previous studies by Sinclair et al. (2015) and Hoffman et al. 
(1997) whereas the pea silages had CP content that was consistent with Mustafa 
et al. (2002). In contrast, Sinclair et al. (2009) and Hart et al. (2011) reported 
higher CP values in the red pea silage than the white pea silages which was in 
contrast to the current study.  
There was no significant effect of tannin type or rate of inclusion on CP content of 
the silages in the current study. Similarly, Tabacco et al. (2006) reported no effect 
of increasing hydrolysable tannin in lucerne silage on total N content. Deaville et 
al. (2010) also reported no change in N content when grass was supplemented 
with either condensed or hydrolysable tannins at 75 g/kg DM. In the silo, 
condensed and hydrolysable tannins have the ability to bind with proteins to form a 
tannin-protein complex, this binding occurs when pH is between pH 4.5  7.0 
(Salawu et al., 1999). The tannins provide protection of the protein from the 
extensive proteolysis that occurs in forage legumes during the ensiling process. 
Due to the lack of change in CP content with the addition of tannins to the silages 
at ensiling, in the current study, this would suggest that the tannins did not 
influence proteolysis in the silages. It can be concluded from these studies and the 
current study that tannins contain little N, and therefore the inclusion of either 
condensed or hydrolysable tannin does not significantly alter the CP content of 
silages.   
There was an effect of silage source on ash content with red pea silage having the 
highest value at 233 g/kg DM, and red clover silage the lowest at 74.4 g/kg DM. 
Ash content of lucerne silage was comparable to Sinclair et al. (2015), whilst the 
grass silage used in the current study was higher by 35 g/kg DM. Halmemies-
Beauchet-Filleau et al. (2014) and Broderick et al. (2000) reported similar ash 
contents of red clover silage with a mean value of 105 g/kg DM, which was 30.6 
g/kg DM higher than the current study. The ash content of both pea silages were 
higher than values reported by Mustafa et al. (2002), and may reflect the different 
varieties used between studies. In the current study, Montara (white flowers) and 
Daytona (coloured flowers) were used whereas Mustafa et al. (2002) used three 
varieties, Lenca, Carneval and Delta. The inclusion of tannin increased the ash 
content between 0 and 25 g/kg DM, however there was a decrease in ash content 
from 25 to 75 g/kg DM of tannin inclusion. Ash content was not significantly 
affected by the type of tannin, which was consistent with the observations by 
Deaville et al. (2010) when condensed or hydrolysable tannin was added to 
lucerne silage at a rate of 75 g/kg DM.  
Silage source had an effect on the NDF content in the current study, with values 
ranging from 397 to 610 g/kg DM. The NDF content of the pea silages were higher 
than that reported by Hart et al. (2011) and Sinclair et al. (2009). Different varieties 
of plant depend on different structures to remain upright, with the varieties used in 
the current study using the stem and therefore having a higher fibre level than pea 
varieties used by Hart et al. (2011) and Sinclair et al. (2009) that relied upon the 
tendrils to become tangled (Hart et al., 2011). However, the NDF values observed 
in the current study are comparable to Fraser et al. (2001). The fibre content of the 
grass silage used was similar to previous studies (Vanhatalo et al., 2009; 
Dewhurst et al., 2003), whereas the fibre levels of lucerne and red clover silage 
were higher in the current study than previous studies (Broderick et al., 2000; 
Broderick et al., 2001; Hymes-Fecht et al., 2013). Tannin type and rate of inclusion 
had no significant effect on the fibre content of the silages.  
The pH of the five silages used in the current study ranged between pH 4.5 and 
pH 6.1, with red clover, white pea and grass silages having a pH below 5 which 
would suggest that these silages were well fermented and preserved. However, 
lucerne and red pea silage had a pH above pH 5 which would suggest these 
silages had poorer fermentation therefore poor preservation. However, pH was not 
measured at the start of ensiling or over the course of ensiling so it is unclear 
when the silages reached these pH levels or how quickly the decline in pH 
occurred.  In contrast, Hart et al. (2011) and Sinclair et al. (2009) observed pH 
similar values for white pea and red pea silages which were in the range of pH 3.8 
to 4.1. Mustafa et al. (2002) concluded that the optimal pH range for successful 
prevention of proteolysis in pea silage was between pH 4.5 and pH 5.9, and in the 
current study, white pea silage fell within the range at pH 4.6, however the red pea 
silage was slightly outwith the range at pH 6.1. Red clover silage pH values were 
comparable with Hoffman et al. (1997) and Broderick et al. (2000) indicating the 
silage was well preserved. In contrast, the lucerne silage in the current study was 
higher than that observed by previous studies (Hoffman et al., 1997; Broderick et 
al., 2000; Sinclair et al., 2015) potentially indicating poorer fermentation occurred 
in the present study. Grass silage in the current study had a slightly higher pH than 
that reported in previous studies (Vanhatalo et al., 2009; Dewhurst et al., 2003; 
Moorby et al., 2009), however the pH was below pH 5 therefore indicating that 
successful prevention of proteolysis had occurred and the silage was well 
preserved.  
In the current study, forage pH was affected by the type of tannin, with silage that 
had been supplemented with condensed tannin having a higher pH than silage 
supplemented with hydrolysable tannin. In contrast, Deaville et al. (2010) reported 
no difference in forage pH when condensed or hydrolysable tannin was added to 
grass silage at ensiling. The difference observed in pH between condensed and 
hydrolysable tannin may reflect the different sources of silage used in the current 
study. Forage pH was not affected by inclusion rate of tannins in the current study, 
in contrast Tabacco et al. (2006) observed a decrease in pH when hydrolysable 
tannin supplemented lucerne silage at 20 g/kg DM. In silage that contained 10 
g/kg DM tannin, lactic acid content was higher and acetic acid content was lower 
than the other inclusion rates. However, when hydrolysable tannin was included at 
0, 40 and 60 g/kg DM there was no difference in the lucerne pH in the study of 
Tabacco et al. (2006). 
Ammonia nitrogen content varied between the five silages and ranged from 26.0 to 
177.8 g/kg TN, with red clover silage having the lowest and lucerne silage the 
highest. Both Hart et al. (2011) and Sinclair et al. (2009) reported ammonia 
nitrogen values that were higher by 22 and 62 g/kg TN for red pea and white pea 
silage, respectively, compared to the current study. Similar to the current study, 
Broderick et al. (2000) and Hymes-Fecht et al. (2013) reported that red clover 
silage had a lower ammonia nitrogen content than lucerne silage. However, in the 
current study, there was a 151 g/kg TN difference between red clover and lucerne 
silage whereas, in the previous studies (Broderick et al., 2000; Hymes-Fecht et al., 
2013) there was a smaller difference of 22.1 g/kg TN. These lower values for red 
clover silage may be due to the presence of PPO which binds with the protein, 
protecting the protein for proteolysis.  For grass silage, the ammonia nitrogen 
content in the current study was comparable but slightly lower by 10 g/kg TN to 
Vanhatalo et al. (2009). Further measurements that could be conducted on the 
silages to assess quality and preservation would be fermentation acids, lactic, 
acetic, propionic and butyric acids. Hymes-Fecht et al. (2013) observed higher 
levels of lactic acid in red clover silage at 7.27 g/kg DM compared with 5.83 g/kg 
DM in lucerne silage, whereas acetic acid was higher in lucerne silage by 0.89 
g/kg DM. Hymes-Fecht et al. (2013) suggested that lactic acid is important for 
influencing the final pH of silage and therefore quality, whilst acetic acid influences 
the aerobic stability of the silage. Therefore, further work is required to investigate 
the quality and preservation of these forage legumes with the determination of 
fermentation acids.  
Tannin type and rate of inclusion of tannin supplemented to the silages had no 
significant effect on the ammonia nitrogen content. Similarly, Deaville et al. (2010) 
reported no change in ammonia nitrogen when condensed and hydrolysable 
tannins were added to grass silage at a rate of 75 g/kg DM. In contrast, Tabacco 
et al. (2006) reported a decrease in ammonia nitrogen as hydrolysable tannin 
increased from 0 to 60 g/kg DM in lucerne silage. Variety of lucerne may have 
influenced the difference in ammonia nitrogen, with Daisy used in the current study 
and Equipe used in Tabacco et al. (2006). The extent of proteolysis that occurs in 
the silo influences the NPN levels which will impact the ammonia nitrogen levels, 
and different varieties undergo varying amounts of proteolysis. The results from 
the current study would suggest that neither the condensed or hydrolysable 
tannins at the varying levels were binding with the protein in the forage to form 
tannin-protein complexes, therefore there was no influence on the proteolysis 
within the silo.  
3.5 Conclusions 
The results in the present study show that forage source influences chemical 
composition following ensiling. The inclusion of either condensed or hydrolysable 
tannin did not influence DM, CP, ash, NDF or ammonia nitrogen content of the 
silage. However silages supplemented with condensed tannins had a higher 
forage pH than silages supplemented with hydrolysable tannins. Dry matter 
content of the silages increased with the inclusion rate of tannin from 0 to 75 g/kg 
DM while ash content increased from 0 to 25 g/kg DM, but then decreased as the 
inclusion of tannin increased. Crude protein, NDF, pH and ammonia nitrogen were 
unaffected by the inclusion rate of tannin. Therefore, the use of tannins as an 
additive at ensiling may not improve the utilisation of N from home grown forage 
legumes as the tannins did not provide protection to the protein so the amount of 
RUP available in the forages will not have been improved.  
Chapter 4  Experiment 2: Effect of forage pea silages on performance 
of high yielding dairy cows 
4.1 Background 
Within forage legumes, peas (Pisium sativum) are of particular interest due to their 
high protein content, with values of between 170 to 220 g/kg DM being reported 
(Mustafa et al., 2000; Hart et al., 2011). In Experiment 1, the forage pea silages 
indicated high crude protein values of 162 and 192 g/kg DM for red pea and white 
pea silage, respectively. Forage legumes can complement the lower protein levels 
found in cereal based forages such as maize or whole-crop wheat silages (Sinclair 
et al., 2009). Wheat has a high degradability of protein and starch within the rumen 
and legumes are thought to be able to complement wheat by improving N 
retention and milk performance of cows (Salawu et al., 2002b). Adesogan et al. 
(2004) found that the inclusion of a pea-wheat intercrop increased the levels of 
odd chain fatty acids in milk of dairy cows, indicating improvement of microbial 
synthesis within the rumen. In a study conducted by Salawu et al. (2002b), 
polyunsaturated fatty acids in the milk of dairy cows were lower when fed a pea-
wheat intercrop silage compared to grass silage, however the effect of a pure pea 
silage on milk fatty acid composition is unknown.  
Protein in forage legumes, like forage peas, is rapidly degraded within the rumen, 
resulting in poor utilisation and low rumen undegradable (by-pass) protein 
available in the small intestine (Sinclair et al., 2009).  Wastage of nitrogen by the 
dairy cow can be reduced by improving the efficiency of protein utilisation 
particularly by reducing rumen degradability (Bach et al., 2005). Additionally, high 
yielding dairy cows have a greater requirement for rumen undegradable protein to 
meet their requirements than lower yielding animals (McDonald et al., 2011).  
Tannins are defined as any phenolic compound of high molecular weight 
containing reactive phenolic hydroxyl or carboxyl groups that enable them to 
complex with protein, minerals and other macromolecules (Reed, 1995). Tannins 
can be classified as either condensed or hydrolysable with each being found in 
different plants (Scalbert, 1991). Protein from forages bind to tannins to form a 
complex; these complexes are pH dependent (Aerts et al., 1999) and in ruminants 
this binding occurs in the rumen at pH 4.5  7.0, normal rumen pH is 6.5  7.0 
(McMahon et al., 2000). These tannin-protein complexes can enable the protection 
of the protein from microbial attack, and dissociate at pH 2  3 found in the 
abomasum allowing the protein to reach the small intestine where absorption 
occurs (Fraser et al., 2001). In some cases, if the protein is covalently bound to 
the condensed tannin, this complex may not separate and will pass out in the 
faeces reducing the degradability of the protein (McMahon et al., 2000). It is 
therefore possible to alter protein degradability, in the rumen by adding tannins to 
the forage crop either at ensiling or feed-out. Condensed tannins that are found 
naturally within the vacuoles and epidermis of the leaves in certain legumes, such 
as forage peas, offer a practical and easy way of reducing the rumen degradability 
of protein found in legumes. 
Previous studies that have investigated the effect of condensed tannins on animal 
performance have focussed on growing lambs or lower yielding dairy cows in late 
lactation (Hart et al., 2011; Sinclair et al., 2009). In contrast, higher yielding dairy 
cows have a greater requirement of by-pass protein (Thomas, 2002) and therefore 
the benefits of condensed tannins in forage peas may be more apparent. 
Following on from Experiment 1, the red and white pea silages containing naturally 
occurring condensed tannins and high CP content were used to investigate the 
effects of condensed tannins in high yielding dairy cows. The study objectives 
were to determine the effect of the inclusion of forage peas differing in their tannin 
content in the diet of high yielding dairy cows on performance, diet digestibility, 
milk fatty acid content and N efficiency (conversion of feed N to milk N). 
4.2 Materials and Methods 
Ethical approval for the current study was granted by Harper Adams University 
Ethics Committee, and all procedures involving animals were conducted in 
accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. 
4.2.1 Animals 
Fifteen multiparous Holstein-Friesian and three Brown Swiss cross dairy cows that 
were in early lactation 100  23 days in milk, yielding 44  2.3 kg of milk per day, 
weighing 638  30.4 kg and an average body condition score of 2.88  0.16 were 
used in a 3x3 Latin square design with 3 periods, each of 4 weeks duration. Cows 
were blocked and allocated to one of three treatments according to breed, and 
milk yield in the week prior to the study. The three Brown Swiss cross dairy cows 
were allocated first to ensure each treatment had one Brown Swiss cross dairy 
cow. Following that allocation, the Holstein-Friesian dairy cows were allocated by 
milk yield. The experiment began on 9th February 2015 and cows remained on 
study for 12 weeks. 
4.2.2 Forages 
In spring 2014, two 1 ha plots of forage peas silages were established. The field 
was ploughed, sub-soiled and harrowed prior to drilling. Two varieties of pea, 
Daytona, red flower and Montara, white flower, were sown at approximately 240 
kg/ha in accordance with the breeders specification in mid-April using a pneumatic 
seed drill. Daytona is a high tannin coloured pea variety while Montara is a low 
tannin white pea variety (Wang et al., 1998). Both pea crops received cyanazine 
and pendimethalin herbicides at pre-emergence. Post emergence, a mixture of 
cyanazine and MCPA and MCPB herbicides were applied along with the 
insecticide cypermethrin. 
Both pea silages were mown at approximately 10:00 h on the 3rd July 2014 when 
the crop had reached growth stage 206 when pods are swollen with seeds (Knott, 
1987). A front mounted drum mower without a conditioner was used and a stubble 
of 10 cm was left. The peas were wilted for approximately 30 hours prior to being 
picked up by a precision chop, self-propelled forage harvester and ensiled in a 
roofed, concrete clamp with an additive (Axcool Gold, Biotal Ltd, Pontprenna, 
Cardiff; 4 l/tonne; Axcool Gold is an inoculant containing the bacteria L. buchneri  
40788). Clamps were filled quickly, rolled well and sealed with 2 separate sheets. 
Both clamps were weighed down with large straw bales. The grass silage was a 
second cut ley of predominantly rye grass and white clover, wilted for 
approximately 24 hours and harvested on 25th June 2014 using a precision chop, 
self-propelled forage harvester, and ensiled in a roofed, concrete clamp with 
additive (Axcool Gold, Biotal Ltd, Pontprenna, Cardiff; 4 l/tonne). The maize silage 
was harvested using a precision chop, self-propelled forage harvester in October 
2014 at approximately 300 g DM/kg and was ensiled in a concrete clamp without 
an additive.  
4.2.3 Diets 
Cows were allocated to one of three dietary treatments for each of the 3 periods of 
4 weeks duration. Each four week period included 21 days of adaption and 7 days 
of sampling. Dietary treatments were composed of 55:45 forage to concentrates 
(DM basis) and the forage proportions varied on a DM basis as follows: 
Control (C):             34:66 grass to maize silage 
 White pea (W):  34:66 white pea to maize silage 
 Red pea (R):            34:66 red pea to maize silage  
All diets had maize silage included to represent the diets fed to commercial UK 
dairy cow herds. All diets were formulated to be isonitrogenous and isoenergetic 
and to produce approximately 40 kg of milk per day according to Thomas, (2004). 
All diets were fed as a total mixed ration (TMR; Table 15), with the forages and 
concentrates mixed using a Hi-Spec MixMax 10 diet forage mixer (Hi-Spec 
Engineering Ltd, County Carlow, Ireland) calibrated to 1 kg. The diets were fed 
through Insentec roughage intake feeders (RIC feeders, Insentec B.V., 
Marknesse, The Netherlands) calibrated to 0.1 kg (Sinclair et al., 2007). Cows 
were identified by a transponder collar and an automatic animal identification fitted 
to the feeders. Each diet was offered at the rate of 1.05 of ad libitum daily intake at 
0800 h, with refusals collected three times a week.

The sugar beet pulp/wheat mix and soya bean meal were purchased from S & C 
Feeds Ltd (Stone, Staffordshire). The protein mix and soya hulls were purchased 
from KW Feeds (Market Drayton, Shropshire). Megalac (protected fat) was 
purchased from Volac (KW Feeds, Market Drayton, Shropshire) and urea prills 
were purchased from YARA Rumisan (KW Feeds, Market Drayton, Shropshire). 
4.2.4 Housing 
All cows were housed in an area containing Super Comfort foam mat cubicles and 
cubicles were bedded with sawdust twice weekly, limed weekly and scraped 
automatically six times daily. All cows had continual access to water and were 
milked twice daily at approximately 0600 and 1600 h in a 40 point internal rotary 
parlour. 
4.2.5 Experimental Routine 
Forage samples were collected once a week; a sub-sample was oven dried at 
105C and the ratio of pea to maize silage and grass to maize silage adjusted 
according to produce the desired ratio. During the final week of each period, 
samples of each TMR and forage were collected daily, and stored at -20C for 
subsequent analysis.  
Milk yield was recorded twice daily during the final week of each period with 
samples collected on four occasions (twice in the morning and twice in the 
afternoon) for analysis of fat, protein and lactose. An additional two samples (once 
in the morning and once in the afternoon) were collected for milk FA analysis. 
Twelve cows were randomly allocated to blood sampling, including the three 
Brown Swiss cross dairy cows. Blood samples were collected from 12 cows (4 per 
treatment) from the jugular vein via venepuncture into vacutainer tubes containing 
EDTA and fluoride/potassium oxalate. Samples were collected over two days in 
the final week of each period at 07:00, 09:00, 11:00 and 13:00 h, placed on ice 
immediately prior to separation of the plasma via centrifuging at 1390 g for 10 
minutes at 4C. Plasma was stored at -20C until further analysis. 
During the final week of each period, faecal grab samples were collected 5 
consecutive days at 08:00 and 14:00 h to determine whole tract digestibility. 
Samples were frozen at -20C prior to bulking and subsequent analysis. All cows 
were body condition scored using the method by Ferguson et al (1994) and 
weighed at 10:30 h in the week prior to the start of the study, and on the final day 
of the final week. All cows were transitioned onto the next diet the following day 
after the final day of sampling week.   
4.2.6 Chemical analysis 
Forage and TMR samples during the sampling week were bulked between days 
for each period. Sub-samples were analysed for DM (943.01), crude protein 
(990.03), and ash (942.05) according to AOAC (2012) as described in chapter 2. 
The NDF content was determined according to Van Soest et al. (1991) as 
described in section 2.4. Crude protein was determined using a Leco FP-528 
(Leco Corporation, St Joseph, MI). Sub-samples of TMR were analysed for acid 
insoluble ash (Van Keulan and Young, 1977) as described in section 2.13. Forage 
sub-samples were analysed for pH.  Forage pH was determined using a method 
by MAFF (1986) where water extract of the silage was determined using a Jenway 
3505 pH meter (Bibby Scientific Limited, Staffordshire, UK) as described in section 
2.5. Tannin content of the pea forages were determined according to Makkar et al. 
(1993) as described in section 2.8. Forage and TMR FAs were determined 
according to Jenkins, (2010) as described in section 2.7. Forage samples were 
sent to Sciantec Analytical (Stockbridge Technology Centre, North Yorkshire, UK) 
for determination of fermentation acids, lactic, acetic, propionic and butyric acids. 
Milk samples were analysed for fat, protein and lactose on a Milkoscan minor 
spectrophotometer (Foss Ltd., Denmark) calibrated by the methods of AOAC, 
(2012). Milk FA extraction was conducted according to Feng et al. (2004), 
methylation of milk FA was conducted according to Chouinard et al. (1999) as 
described in section 2.11. The FAME in hexane were analysed using a Hewlett-
Packard 6890 gas chromatograph (GC) fitted with a 100m CP Sil 88 column as 
described by Lock et al. (2006). 
Blood samples were analysed for total protein (TP), urea, beta-hydroxybutryrate 
(BHB), glucose, albumin and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs). Blood samples 
were analysed on a Cobas-Mira Plus auto-analyser (ABX Diagnostics, 
Bedfordshire, UK). Kits used for analysis were TP, Ref TP245; UREA, Ref UR221; 
RANBUT, Ref RB1008; GLUC-HK, Ref GU611; ALBUMIN, Ref AB362; and NEFA, 
Ref FA115.  
Faecal samples were bulked between days and sampling times (AM and PM) for 
each period and analysed for DM, OM and acid insoluble ash (Van Keulan and 
Young, 1977). Nitrogen and protein content were determined using a Leco FP-528 
(Leco Corporation, St Joseph, MI) according to AOAC (2012) (990.03) and NDF 
was determined according to Van Soest et al. (1991). 
The in situ residues of the forages were analysed for DM and CP as described in 
Chapter 2 materials and methods, sections 2.1 and 2.2, respectively. Crude 
protein being determined using a Leco FP-528 (Leco Corporation, St Joseph, MI).  
4.2.7 Statistical analysis 
All data were analysed within GenStat Release 18 (VSN International Ltd). Data 
for milk yield, body weight, body condition score and faecal parameters were 
evaluated by ANOVA as a Latin square design. Data for blood metabolites were 
analysed using repeated measures ANOVA. In all cases, data were checked for 
normality and homogeneity of variance by visual assessment of the residual plots. 
No adjustments were required. Data are presented as means with an s.e.d, with 
post hoc analysis using Tukeys test at a 5% level of significance. 
The kinetics of rumen DM and CP degradability were calculated from rskov and 
McDonald (1979) as: 
 p = a + b (1  e-ct) 
where p = potential degradability at time t, a = soluble fraction, b = potentially 
rumen degradable fraction, c = degradation rate of fraction b per hour and t = 
incubation time (h). Effective degradability was calculated from rskov and 
McDonald, (1979) using the following equation: 
 ED = a + (b*c)/(c+k) 
where k = rumen outflow rate of 0.08 h-1. Data were analysed using GenStat 18 
(VSN International Ltd, Oxford, UK). 
4.3 Results 
4.3.1 Feed Analysis 
The DM content of all four silages was above 300 g/kg, with white pea silage 
having the lowest DM while the red pea silage was 56 g/kg higher, with grass and 
maize silages being intermediate (Table 16). For both crude protein and ash 
content, the maize silage had the lowest and red pea silage had the highest 
content, while grass and white silage had intermediate values. Grass silage had 
the highest pH, while maize silage was 0.46 units lower. The mean NDF content 
was 432 g/kg DM, and was highest in grass silage and lowest in red pea silage. 
Tannin content was highest in white pea silage whilst red pea silage had a lower 
content. White pea and red pea silages had the highest ammonia nitrogen content 
with a mean value of 67.5 g/kg TN, and the grass and maize silages had the 
lowest ammonia nitrogen content with a mean value of 42.1 g/kg TN. 
Total fatty acid content of the silages was highest in grass silage and lowest in 
maize silage while white pea and red pea silages had intermediate values that had 
a mean value of 16.2 g/kg DM. White pea silage had the lowest content of C16:0 
fatty acid while grass silage had a content 1.21 g/kg DM higher, with maize and 
red pea silage being intermediates with a mean value of 2.10 g/kg DM. In contrast, 
C18:0 was highest in red pea silage, lowest in grass and maize silage with a mean 
value of 0.27 g/kg DM while white pea silage had an intermediate value. Maize 
silage had the highest content of fatty acid C18:1 c9, while white pea silage had 
the lowest content, with red pea and grass silages being intermediates with a 
mean value of 0.53 g/kg DM. Maize silage had the highest content of C18:2 c9 
c12, while white pea silage had the lowest content, with red pea and grass silage 
being intermediates with a mean value of 1.86 g/kg DM. In contrast, red pea and 
white pea silage had the same amount of C18:3 c9 c12 c15, while grass silage 
was higher and maize silage was lower.  
Lactic acid content was highest in red pea silage, maize silage had the lowest 
lactic acid content whilst grass and white pea silage were intermediates with a 
lactic acid content of a mean value of 75.1 g/kg. Maize silage had the lowest acetic 
acid content, and white pea silage had the highest content. Grass and red pea 
silage had intermediate acetic acid contents. Grass and white pea silage had 
intermediate values for propionic acid content, while maize silage had the highest 
propionic acid content and red pea silage had the lowest content. Butyric acid was 
highest in maize, white pea and red pea silage with a mean value of 0.2 g/kg while 
grass silage had a lower content.  
In the TMR, the diet containing the red pea silage (R) had the highest dry matter 
content with the diet containing white pea silage (W) had the lowest dry matter

4.3.4 Animal performance 
Total DM intake averaged 20.8 kg/day and was lower (P = 0.002) in cows fed W 
than C, with R being intermediate (Table 20). Milk yield averaged 39.0 kg/day and 
was highest (P = 0.005) in cows when fed the C diet than W or R diets, which did 
not differ. There were no dietary effects (P > 0.05) on milk fat content which 
averaged 38.3 g/kg, but diet had an effect (P = 0.045) on milk protein content 
which was highest in cows fed C diet and lowest in cows fed R diet. Milk lactose 
content averaged 45.4 g/kg and was lowest (P = 0.026) in cows when fed C diet. 
Mean liveweight was 642 kg and was higher in the C diet (P = 0.026) than W diet, 
with R diet being intermediate. In contrast, dietary treatment had no effect (P > 
0.05) on body condition score or live weight change which averaged 2.87 and 0.28 
kg/day respectively. Diet had a minor effect on N efficiency which was slightly 
lower in cows fed W diet and higher in cows fed C and R diets.

(Table 21). In contrast, C16:0 was higher (P = 0.006) in cows when fed W diet 
whereas C17:0 was highest in cows when fed either W or R diets. Cows fed C diet 
had the highest proportion of C18:2 n-6 (P < 0.001) and C20:3 n-3 (P = 0.049) 
whilst C18:3 n-3 was higher (P = 0.001) in cows when fed R diet whilst cows fed C 
and W diets had a similar content. Diet had no effect on FA with chain lengths of 
less than or greater than C16. Saturated, MUFA and PUFA fatty acids were also 
not affected by diet (P > 0.05). Fatty acids of chain C16:0 and C16:1 were higher 
(P = 0.005) in cows when receiving the diet containing white pea silage.

Dry matter intake was highest (P = 0.002) in cows when fed C diet and lowest in W 
diet with cows receiving R diet having an intermediate intake (Table 24). There 
was no dietary effect on faecal DM output and similarly, DM digestibility was 
unaffected (P > 0.05) by diet. Organic matter intake was lowest (P = 0.001) in 
cows when receiving W diet and highest when receiving C diet. There was no 
effect of diet (P > 0.05) on faecal OM digestibility or output. Nitrogen intake was 
affected (P = 0.001) by diet being 39 g/d higher in cows when fed C diet. Diet had 
no effect (P > 0.05) on N faecal output or digestibility. Intake of NDF was highest 
(P < 0.001) in cows fed C diet and lowest in cows receiving the W diet. In contrast, 
neither faecal NDF digestibility nor output was affected by diet (P > 0.05).

4.4 Discussion 
4.4.1 Feed analysis  
To the authors knowledge this is the first study to investigate the replacement of 
grass silage with white or red pea silage in maize silage based diets as dietary 
treatments to compare effects on dairy cow performance, milk quality and 
apparent digestibility in high yielding cows. The pea varieties in the current study, 
Daytona and Montara, were selected for their condensed tannin content based on 
their flower colour. Peas with coloured flowers contain high condensed tannin 
content while peas with white flowers contain low condensed tannin pea content 
(Wang et al., 1998). The peas were harvested, after a wilting period of 
approximately 30 hours, at growth stage 206 (Knott, 1987). Fraser et al. (2001) 
concluded that it was important that peas were harvested before lodging occurred 
in the crop, and that growth stage 206 gave the highest DM and CP yield. Both 
pea silages had a similar chemical composition; however the red pea silage had a 
higher DM content than the white pea silage. The DM content of the forage peas in 
the current study differed to a previous study by Sinclair et al. (2009) in which DM 
content was 32 g/kg higher in white pea silage which may reflect the different 
varieties of peas used. The CP content of the pea silages used in the current study 
were slightly higher than observed in Sinclair et al. (2009). Crude protein content 
of grass silage in the current study was considerably higher than reported for 
grass silages in the UK (Yan and Agnew, 2004). The difference in CP content of 
grass silage in the current study and Sinclair et al. (2015) may be attributed to the 
stage of harvest as the current study; the grass silage was harvested from a 
second cut ley of predominantly ryegrass compared to a first cut in Sinclair et al. 
(2015). A second possibility for the high crude protein content of the grass silage 
was the ley contained white clover which generally has a CP content of between 
210 to 260 g/kg DM (Dewhurst et al., 2003), therefore increasing the overall CP 
content of the grass silage.  In contrast, the CP content of the grass silage was 
comparable to Moorby et al. (2009), although it is unclear whether the ryegrass 
sward was first or second cut. Generally, all silages were well preserved and 
fermented with lactic acid content above 40 g/kg. The maize silage had a very low 
lactic acid content, although the acetic, propionic and butyric acid levels were all 
below 2 g/kg DM indicating that the silage was well preserved. Similarly, Sinclair et 
al. (2015) reported a low lactic acid content of 19 g/kg DM and concentrations of 
less than 5 g/kg DM for the other fermentation acids. The tannin content of the 
forage peas in the current study differed to previous studies by Hart et al. (2011) 
and Sinclair et al. (2009) in which tannin content was 45.4 g/kg DM higher in red 
pea silage, this may reflect the different varieties of peas. However, these 
differences may reflect the sensitivity of the method as there was an intra-assay 
CV of 7.1% indicating a small presence of variation between the samples. 
Therefore, the forage pea silages in the current study, had similar levels of 
condensed tannins which does not adhere to the expected tannin levels present 
with different flower colours.  
4.4.2 Degradation characteristics 
Dietary treatment had an effect on the soluble DM and CP fraction (a) where red 
pea silage had lower content than grass and white pea silage. In contrast, Mustafa 
et al. (2000) reported that Grande pea silage had a higher soluble DM fraction 
than lucerne and barley silage however the soluble CP fraction was similar for all 
three silages. The potential (b) degradable CP fraction was highest in red pea 
silage whereas rate of degradation was faster in grass silage. In contrast, Sinclair 
et al. (2009) observed a higher potential degradable N fraction in grass silage with 
red pea silage having the lowest content. Sinclair et al. (2009) concluded that 
protein degradability in the rumen was reduced by the presence of condensed 
tannins that occur naturally within forage pea silage. Mustafa et al. (2000) reported 
that pea silage had a similar potential degradable CP fraction to lucerne silage but 
lower than barley silage. However, rate of degradation was similar for pea, lucerne 
and barley silage suggesting that protein in pea silage is degraded at the same 
rate as lucerne and barley silage in the rumen. Although, in the current study, 
protein was degraded the quickest in grass silage, therefore suggesting that the 
condensed tannins in the pea silage slowed the rate of protein degradation in the 
rumen. Effective CP degradability, in the current study, was highest in white pea 
silage which was in agreement with Sinclair et al. (2009). 
4.4.3 Animal performance 
Neither the white nor red pea silage TMR improved DM intake of mid-lactation 
cows, with cows fed the grass silage having the highest DM intake. All silages 
were fed as a mixture with maize silage and concentrates. In previous studies, 
(Adesogan et al., 2004; Salawu et al., 2002b), pea-wheat silages have been 
reported to improve DM intake compared to feeding grass silage as the only silage 
in a TMR diet. Similarly, Mustafa et al. (2000), reported an improvement in DM 
intake of cows when pea silage replaced barley silage in a TMR based diet. The 
difference in intake reported in the current study may be attributed to the 
differences seen in the CP content of the silages. Broderick, (2003) and Sinclair et 
al. (2015), reported that when dietary protein was increased that there was a 
similar improvement in DM intake.  
The increase in DM intake in cows when fed the grass silage was reflected in milk 
yield.  Cows fed white or red pea silage had a similar yield, however these were 
lower than cows when fed the grass silage. In previous studies (Salawu et al., 
2002b; Adesogan et al., 2004; Sinclair et al., 2009) milk yield was lower than in the 
current study which may reflect stage of lactation with days in milk averaging 66, 
77 and 194 days in milk, respectively. In contrast, Mustafa et al. (2000) reported 
similar milk yields to the current study and found no effect of pea silage on the milk 
yield of cows in early lactation. 
There was no significant effect of dietary treatment on milk fat content whereas 
milk protein content was higher in dairy cows when fed grass silage. Two studies 
(Salawu et al., 2002b; and Adesogan et al., 2004) fed pea-wheat bi-crops to dairy 
cows, milk fat content was lower in cows fed pea-wheat bi-crops compared to 
cows fed grass silage in Salawu et al. (2002b) study whereas Adesogan et al. 
(2004) reported no effects on milk fat content. The differences observed in these 
two studies may be attributed to the higher starch concentration and DM 
digestibility reported by Adesogan et al. (2004) compared to Salawu et al. (2002b). 
The increase in milk protein observed in cows fed grass silage in the current study 
may reflect the higher CP content observed; however the CP content was similar 
to the white and red pea silage diets. This response may suggest that more 
metabolisable protein was reaching the small intestine for digestion in cows fed 
grass silage. Mustafa et al. (2000) observed a higher milk fat content but a lower 
milk protein content in cows fed pea silage and concentrates in a 50:50 
forage:concentrate ratio. Unlike milk fat and protein content, milk lactose content 
was higher in cows when fed either of the pea silages compared to grass silage. 
The responses observed in milk composition in the current study, may have been 
different if the inclusion rate of pea silage had been higher. Nitrogen efficiency was 
slightly lower in cows fed white pea silage, although cows fed grass or red pea 
silage had the same N efficiency. Protein levels were balanced across all three 
treatments to be isonitrogenous, therefore there should be the same amount of N 
available at intake to be converted to milk N. However, in the current study, cows 
fed grass silage had a higher DMI, therefore N intake was higher in cows fed grass 
silage. Sinclair et al. (2009) observed slightly higher N efficiency in cows fed red 
pea silage; however, these differences between the pea silages were small, 
similar to the current study. N intake was similar for both pea silages averaging 
0.53 kg, although cows fed grass silage had a higher N efficiency than both pea 
silages but N intake was lower averaging 0.45 kg. From these studies, it can be 
concluded that N efficiency does not tend to be improved by the inclusion of white 
or red pea silage however N efficiency may be improved if the inclusion rate of pea 
silage in the diet was higher. 
4.4.4 Milk FA composition and blood metabolites 
Dietary treatment had no effect on the majority of the FAs, milk fat content in 
C16:0 was in higher concentrations in cows fed white pea silage, whereas C17:0 
was at similar concentration in cows fed white or red pea silages compared to the 
grass silage. Odd chain fatty acids are normally derived from de novo synthesis in 
the mammary glands; however this response of C17:0 was comparable with 
Adesogan et al. (2004) who suggested that microbial synthesis within the rumen 
may have been improved by inclusion of pea-wheat bi-crop silage. Therefore, in 
the current study, the presence of pea silage in the diet may have increased 
microbial synthesis in the rumen.  Although in the current study, FAs of chain 
length less than C16, indicating de novo synthesis in the mammary glands and 
more than C16, indicating uptake from the diet, were not affected by dietary 
treatment. This response would suggest that microbial synthesis was not 
increased in the rumen by the diet. The concentration of -linolenic acid (C18:3 n-
3) was highest in cows when fed the red pea silage. In contrast, Adesogan et al. 
(2004) found no effect of pea-wheat intercrop on milk concentration of -linolenic 
acid. Cows fed the grass silage had a higher concentration of C18:2 n-6 than cows 
fed the white or red silages.  
There was no effect of dietary treatment on blood metabolites in the current study 
except plasma urea, with cows fed white or red pea silage having higher levels 
which increased during the day. These increased urea values are comparable with 
Sinclair et al. (2009) and Salawu et al. (2002b) in which cows fed pea silage had 
higher urea values and indicate a greater rumen CP degradability. This would 
suggest that more nitrogen is leaving the rumen as ammonia which will be taken 
up by the blood to be transported to the liver to be converted into urea prior to 
excretion via urine (Broderick and Albrecht, 1997; Bach et al., 2005). Plasma 
NEFA is an indicator of energy status of the dairy cow (Cozzi et al., 2011), and in 
the current study plasma NEFA levels decreased post feeding, however there was 
no effect of dietary treatment. It is known that plasma NEFA levels can change 
according to feeding times (Topps and Thompson, 1984) and therefore sampling 
time can have an effect on NEFA levels, which is why, cows in the current study 
were sampled at varying times from feeding. Plasma BHB levels in the current 
study were below 0.9 mmol/l indicating that the cows had a positive energy 
balance and were past their peak in milk production (Topps and Thompson, 1984).  
4.4.5 Apparent whole-tract digestibility 
Digestibility of DM, OM, NDF and N were not affected by dietary treatment in the 
current study. Dschaak et al. (2011) observed no differences in DM, OM and NDF 
digestibility when supplementing the diet of dairy cows with quebracho condensed 
tannin extract at a rate of 3% DM. In contrast, Adesogan et al. (2004) observed a 
higher digestibility of DM and OM in cows fed pea-wheat intercrop compared to 
those fed grass silage. Adesogan et al. (2004) suggested this increase in 
digestibility was due to a rapid degradation of peas within the rumen. In the current 
study, DM and OM digestibility of both pea silages was similar to the grass silage 
suggesting that the pea silages degraded at the same rate as the grass silage in 
the rumen.  In intercrop silages, one crop will be harvested at the incorrect 
maturity stage due to the two crops maturing at different rates (Anil et al., 1998). In 
Adesogan et al. (2004) the crops were harvested at 14 weeks post sowing 
whereas in the present study, both whole crop peas were harvested at 12 weeks 
post sowing therefore the peas in Adesogan et al. (2004) study may have been 
harvested past the optimum maturity stage.  
4.5 Conclusion 
The results of the present study show that the total replacement of grass silage 
with white or red pea silage in a maize silage based TMR reduces dry matter 
intake, milk yield and had no effect on diet digestibility. The inclusion of white or 
red pea silage did not improve milk fat content or milk protein content compared to 
dairy cows fed grass silage. Plasma urea levels were increased by the inclusion of 
white and red pea silage. Nitrogen digestibility and intake were higher in dairy 
cows fed grass silage compared to dairy cows fed white or red pea silage. The 
soluble DM and CP fraction were lowest in red pea silage, and the potential CP 
degradable fraction was highest in red pea silage. The rate of degradation was 
fastest in grass silage and slowest in white pea silage. Effective degradability of 
protein was highest in white pea silage. Therefore, any commercial advantage 
from feeding forage peas to high yielding dairy cows will be based on savings in N 
from fertiliser or dietary protein. 
Chapter 5  Experiment 3: Effect of the addition of hydrolysable 
tannins to lucerne and red clover silages on the performance of high 
yielding dairy cows 
5.1 Background 
Similar to the forage peas used in Experiment 2, red clover and lucerne have a 
high protein content and have been used in previous studies as a source of protein 
for dairy cows. Studies in the United States comparing grass, lucerne, and red 
clover silages have reported that feeding lucerne silage increases DM intake, milk 
yield, milk fat and protein levels (Broderick et al. 2005), although relatively few 
studies have compared the forages directly. Broderick et al. (2000) compared 
lucerne and red clover silage as the sole forage fed with concentrates in a TMR for 
lactating dairy cows. It was observed that DM intake, milk yield and milk 
composition were all higher in cows that were fed lucerne silage. Although, feeding 
red clover silage improved body weight gain and apparent digestibility of DM, OM 
and NDF, N digestibility was higher in lucerne silage. However, Broderick et al. 
(2001) observed improved N efficiency and apparent digestibility of DM, OM and 
NDF when cows were fed red clover silage, although DM intake was the only 
performance factor to be increased by lucerne silage. Due to the lack of studies 
and varying results, it is therefore difficult to draw a conclusion about the direct 
effects of lucerne and red clover silage on the performance of high yielding dairy 
cows.  
Hydrolysable tannins have the ability to bind to proteins in the silo at pH 4.5  7.0 
and can reduce the extensive proteolysis of proteins that occurs (Salawu et al., 
1999). Therefore, protecting the protein in the silage and improving the amount of 
RUP available to the ruminant at feed out (Salawu et al., 1999). In Experiment 1 
(Chapter 3), the addition of hydrolysable tannin to lucerne and red clover silage at 
four inclusion levels had no influence on the crude protein content of silage. 
Therefore, it can be suggested from this experiment that the addition of 
hydrolysable tannins at ensiling to lucerne or red clover silage did not reduce the 
extent of proteolysis of protein during the ensiling process. Similar to condensed 
tannins, hydrolysable tannins will dissociate with the protein in the abomasum at 
pH 2.0  3.0 allowing the protein to be digested and absorbed across the small 
intestinal wall (Mueller-Harvey, 2006). Previous studies have investigated the 
effects of inclusion of hydrolysable tannins in a dairy cow diet however have 
yielded inconsistent results. Dschaak et al. (2011) reported a lower DM intake but 
no effect on milk yield when hydrolysable tannins were included in the diet of dairy 
cows at 30 g/kg DM. Similarly, Liu et al. (2013) observed no changes in DM intake 
or milk yield when hydrolysable tannin was included at 10 g/kg DM in a postpartum 
diet of a dairy cow. Previous studies that have investigated the effect of 
supplementation of condensed or hydrolysable tannins on animal performance 
have focussed on tannins being added to the diet at feed out (Dschaak et al., 
2011; Liu et al., 2013). In Experiment 2 (Chapter 4), the presence of naturally 
occurring condensed tannins in forage peas reduced DMI and milk yields in 
comparison to cows fed grass silage. However, overall cow performance was 
similar when fed either white or red pea silage suggesting the presence of 
condensed tannins during the ensiling process had no effect on animal 
performance. A few studies have compared lucerne and red clover silage on 
animal performance (Broderick et al., 2000; Broderick et al., 2001) but there is little 
information on the effects of lucerne and red clover silage supplemented with 
hydrolysable tannins at ensiling on animal performance therefore the benefits of 
hydrolysable tannins may be more apparent. Therefore, the study objectives were 
to determine the effects of lucerne and red clover silages with the addition of 
tannins at ensiling in the diet of high yielding dairy cows on performance, N 
efficiency, milk fatty acid content and diet digestibility.  
5.2 Materials and Methods 
Ethical approval for the current study was granted by Harper Adams University 
Ethics Committee, and all procedures involving animals were conducted in 
accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. 
5.2.1 Forages 
Lucerne (vr. Daisy) was harvested using a forage wagon on 1st July 2015, wilted 
for 48 hours and ensiled in two roofed, concrete clamp with an additive (Axcool 
Gold, Biotal, Cardiff, UK; 4l/t) or in mini-silos. The red clover (vr. Corvus) was 
harvested using a forage wagon on 21st July 2015, wilted for 48 hours and ensiled 
in two roofed, concrete clamp with an additive (Axcool Gold. Biotal, Cardiff, UK; 
4l/t) or in mini-silos. Chestnut hydrolysable tannins (Castanea sativa mill; Provit 
Sp. Zo. O., Poland) were added at ensiling to one clamp of lucerne and red clover 
silage at a rate of 25 g/kg DM. The rate of 25 g/kg DM was determined from a 
previous study conducted at Harper Adams University. It was observed that milk 
yield in Suffolk cross ewes was improved when hydrolysable tannin was added to 
lucerne silage at feed out at 25 g/kg DM compared to no supplementation (Taha, 
2015). However, Taha, 2015 observed reduced milk yields when hydrolysable 
tannins were included at higher rates of 50 or 75 g/kg DM, but DM intake was 
unaffected by inclusion of tannin. Hydrolysable tannin was mixed with water as a 
30% solution based on DM weight of each silage and added to the lucerne and red 
clover at ensiling. The same volume of water was added to the control clamps of 
lucerne and red clover forage. Either water or hydrolysable tannin solution were 
mixed with each forage in a Hi-Spec MixMax 10 forage mixer (Hi-Spec 
Engineering Ltd, County Carlow, Ireland) for 5 minutes. Following mixing, forages 
were added to their appropriate clamp. Maize (vr. Adept) was harvested in 
October 2015 using a self-propelled forage harvester at approximately 300 g/kg 
DM and ensiled in a concrete clamp without additive.  
5.2.2 Experiment 3a  Ensiling characteristics  
In Experiment 3a, mini silos were produced for the four forages described in 
section 5.2.1 to investigate the effect of the supplementation of hydrolysable 
tannins on DM, pH and NH3-N during the ensiling process from day 1 to 120. For 
all forages, the silos were opened on days 1, 4, 7, 10, 48, 90 and 120 days for DM 
and pH, whereas NH3-N analysis was completed on all forages for days 1, 4, 7, 
10, 48 and 120 days, day 90 was not analysed due to time constraints. Chemical 
composition (DM, CP, ash, NDF, pH & NH3-N) of the four forages was investigated 
in mini silos opened on day 120. 
5.2.2.1 Mini silo production 
Twenty eight mini silos were made for each of the four forages, lucerne (LCS), 
lucerne plus tannin (LTS), red clover (RCS) and red clover plus tannin (RTS) 
silage and were conserved in pipes of length 33 cm and diameter 14 cm attached 
to a wooden base lined with two plastic bags. Approximately 1 kg of fresh silage 
was placed in plastic bags and compressed. Bags were then sealed with silage 
tape, sand placed on top and the mini silo sealed with silage tape. Mini silos were 
stored at ambient temperature and opened at 1, 4, 7, 10, 48, 90 and 120 days 
following harvest. For each time point, four mini silos of each forage were opened 
and each silo was analysed to ensure adequate replication. Following opening, the 
mini silo samples were stored at -20C until subsequent analysis. 
5.2.2.2 Chemical analysis 
Mini silos opened on day 120 were analysed for DM (943.01), CP (990.03), and 
ash (942.05) according to AOAC, (2012) as described in chapter 2 and also for 
NDF content according to Van Soest et al. (1991), with pH determined according 
to MAFF, (1986) using a Jenway 3505 pH meter (Bibby Scientific Limited, 
Staffordshire, UK). Ammonia  nitrogens were determined on day 1, 4, 7, 48 and 
120 silos using a method adapted from MAFF, (1986) using an auto-titrator (FOSS 
1030 auto-titrator, FOSS, Warrington, UK and Buchi Labortechnik AG CH-9230, 
Flawil, Switzerland) as described in section 2.6. Dry matter content and pH were 
determined on the mini silo samples that were opened on days 1, 4, 7, 10, 48, 90 
and 120 days post-harvest. 
5.2.2.3 Statistical analysis 
All data were analysed using GenStat Release 18 (VSN International Ltd). Data for 
the ensiling parameters were evaluated by analysis of variance as a 2x2 factorial 
design. Treatment degrees of freedom were split into main effects of forage 
(forage), tannin (Tannin) and their interaction (F x T). Data for DM, pH and NH3-N 
of mini silos opened on day 1, 4, 7, 10, 48, 90 and 120 were analysed using 
repeated measures model. Treatment degrees of freedom were split into main 
effects of treatment (Treatment), day (Day) and their interactions (Treatment, 
Treatment x Day).  In all cases, data were checked for normality and homogeneity 
of variance and no adjustments were required. Data are presented as means and 
s.e.d of means.  
5.2.3 Experiment 3b  Performance of dairy cows fed lucerne and red clover 
silages 
In Experiment 3b, twelve high yielding dairy cows in early lactation were fed either 
lucerne, lucerne plus tannin, red clover or red clover plus tannin silage in a 4x4 
Latin square design over 16 weeks. Animal performance, diet digestibility, milk 
fatty acid content and N efficiency was investigated.  
5.2.3.1 Animals 
Twelve multiparous Holstein-Friesian dairy cows, which were in mid lactation (88  
26.9 days in milk; mean  standard error of difference), yielding 41  3.7 kg of milk 
per day, weighing 634  51.8 kg and body condition score of 2.9  0.16 at the 
beginning of the study were used. Cows were blocked and allocated to one of four 
treatments according to milk yield and days in milk in the week prior to the study. 
The experiment began on 11th January 2016 and cows remained on study for 16 
weeks. 
5.2.3.2 Diets 
Cows were allocated to one of four dietary treatments for each of four periods of 
four weeks. Each four week period included 21 days of adaptation and 7 days of 
sampling. Dietary treatments were composed of 55:45 forage to concentrates (DM 
basis) and the forage proportions varied on a DM basis as follows: 
Lucerne control (LC):  36:64 lucerne to maize silage 
 Lucerne + tannin (LT):  36:64 lucerne plus tannins to maize silage 
 Red clover control (RC): 36:64 red clover to maize silage 
 Red clover + tannin (RT): 36:64 red clover plus tannins to maize silage 
All diets were formulated to be isonitrogenous and isoenergetic to produce 
approximately 40 kg of milk per day according to Thomas, (2004). A Hi-Spec 
MixMax 10 diet forage mixer (Hi-Spec Engineering Ltd, County Carlow, Ireland) 
calibrated to 1 kg, was used to mix the forages and concentrates which were fed 
as a total mixed ration (TMR; Table 25). The diets were fed in Insentec roughage 
intake feeders (RIC feeders, Insentec B.V., Marknesse, The Netherlands) 
calibrated to 0.1 kg (Sinclair et al., 2007). Cows were identified by a transponder 
collar and an automatic animal identification fitted to the feeders. Each diet was 
offered at the rate of 1.05 of ad libitum daily at 0800 h, and refusals were collected 
three times a week. Following the final day of each sampling week, all cows were 
changed over onto their next diet for their next period. Diet change over did not 
involve a gradual change due to the diets being formulated to be isonitrogenous 
and isoenergetic with the only difference between the four diets being the type of 
experimental forage fed to the cows.

5.2.3.3 Housing 
Cows were housed in an area containing cubicles fitted with Super Comfort foam 
mats. Cubicles were bedded with sawdust twice weekly limed weekly. Automatic 
scrapers were used to scrape the cubicles on six occasions during the day.  All 
cows had continual access to water.  
5.2.3.4 Experimental routine  
Forage samples were collected once a week; a sub-sample was oven dried at 
105C and the ratio of lucerne to maize silage and red clover to maize silage 
adjusted to produce the desired ratio. During the final week of each period, 
samples of each TMR and forage were collected daily, and stored at -20C for 
subsequent analysis.  
All cows were milked twice daily at approximately 0600 and 1600 h in a 40 point 
internal rotary parlour. Milk yield was recorded at each milking during the final 
week of each period. Milk samples were collected on four occasions during the 
final week of each period (twice in the morning and twice in the afternoon) for 
analysis of fat, protein and lactose. Milk samples were also collected for milk fatty 
acid analysis on two occasions (once in the morning and once in the afternoon). 
Blood samples were collected from all 12 cows (3 per treatment) from the jugular 
vein via venepuncture into vacutainer tubes containing EDTA and 
fluoride/potassium oxalate. Samples were collected over two days in the final 
week of each period at 0700, 0900, 1100 and 1300 h, placed on ice immediately 
prior to separation of the plasma via centrifuging at 1390 g for 15 minutes at 4C. 
Plasma was stored at -20C until further analysis. 
During the final week of each period, faecal grab samples were collected on 5 
consecutive days at 0800 and 1400 h to determine whole tract digestibility. 
Samples were frozen at -20C prior to bulking and subsequent analysis. All cows 
were body condition scored using the method by Ferguson et al (1994) and 
weighed in the week prior to the start of the study, and on the final day of each 
period at 1100 h.   
5.2.3.5 Chemical analysis 
Forage and TMR samples during the sampling week were bulked between days 
for each period. Sub-samples of the forages and TMR were analysed for DM 
(943.01), crude protein (990.03), and ash (942.05) according to AOAC, (2012) as 
described in chapter 2. Sub-samples of TMR were analysed for acid insoluble ash 
(Van Keulan and Young, 1977). Forage sub-samples were analysed for pH as 
described in section 2.5. Crude protein was determined using a Leco FP-528 
(Leco Corporation, St Joseph, MI) and NDF content was determined according to 
van Soest et al. (1991). Forage pH was determined using a method by MAFF, 
(1986) where water extract of the silage was determined using a Jenway 3505 pH 
meter (Bibby Scientific Limited, Staffordshire, UK). Tannin content of the pea 
forages were determined according to Makkar et al. (1993) as described in section 
2.8. Forage and TMR FAs were determined according to Jenkins, (2010) as 
described in section 2.7. Forage samples were sent to Sciantec Analytical 
(Stockbridge Technology Centre, North Yorkshire, UK) for determination of 
fermentation acids, lactic, acetic, propionic and butyric acids. 
Milk samples were analysed for fat, protein and lactose on a Milkoscan minor 
spectrophotometer (Foss Ltd., Denmark) calibrated by the methods of AOAC, 
(2012). Milk FA extraction was conducted according to Feng et al. (2004), with 
methylation of FA conducted according to Chouinard et al. (1999) as described in 
section 2.11. The FAME in hexane were analysed using a Hewlett-Packard 6890 
gas chromatograph (GC) fitted with a 100m CP Sil 88 column as described by 
Lock et al. (2006). 
Blood samples were analysed for total protein (TP), urea, beta-hydroxybutryrate 
(BHB), glucose, and albumin. Blood samples were analysed on a Cobas-Mira Plus 
auto-analyser (ABX Diagnostics, Bedfordshire, UK). Kits used for analysis were 
TP, Ref TP245; UREA, Ref UR221; RANBUT, Ref RB1008; GLUC-HK, Ref 
GU611; and ALBUMIN, Ref AB362.  
Faecal samples were bulked between days and sampling times for each period. 
Samples were analysed for DM, OM, and acid insoluble ash (Van Keulan and 
Young, 1977). Nitrogen was determined using a Leco FP-528 (Leco Corporation, 
St Joseph, MI). 
In situ dry matter and crude protein degradation of the lucerne and red clover 
silages were determined as described in section 2.14. Crude protein was 
determined using a Leco FP-528 (Leco Corporation, St Joseph, MI).  
5.2.3.6 Statistical analysis 
All data were analysed using GenStat Release 18 (VSN International Ltd). All data 
for milk yield parameters, body weight, body condition score and faecal 
parameters were evaluated by analysis of variance as a 2x2 factorial design. 
Treatment degrees of freedom were split into main effects of forage (Forage), 
tannin (Tannin) and their interaction (F x T).  Data for blood metabolites were 
analysed using repeated measures model. Treatment degrees of freedom were 
split into main effects of diet (Treatment), time (Time) and their interactions 
(Treatment, Treatment x Time). In all cases, data were checked for normality and 
homogeneity of variance by assessment of the residual plots. No adjustments 
were required. Data are presented as means with an s.e.d, with post hoc analysis 
using Tukeys test at a 5% level of significance. 
The kinetics of rumen DM and CP degradability were calculated from rskov and 
McDonald, (1979) as: 
 p = a + b (1  e-ct) 
where p = potential degradability at time t, a = soluble fraction, b = potentially 
rumen degradable fraction, c = degradation rate of fraction b per hour and t = 
incubation time (h). Effective degradability was calculated from rskov and 
McDonald, (1979) using the following equation: 
 ED = a + (b*c)/(c+k) 
where k = rumen outflow rate of 0.08 h-1. Data was analysed using GenStat 18 
(VSN International Ltd, Oxford, UK).

5.3.2.2 Dry matter degradation characteristics 
The soluble DM fraction (a) was highest (P<0.001) in the lucerne silage and lowest 
in the red clover silage (Table 31 and Figure 26). Lucerne silage supplemented 
with tannin had a lower soluble DM fraction than lucerne silage without tannin. 
However, supplementation of tannin to the red clover silage had no effect on the 
soluble DM fraction.

Red clover silage had a higher (P < 0.001) potential degradable fraction (b) than 
lucerne silage. There was an interaction (P < 0.05) between forage source and 
tannin addition on the potentially degradable fraction, which was lower when 
tannin was added to red clover silage but not lucerne silage. The extent of DM 
degradation (a+b) was lowest (P < 0.001) in the red clover silage and highest in 
the lucerne silage. The inclusion of tannin reduced (P < 0.05) the extent of 
degradation in both the lucerne and red clover silages. Lucerne silage had a 
higher (P < 0.001) rate of degradation (c) than red clover silage. The addition of 
tannin to red clover and lucerne silage increased (P < 0.05) the rate of 
degradation. Effective degradability (ED) was highest (P < 0.001) in lucerne silage 
and lowest in red clover silage. The addition of tannin had no effect (P > 0.05) on 
effective degradability.

Total DM intake had a mean value of 20.9 kg/d and was higher (P = 0.009) in 
cows fed diets containing lucerne silage (Table 29). There was no effects of forage 
source or tannin inclusion (P > 0.05) on milk fat, milk protein or milk lactose 
content and had mean values of 41.5, 33.7 and 48.9 g/kg respectively. Forage

5.4 Discussion 
5.4.1 Feed analysis  
This is the first study to investigate the addition of hydrolysable tannins to lucerne 
and red clover silages in a maize silage based diet as dietary treatments to 
compare effects on animal performance, milk quality and apparent digestibility in 
high yielding dairy cows. The dry matter content of all the forages in the current 
study fell between ranges of 215  456 g/kg, however, the lucerne silages had the 
largest DM content while red clover silages were 238 g/kg lower. The DM content 
of lucerne and red clover silages differed to previous studies by Hymes  Fecht et 
al. (2013) and Broderick et al. (2000) in which the DM content averaged 52 g/kg 
lower for lucerne silage and 308 g/kg higher for red clover silage than the silages 
in the current study. In the study of Broderick et al. (2000), both the lucerne and 
red clover silages were a mixture of first, second and third cuts whereas in the 
current study both silages were second cut. Similarly Hymes  Fecht et al. (2013), 
also fed second cut lucerne and red clover silages, however the difference in DM 
content may reflect the different varieties of lucerne and red clover used. In the 
current study, varieties Daisy (lucerne) and Corvus (red clover) were used 
whereas Hymes - Fecht et al. (2013) used Forecast 1001 and Rebound 4.2 
(lucerne) while the red clover variety was Marathon. Alternatively, wilting time and 
weather conditions may have influenced the DM content between studies. 
The crude protein content of lucerne and red clover silages in the current study 
were similar to values observed in previous studies (Broderick et al., 2001; 
Broderick et al., 2000 and Hoffman et al., 1997), with red clover silage having a 
lower CP content. For all the forages, pH values were below pH 4.6 suggesting the 
forages had fermented, which was reflected by the rapid drop in pH between days 
1 and 7 post ensiling. The lactic acid content of the lucerne silages indicated good 
fermentation and preservation as the content was above 60 g/kg DM, similar to 
previous study by Dewhurst et al. (2003). However, in the current study, the red 
clover silages had high levels of butyric acid and ammonia nitrogen indicating poor 
fermentation and preservation. The poorer quality of red clover silage may have 
been influenced by the DM content at ensiling and weather conditions during the 
wilting period as there were periods of rainfall prior to harvesting. Fibre levels 
observed in the current study were higher in the red clover than the lucerne silage, 
but were similar to that reported by Hymes - Fecht et al. (2013).  
Tannin content in the current study for lucerne and red clover silage without tannin 
had values of 16.2 and 23.5 g/kg DM. Hymes-Fecht et al. (2013) reported lucerne 
silage to have no naturally occurring tannins while red clover silage had a tannin 
content of 2.3 g/kg DM. These variations in tannin content between the current 
study and Hymes-Fecht et al. (2013) may reflect the sensitivity of the methodology 
used as there was an intra-assay CV of 22.5%. This high CV indicates the 
presence of a large variation between samples suggesting that the tannin content 
was not consistent throughout the clamps of silage. This intra-assay CV may also 
indicate that the method used to determine tannin content in the current study had 
poor sensitivity for the level of tannins present in the silages. Although, the 
addition of tannins did increase the tannin content of lucerne and red clover silage 
slightly by 5.8 and 1.6 g/kg DM, respectively, this was lower than expected, as 
hydrolysable tannins were added at a rate of 25 g/kg DM. It may indicate that the 
tannins were not fully homogenised throughout the clamps, resulting in variable 
samples which may be attributable to the application and mixing method of the 
tannin to the forage prior to ensiling. The reliability of these results require further 
assessment, the current method used was the butanol-HCl assay. An alternative 
method that could be used to investigate tannin levels in lucerne and red clover 
silage is the acidified vanillin assay. However, a previous study (Broadhurst and 
Jones, 1978) investigated the effects of temperature and light on the sensitivity of 
the acidified vanillin assay and observed varying results. It was observed that both 
light and temperature influenced the assay and therefore impacted on the tannin 
concentration measured. As time increased, it was observed that there was a 
decline in absorbance when the reaction was exposed to light. However, this 
decline could be prevented by completing the reaction in the dark with the samples 
remaining stable for up to 60 minutes. The ambient temperature also affected the 
rate of the reaction. Where the assay was incubated at a temperature of 25C it 
took 12.5 minutes to reach maximum absorbance, whereas at lower temperatures 
of 20C and 15C it took longer (Broadhurst and Jones, 1978). Therefore, 
temperature and light were potentially affecting the butanol-HCl assay used in the 
current study thus impacting the estimation of tannin concentrations. This would 
suggest that the butanol-HCl assay needs to be further investigated to optimise 
the temperature and light to enhance the sensitivity of the technique. Therefore, it 
can be concluded that multiple variables have potentially influenced the tannin 
concentrations observed in this experiment.  
5.4.2 Degradation characteristics 
Forage had an effect on the soluble DM fraction (a) where lucerne silage had 
higher content, and the potential degradable fraction (b), where red clover silage 
had higher content. The soluble protein fraction (a) was increased by the 
supplementation of tannins in the current study. In contrast, Tabacco et al. (2006) 
reported a decrease in the soluble protein fraction as the inclusion rate of 
hydrolysable tannin increased from 0, 20, 40 to 60 g/kg DM in lucerne silage. Rate 
of degradation (c) for DM and CP was higher in lucerne than red clover silage 
which is consistent with Coblentz et al. (1998) and Tabacco et al. (2006). These 
observations are similar to that reported by Broderick et al. (2004) when protein 
degradation was conducted in vitro, with lucerne silage having a faster rate of 
degradation compared to red clover silage. Effective degradation was also 
affected by dietary treatment for DM and CP with lucerne silage being higher than 
red clover silage and for DM, supplementation of tannin increased the effective 
degradation of red clover silage but not lucerne silage. In contrast, Tabacco et al. 
(2006) reported a decrease in effective protein degradability as the 
supplementation of hydrolysable tannin increased in lucerne silage. Tabacco  et al. 
(2006) concluded that the addition of tannins could reduce the high rumen 
degradable protein that is associated with forage legumes like lucerne and red 
clover silages, although the results from the current study, where hydrolysable 
tannin was included at 25 g/kg DM does not support this. 
5.4.3 Animal performance 
In the mid-lactation dairy cows used in the current study, DM intake was improved 
by the inclusion of lucerne silage in a maize based diet. In previous studies 
(Hoffman et al., 1998; and Dewhurst et al., 2003) improvements in DM intake have 
been reported when cows were fed lucerne silage compared to feeding grass 
silage alone. In contrast, in studies (Arndt et al., 2015 and Sinclair et al., 2015) 
comparing different inclusion rates of lucerne silage in a maize silage based TMR, 
DM intake did not differ between treatments except in Sinclair et al. (2015) who 
reported a drop in DM intake when lucerne silage was included in the TMR at a 
rate of 60 % forage DM. Dry matter intakes have been shown to be improved by 
red clover silage when fed as a sole forage or at high inclusion rate in a grass 
based diet (Moorby et al., 2009; and Bertilsson and Murphy., 2003). Similar to the 
current study, Broderick et al. (2000) reported a higher DM intake 1.2 kg/d in cows 
offered lucerne silage over red clover silage. Broderick et al. (2000) concluded this 
difference in DM intake may be attributable to the higher CP content of 36 g/kg DM 
in the diets containing lucerne silage. However in the current study, the differences 
in DM intake may be attributable to the quality of the red clover silage which had 
high levels of butyric acid and ammonia nitrogen indicating poor fermentation and 
preservation. In addition, the high difference in DM content of the lucerne and red 
clover silages (238 g/kg DM) may have influenced DM intake.  
Although DM intake was improved by lucerne silage, cows fed lucerne and red 
clover silages had a similar milk yield. Similarly, Broderick et al. (2000) and Hymes 
 Fecht et al. (2013) reported no effect on milk yield when cows were offered 
lucerne or red clover silage. In contrast, Hoffman et al. (1998) reported increased 
milk yields of 1.6 kg/d when comparing lucerne silage to grass silage. Previous 
studies have reported improvements in milk yield when red clover silage was 
compared with grass silage (Moorby et al., 2009); or as part of maize based diet 
(Moorby et al., 2016). The similarity in milk yields in the current study may be 
attributed to the similar crude protein content of all four treatment diets.  
There was no effect of dietary treatment on milk fat, milk protein or milk lactose 
content in the current study. Arndt et al. (2015) also reported no effect of dietary 
treatment on milk fat or lactose content. However a decrease in milk protein was 
reported as lucerne silage in the diet increased from 20 to 80 % forage DM. 
Similarly, Moorby et al. (2009) and Moorby et al. (2016) reported a decline in milk 
protein content as the amount of red clover silage in the diet increased from 0 to 
100 % forage DM.  These changes in milk protein content as the amount of 
legume silage in the diet increases may reflect the high rumen degradable protein 
that is present in legume silages, therefore reducing the amount of metabolisable 
protein available for digestion in the small intestine. The responses in milk 
composition observed in the current study may have differed if the inclusion rate of 
hydrolysable tannins had been higher allowing an increase in rumen undegradable 
protein being available in the small intestine. However, in a previous study, Taha, 
(2015) fed hydrolysable tannin at four inclusion rates (0, 25, 50 or 75 g/kg DM) to 
lactating ewes and found that there was no effect on milk protein suggesting that 
there was no increase in availability of RUP in the small intestine when tannin was 
added to the diet. Similarly, Lui et al. (2013) found that the inclusion of 
hydrolysable tannins at 10 g/kg DM in the diet of early lactating dairy cows had no 
effect on milk protein. Therefore, the current study used an inclusion rate of 25 
g/kg DM of hydrolysable tannins as milk yields were highest in ewes fed 25 g/kg 
DM hydrolysable tannin in the study by Taha, (2015). The inclusion of tannins 
however, had no effect on N efficiency in the current study, however forage source 
had a significant effect with N efficiency improved in cows fed red clover compared 
to lucerne silages principally due to the lower DMI in red clover fed cows. The 
higher N efficiency with red clover silage may be related to the presence of PPO 
binding with the protein (Lee, 2014), increasing the amount of RUP available for 
digestion in the small intestine. The lack of an effect of tannin on N efficiency is 
consistent with Dschaak et al. (2011) when lucerne hay was supplemented with 30 
g/kg DM of condensed tannin. In contrast, Gerlach et al. (2018) reported a decline 
in N efficiency when grass silage was supplemented with condensed tannins at a 
rate of 30 g/kg DM. Dschaak et al. (2011) suggested that these observations in N 
efficiency may be due to no change in milk protein yield which is consistent with 
the current study.  
5.4.4 Milk FA composition and blood metabolites 
Inclusion of tannins had no effect on milk FA composition, however forage source 
altered a number of FAs. Milk fat content of C4:0, C18:2 n-6 and C18:3 n-3 were 
all higher in milk from cows fed red clover compared to lucerne silage. The 
changes in linoleic acid (C18:2 n-6) and -linolenic acid (C18:3 n-3) are consistent 
with previous studies where red clover silage has been compared to grass silage 
(Halmemies-Beauchet-Filleau et al., 2014; Dewhurst et al., 2003; Vanhatalo et al., 
2007). Moorby et al. (2009) suggested that changes in linoleic acid and -linolenic 
acid in milk may be a result of lowered biohydrogenation of forage fatty acids in 
the rumen possibly influenced by the polyphenol oxidase (PPO) enzyme system 
that is present in red clover silage. Similar to the current study, Lee et al. (2009) 
observed an increase in milk fat content of C18:2 n-6 and C18:3 n-3 in cows fed 
fresh red clover compared to cows fed fresh grass. Lee et al. (2009) suggested 
that the linoleic acid and -linolenic acid are provided protection from rumen 
metabolism by the presence and binding of PPO in the red clover. Lucerne silage 
improved milk fatty acids C12:0, C15:0, C17:0 and C22:0 compared to cows fed 
red clover silage. Similarly, Leduc et al. (2017) reported increased levels in milk 
fatty acid concentrations of C12:0, C15:0 and C17:0 in cows fed lucerne silage 
compared to red clover silage as part of a TMR based diet. Leduc et al. (2017) 
suggested these increases in FA content of C15:0 and C17:0 may be due to 
higher concentrations of propionate and valerate available in the rumen for 
elongation during rumen fermentation by the microorganisms to form C15:0 and 
C17:0. Similarly, Sinclair et al. (2015) observed an increase in concentration of 
C17:0 from 0.48 to 0.51 g/100g when lucerne silage was increased in the diet of 
dairy cows from 20 to 60%, respectively. However, in contrast to the current study, 
Sinclair et al. (2015) observed an increase in C18:2 n-6 and C18:3 n-3 as lucerne 
in the diet increased, suggesting that biohydrogenation was reduced in the rumen. 
Dietary treatment had no effect on fatty acids of chain length more than C16, 
indicating uptake from the diet or less than C16, indicating de novo synthesis, in 
the mammary gland. Supplementation with tannins had no effect on milk fatty acid 
content in the current study. In contrast, Dschaak et al. (2011) observed increases 
in milk fat content of 18:3 n-3 and 20:1 when lucerne hay was supplemented with 
condensed tannins and suggested these changes were caused by the tannins 
impeding microbes in the rumen therefore changing biohydrogenation pathways. 
In the current study, it was observed that there was an increase in C22:0 when 
tannin was added to both lucerne and red clover; however, it is unlikely that the 
tannins brought about an increase in FA C22:0 as  there was no measurable 
difference in the tannin levels of the lucerne or red clover silage with 
supplemented tannins. Therefore, the increase in FA C22:0 may due to an artefact 
in the FAME and hexane sample that was observed by the GC. Apart from this 
observation, in the current study, the inclusion of hydrolysable tannin had no effect 
on the milk FA profile. It remains to be determined whether inclusion of tannins at 
levels higher than 25 g/kg DM significantly effects on milk FA profile observed. 
Dietary treatment had no significant effects on blood metabolites in the current 
study. Dewhurst et al. (2003) observed an increase in plasma urea when cows 
were fed lucerne silage compared to red clover silage, however crude protein 
content of the diets varied by 30 g/kg DM. Similarly, Broderick et al. (2000) 
observed increases in plasma urea in cows fed lucerne silage when crude protein 
was not balanced across treatments. However, in the current study, no significant 
effects were observed in plasma urea concentrations. All four diets were 
formulated to have a similar CP, MPE and MPN content. However, the silage 
analyses indicate that CP was higher in the lucerne silage. Also the DM intake was 
higher by 2.2 kg/d in cows fed lucerne silage, so N intakes were 93 g/d higher. 
Plasma BHB levels lower than 0.9 mmol/l indicate a cow is post peak lactation and 
has a positive energy balance (Topps and Thompson, 1984); all plasma BHB 
levels observed in the current study were lower than 0.9 mmol/l.   
5.4.5 Apparent whole-tract digestibility 
Digestibility of DM, OM and N were not affected by dietary treatment in the current 
study. Similarly, when lucerne hay was supplemented with condensed tannins, 
Dschaak et al. (2011) observed no differences in DM, OM or CP digestibility. In 
contrast, Hymes-Fecht et al. (2013) observed increases in DM and OM digestibility 
when red clover silage was offered to dairy cows compared to lucerne silage, 
however nitrogen digestibility was similar for cows fed lucerne and red clover 
silage. Similarly, Broderick et al. (2000) and Broderick et al. (2001) reported higher 
DM and OM digestibility when cows were offered red clover than lucerne silage 
suggesting that red clover silage is degraded more rapidly than lucerne silage. 
However, the observations in the current study would suggest that all diets were 
degraded at a similar rate in the rumen. The higher DM intakes by cows fed 
lucerne silage in the current study was reflected in OM and N intakes; in contrast, 
Hoffman et al. (1997) observed no difference in CP intake when lucerne and red 
clover silages were offered to dairy cows. Hoffman et al. (1998) observed 
improved DM and CP intakes when dairy cows were offered lucerne silage 
compared to grass silage and these differences were related to the higher rate of 
passage observed in cows fed lucerne silage. In the current study, it may be 
suggested that the lucerne silage had a higher rate of passage than red clover 
silage, although rumen outflow rate was not determined. However, the main 
suggestion for these differences would be the higher DM intake response in cows 
fed lucerne silage. 
5.5 Conclusions 
In conclusion, dry matter intake was higher in cows fed lucerne silage. Forage type 
and tannin inclusion did not improve milk yield, milk fat or milk protein content. 
Blood metabolites were unaffected by type of forage or tannin inclusion. Cows fed 
lucerne silage had higher organic matter and nitrogen intake, however dietary 
treatment did not affect DM, OM or nitrogen digestibility. Cows fed red clover 
silage had higher levels of milk FAs C18:2 n-6 and C18:3 n-3, however inclusion of 
tannins had no overall effect on milk FA composition. Forage type had an effect on 
soluble DM fraction and potential DM degradable fraction being higher in lucerne 
and red clover silage, respectively. Lucerne silage had a faster rate of degradation 
for DM and CP than red clover silage. Inclusion of tannin increased soluble CP 
fraction and effective degradability in red clover silage. Overall, a concern with the 
current study is the apparent lack of effect of tannin application on the tannin 
concentrations reported in the silages. Therefore, the lack of a change in in cow 
performance in response to the inclusion of tannins may be related to the low rate 
of application of tannins.  
Chapter 6 General discussion  
6.1 Introduction 
Over the past 10 years, there has been a greater interest in home grown protein 
sources in the UK dairy industry. Previous studies have focussed their 
investigations on forage legumes as an alternative to grass silage, whereas very 
few studies have compared the different forage legumes that can be grown in the 
UK. Similarly, a few studies have investigated the use of tannins as a method of 
improving RUP within forage legumes, however in these studies the tannins have 
been supplemented to the diet at feed out rather than at ensiling. Therefore, the 
current studies are the first study to investigate forage legumes containing 
naturally occurring tannins or the addition of tannins at ensiling on animal 
performance of high yielding dairy cows. 
6.2 The effect of condensed tannins on nutritive value and dairy cow performance 
Nutritive value of forage legumes post ensiling varies between species, thereby 
having the potential to influence the performance of a high yielding dairy cow. 
Condensed tannins are found naturally within forage peas and occur at varying 
levels depending on the flower colour, peas which have coloured flowers tend to 
have higher levels than peas with white flowers (Wang et al., 1998). Previously, it 
has been shown that forage peas have high CP contents of between 170 to 220 
g/kg DM (Mustafa et al., 2000; Hart et al., 2011) with the current study reporting 
values of 161 and 195 g/kg DM in experiment 1, whilst in experiment 2, CP levels 
of 208 and 195 g/kg DM were reported for red pea and white pea silage, 
respectively. However, in forage legumes this protein tends to be degraded rapidly 
within in the rumen resulting in low quantities of RUP available in the small 
intestine (Sinclair et al., 2009). Tannins have the ability to form a tannin-protein 
complex at pH 4.5  7.0 in either the silo or rumen, therefore improving the 
availability of RUP in the small intestine (McMahon et al., 2000). The microbial 
protein in a high yielding dairy cow is not sufficient to supply the cows MP 
requirement, therefore the cow requires RUP in the diet to meet these 
requirements (McDonald et al., 2011). The addition of condensed tannins in 
experiment 1, had no effect on CP content of forage pea silages suggesting that 
there was no reduction in proteolysis in the silo therefore there was no increase in 
the amount of RUP available. Similar to experiment 1, Adesogan and Salawu, 
(2002) observed no change in total N when 16 g/kg DM condensed tannins were 
added to a pea-wheat bi-crop at ensiling. Although, ammonia-nitrogen content was 
reduced, with a content of 130 g/kg total N for silage with no tannin and 94.7 g/kg 
total N for silage that had 16 g/kg DM condensed tannin added. Although in the 
current study, the addition of condensed tannins to forage peas (Chapter 4) had 
no change on ammonia-nitrogen content. Therefore, it can be concluded that the 
addition of condensed tannins to forage pea silages has very little influence on 
nutritive value or availability of RUP. Consequently, experiment 2 investigated the 
effects of the natural levels of condensed tannin in forage pea silages on dairy cow 
performance.  
In experiment 2, the total replacement of grass silage with either red or white pea 
silage reduced DM intake and milk yield which may be attributed to the difference 
in CP content of the forages however had no effect on diet digestibility. In a 
previous study conducted by Sinclair et al. (2009), it was found that the inclusion 
of pea silage in the diet of dairy cows improved DM intakes compared to cows fed 
grass silage, although milk yields were unaffected. These differences may be 
attributable to the amount of forage pea silage included in the diet, in experiment 2 
forage pea silages were included at 0.4 of the forage DM whereas in Sinclair et al. 
(2009) the forage pea silages were included at 0.5 of the forage DM. Sinclair et al. 
(2009) concluded that the lack of change in milk yield may be due to the dairy cow 
utilising the nutrients from the forage pea silages for her body stores rather than 
milk production although there was no BCS change observed. In the current study, 
there was no change in BCS which averaged 2.87 suggesting that the cow was 
not utilising the nutrients from the forage pea silages for her body stores.  
Since completion of experiment 2, more recent research (Broderick et al., 2017) 
investigated the effects of increasing levels of naturally occurring condensed 
tannins from 5.1 to 16.6 g/kg DM in birdsfoot trefoil silage on performance of high 
yielding dairy cows. These levels of condensed tannins in the birdsfoot trefoil 
silages were much lower than in the forage pea silages of experiment 2 which 
averaged 62.9 g/kg DM. In two trials conducted by Broderick et al. (2017), DM 
intake and milk yield averaged the highest at 26.8 and 41.3 kg/d, respectively, in 
cows fed birdsfoot trefoil silage containing 10 g/kg DM condensed tannins. In 
contrast, Hymes-Fecht et al. (2013) found that milk yield was highest in cows fed 
birdsfoot trefoil silage containing the highest amount of condensed tannin at 15.7 
g/kg DM although DM intake was unaffected. These contradicting results from 
previous studies and the current study make it unclear what the optimal level of 
naturally occurring condensed tannins in forage legumes would be for optimising 
DM intake and milk production in dairy cows. It has been suggested (Hymes-Fecht 
et al., 2013 and Gerlach et al., 2018) that levels of higher than 30 g/kg DM of 
condensed tannins in the diet can have a detrimental effect on DM intake and milk 
yield, therefore in the current study, this may be the reason there was a reduced 
DM intake and milk yield compared to cows fed grass silage. However, these 
higher levels of condensed tannin were used in the current study due to a previous 
study by Sinclair et al. (2009) observing improved DM intakes with forage pea 
silage containing condensed tannin at levels higher than 30 g/kg DM.  
Savings can be made by the reduction of the use of imported dietary protein with 
the use of forage legumes in the diet of high yielding dairy cows due to their high 
crude protein content. In experiment 2, there was a saving in soyabean meal of 
approximately 0.4 kg/cow/day when cows were fed forage pea silages, this would 
be a significant saving for a commercial dairy cow herd. For a 100 cow herd with a 
lactation period of 305 days this saving would equate to a 12.2 tonne reduction in 
SBM which would be an overall cost saving of 3891 at 319 per tonne. 
Therefore, the overall conclusion from experiment 2 and the previous published 
studies would suggest that any commercial advantage from feeding forage 
legumes containing condensed tannins to high yielding dairy cows will be based 
on savings in N from fertiliser or dietary protein (Sinclair et al., 2009). 
6.3 The effect of hydrolysable tannins on nutritive value and dairy cow 
performance 
Forage legumes, lucerne and red clover, contain either no or low levels of naturally 
occurring tannins, respectively. In these forage legumes, there is no protection of 
the protein from tannins in the silo or rumen although red clover silage contains 
the enzyme, polyphenol oxidase, which inhibits protein degradation by the binding 
of o-quinones with forage protein (Broderick et al., 2000; Hoffman et al., 1997; 
Jones et al., 1995). Polyphenol oxidase provides protection to the protein in red 
clover silage in both the silo and rumen, with the protein becoming available in the 
small intestine (Lee, 2014). Therefore, experiment 1 and 3 investigated the effects 
of the addition of hydrolysable tannins to lucerne and red clover silages on 
nutritive value and dairy cow performance. Similar to the forage peas used in 
experiment 1 and 2, lucerne and red clover silages have been reported to have 
high CP content with values varying between 166 to 220 g/kg DM in previous 
studies (Broderick et al., 2000; Broderick et al., 2001 and Broderick et al., 2005). 
In the current study, CP values of 179 and 110 g/kg DM were reported in 
experiment 1, whilst in experiment 3, CP levels of 219 and 164 g/kg DM were 
reported for lucerne and red clover silage, respectively. The differences in CP 
content between the two experiments may be due to the different years and fields 
that the forages were grown in, similarly weather conditions at wilting and harvest 
may have influenced the CP content. In both experiments, the addition of 
hydrolysable tannins to the silages did not affect CP content suggesting that 
proteolysis was not reduced in the silo. Similarly, Tabacco et al. (2006) observed 
no effect of the addition of hydrolysable tannins on the total N content of lucerne 
silage. Therefore, from these studies, it can be concluded that hydrolysable 
tannins do not provide protection to the protein in the silo. The protein in the red 
clover silage may have been provided protection from the polyphenol oxidase; 
however this was not measured in the current study, although ammonia-nitrogen 
content was higher in the red clover silages suggesting protection of nitrogen. 
Overall, it can be concluded that the addition of hydrolysable tannins to lucerne or 
red clover silage had very little influence on the nutritive value. In a previous study, 
Taha, (2015) observed reduced milk yields in Suffolk cross ewes when 
hydrolysable tannins were added to lucerne silage at feed out at levels of 50 or 75 
g/kg DM, however there was an increase in milk yield when the sheep were fed 25 
g/kg DM. Following results from this study and experiment 1, experiment 3 
investigated the effect of the addition of hydrolysable tannin at 25 g/kg DM at 
ensiling in lucerne and red clover silage on the performance of high yielding dairy 
cows.  
In experiment 3, DM intakes were influenced by forage type rather than inclusion 
of tannin, with cows fed lucerne silage having higher DM intakes. Milk yield, milk 
fat and protein content were not significantly affected by forage type or tannin 
inclusion. There are few studies that have compared lucerne and red clover silage, 
however the results shown in experiment 3 are agreeable with Broderick et al. 
(2000) who showed a 1.2 kg/d increase in DM intake in cows fed lucerne silage. 
Differences in DM intake in the current study and Broderick et al. (2000) may be 
attributable to the variation in DM and CP content of lucerne and red clover silage 
in which CP varied by 54.5 and 36 g/kg DM for the current study and Broderick et 
al. (2000), respectively. Thus had these variables had been similar, DM intake 
may have been similar, however lucerne silage tends to have a higher CP content 
than red clover silage as seen in previous studies (Hymes-Fecht et al., 2013; 
Dewhurst et al., 2003; Broderick et al., 2001).  
The findings of experiment 3 are in agreement with a recent meta-analysis 
conducted by Johansen et al. (2018). Dairy cows fed lucerne silage had higher DM 
intakes compared to dairy cows fed red clover silage, however there was no 
difference in milk yield or BCS suggesting that the cow was not utilising the 
nutrients. Although, the current study observed no significant effect of forage type 
on milk protein which was slightly lower in cows fed red clover silage, Johansen et 
al. (2018) reported that dairy cows fed red clover silage had a lower milk protein 
content than cows fed lucerne or grass silage. In cows fed red clover silage, the 
expected milk protein levels would be higher due to the presence of PPO that 
binds to the forage protein preventing breakdown in the rumen thereby causing a 
shift of RDP to RUP, therefore there is an availability of amino acids in the small 
intestine (Lee, 2014). However, data from experiment 3, and Johansen et al. 
(2018) show this isnt the case, there was no effect of forage type on milk protein 
suggesting that the presence of PPO in the red clover silage did not improve 
availability of amino acids in the small intestine. Therefore, the current study 
suggests that the lucerne and red clover silage were providing the same quantities 
of amino acids in the small intestine.  
Since the completion of experiment 3, more recent research (Gerlach et al., 2018) 
has shown that the inclusion of condensed tannins at varying rates from 10 to 30 
g/kg DM had no influence on DM intake, milk yield or energy corrected milk. 
Inclusion rates in experiment 3 and Gerlach et al. (2018) are below 30 g/kg DM 
which has been suggested to be too low to influence DM intake or milk yield when 
fed to dairy cows. However, in experiment 2 the natural levels of condensed tannin 
at 67.2 and 58.6 g/kg DM for white and red pea silage, respectively, observed 
reduced DM intakes and milk yield. A concern for both experiments is the tannin 
levels measured within the forage legumes used in the current study. In 
experiment 2, the red pea silage would be expected to have higher levels of 
condensed tannin than the white pea silage whilst in experiment 3, the inclusion of 
25 g/kg DM hydrolysable tannin to lucerne and red clover silage is not apparent. In 
the current study, the method used to determine tannin content was according to 
Makkar et al. (1993), the similar levels observed may be due to the sensitivity of 
the method. A previous study by Broadhurst and Jones, (1978) investigated how 
the acidified vanillin assay reacted to different temperatures and levels of light. It 
was observed that light levels influenced the stability of the absorbance with the 
assay whilst temperature influenced the rate of the reaction to reach maximum 
absorbance. It is clear from this previous study that tannin determination is 
sensitive to temperature and light levels, therefore the assay in the current study 
requires optimisation for temperature and light levels. In experiment 2 and 3, the 
butanol-HCl assay used to determine tannin content was conducted in the dark, 
however, the lab was not temperature controlled, and therefore the contradicting 
results observed may be attributable to the lab conditions. In experiment 3, the 
apparently similarity in tannin content between the non-tannin silage and tannin 
supplemented silage may be attributable to the application process of the tannin. 
Thus, it can be concluded that there are a number of possible variables which may 
have influenced the tannin content of the forage legume silages used in 
experiment 2 and 3. Therefore, the overall conclusion from previous studies and 
experiment 3 would suggest that the inclusion of tannins at ensiling are an 
ineffective method for the improvement of nitrogen use and milk performance in 
dairy cows.  
6.4 Influence of forage legumes and tannins on milk fatty acid profile 
In experiment 2 and 3, the composition of milk FAs were measured to investigate 
whether the inclusion of forage legumes and tannins in the diet of dairy cows 
altered the milk fatty acid profile. It is known that different forages provide varying 
concentrations of FAs and the PUFAs present in the forage will undergo 
biohydrogenation in the rumen to form saturated FAs, in particular C18:0 (Jenkins 
et al., 2008). The presence of tannins in the forage or silage have been shown to 
alter the pathway of biohydrogenation (Turner et al., 2005; Khiaosa-Ard et al., 
2009) whilst the presence of PPO in red clover silage has been shown to provide 
protection to the PUFAs (Lee et al., 2009b; Leduc et al., 2017). Therefore, it was 
important to include these measurements within the current studies to determine if 
there were any changes in milk FA profile of dairy cows fed forage legumes. In 
experiment 2, there were minor changes to the milk FA profile when dairy cows 
were fed either red or white pea silage, C16:0 was higher in cows fed white pea 
silage whereas C18:3 n-3 was higher in cows fed red pea silage. In both white and 
red pea silages the concentrations of C18:3 n-3 were the same at 1.76 g/kg DM, 
however the grass silage had a higher concentration at 5.09 g/kg DM. Similarly, 
previous studies, (Turner et al., 2005; Dschaak et al., 2011), observed higher 
levels of C18:3 n-3 with the presence of condensed tannins in either birdsfoot 
trefoil or lucerne hay, respectively. It was suggested that the condensed tannins 
were altering the pathway of biohydrogenation, thereby reducing the amount of 
PUFAs being transformed into C18:0 and improving the concentrations of these 
PUFAs in the milk. In the current study, it could be suggested that the condensed 
tannins present in red pea silage were altering the biohydrogenation pathway in 
the rumen but not in cows fed the white pea silage. The low levels of C18:3 n-3 
present in the milk of dairy cows fed grass silage would suggest that the PUFAs 
were undergoing biohydrogenation in the rumen. In contrast, cows fed grass silage 
in the current study had higher concentrations of C18:2 n-6 than the cows fed 
either white or red pea silage, these differences may be due to the higher levels 
present in the grass silage.  
In experiment 3, forage type influenced the milk fatty acid profile of dairy cows 
rather than the presence of tannins in the diet. Cows fed red clover silage had 
higher concentrations of both C18:2 n-6 and C18:3 n-3 PUFAs compared to cows 
fed lucerne silage. The presence of these fatty acids within the silage were lower 
in the red clover silage which would suggest that there was a reduction in 
biohydrogenation in the rumen of cows fed red clover silage. These results are 
consistent with previous studies (Dewhurst et al., 2003; Vanhatalo et al., 2007) 
when red clover silage was compared with grass silage. It has been suggested by 
Lee et al. (2009) that these changes in milk FA profile of dairy cows fed red clover 
silage are due to the presence of PPO in the red clover silage. The PPO is able to 
provide protection to the PUFAs from metabolism and biohydrogenation in the 
rumen by binding to the FAs, therefore there will be higher concentrations present 
in the milk. It can be concluded in the current study that the presence of PPO was 
having an influence on the milk FA profile in cows fed red clover silage. Overall, it 
can be concluded from the current studies that the milk FA profile of dairy cows 
can be influenced by the forage type and the presence of either tannins or PPO. 
6.5 Nitrogen efficiency in dairy cows fed forage legumes 
An objective of both dairy cow studies (Chapter 4 and 5) was to investigate the 
effect of forage legumes with naturally occurring or supplemented tannins on 
nitrogen efficiency. Nitrogen efficiency is the conversion of feed N to milk N 
(Calsamiglia et al., 2010), and in the current studies, cows fed either white pea or 
lucerne silage had the lowest N efficiency in their respective treatments, although 
N efficiency in the current studies were high and above 0.32 kg milk N/kg feed N. It 
has been shown that N efficiency increases as the amount of RDP decreases in 
the diet, suggesting that a higher amount of N is captured in the rumen efficiently 
(Calsamiglia et al., 2010). In contrast, in a study by Broderick et al. (2001) N 
efficiency was lower and had a mean value of 0.24 kg milk N/kg feed N in dairy 
cows fed either lucerne or red clover silage. In the current studies, the protein and 
metabolisable protein content of the diets were formulated to be similar, however 
there was a variation in N intake between treatment groups. Interpretation of the N 
efficiency results is limited due to this N intake variation, however when N 
efficiency and N intake results are considered together there was a negative 
relationship (P = 0.014; Figure 33). The addition of tannins to red clover or lucerne 
silage had no effect on N efficiency. However when total N intake was considered, 
a decline in N efficiency became apparent with the addition of hydrolysable tannins 
to lucerne silage. Although, there was an increase in N efficiency when total N 
intake was considered for red clover silage that had supplemented hydrolysable 
tannins. In a previous study, the effect of N intake on N efficiency has been shown 
by Dewhurst et al. (2003) who observed no effect on N efficiency following the 
increase of concentrate in the diet from 4 to 8 kg/d. However, when N intakes were 
considered, N efficiency showed a decline as the amount of concentrate in the diet 
declined (Dewhurst et al., 2003). In more recent research, Gerlach et al. (2018) 
supplemented grass silage with 30 g/kg DM of condensed tannins and observed a 
decline in N efficiency. It has been reported by Poppi and McLennan, (1995) that 
the presence of legumes in the diet can increase protein intake, although the 
intestinal supply of protein per unit of DMI does not always increase at the same 
rate due to losses in the rumen. Therefore, Poppi and McLennan, (1995) 
concluded that the availability of N at intake will influence the utilisation of the 
amino acids in the small intestines thereby influencing N efficiency. Therefore, 
these studies suggest that the relationship between N efficiency and N intake is 
y = -0.0005x + 0.6393
R = 0.7342
450 500 550 600 650
N intake (g/day)
significant and more important than the N degradability, and requires further 
investigation.

lucerne plus tannin silage, RC = red clover silage and RT = red clover plus tannin 
silage).  
6.6 Limitations of experimental design 
Following completion of experiments 1, 2 and 3 it has become clear that there are 
aspects of the experiments which could have been altered to improve the reliability 
of the results. A key area that requires further investigation is the tannin assay 
methodology. Future studies are needed to ascertain the optimal temperature and 
light conditions to ensure the sensitivity of the method. Further to this, the 
application and mixing of the tannins to the forage needs consideration to ensure 
that the tannin is evenly applied to avoid differences in tannin concentrations 
throughout the clamp. In experiment 1, further consideration could be made to 
investigate the effectiveness of application of tannins before ensiling and various 
stages throughout the fermentation process to ascertain how the evenly the 
tannins have been applied.  
In experiment 1 and 3, mini silos of each forage were produced to investigate how 
the addition of condensed or hydrolysable tannins affected nutritive value of the 
final silage. Additionally, experiment 3 investigated how DM, CP and pH altered 
over the course of ensiling from day 1 to 120. However, fermentation profile was 
not considered in the current study. Therefore, a potential measurement for both of 
these experiments would be to investigate the effect of tannins on fermentation 
profile over the course of ensiling.  
Previous studies have considered varying levels of condensed or hydrolysable 
tannin in the diet of dairy cows, however experiment 3 only considered two levels 
of hydrolysable tannins at 0 or 25 g/kg DM. An alteration to the study design would 
be to consider a wider range of inclusion rates of hydrolysable tannin to lucerne 
and red clover silage ranging from 25 to 60 g/kg DM as Taha, (2015) observed 
decreased milk yields when 75 g/kg DM of hydrolysable tannins were fed to 
sheep. Investigating a wider range of inclusion rates would allow the study to 
potentially determine the optimal level of hydrolysable tannin to feed to dairy cows 
to improve performance. The optimal levels may vary between species of 
commercially used forages and potentially between types of tannin, therefore the 
proposed study may provide important information that is currently inconsistent 
from previous studies (Sinclair et al., 2009; Broderick et al., 2017; Tabacco et al., 
2006; Gerlach et al., 2018).  
In a meta-analysis by Johansen et al. (2018), it was concluded that dairy cows fed 
forage legumes can achieve higher DM intakes and milk yields than those fed 
diets containing grass silages. In experiment 3, it was observed that dairy cows 
fed lucerne silage had higher DM intakes, however a grass based diet was not 
included as part of this study therefore it is difficult to compare these studies. A 
change of design to experiment 3 may consider the inclusion of grass silage as a 
control diet as this silage is typically included in diets fed to dairy cows in the UK. 
However, in experiment 2, it was observed that dairy cows fed forage pea silages 
had a reduced DM intake and milk yield compared to dairy cows fed grass silage. 
In both experiment 2 and 3, the study design was a Latin square design therefore 
dairy cows received the diets for a period of 28 days which was considered a 
suitable adaptation period before data collection. To fully understand these varying 
results in DM intake and milk performance, the design of the experiments could 
involve a longer adaptation period or the forages could be fed over the course of a 
lactation to understand the full effects of forage legumes on the full lactation 
performance of dairy cows. Potential further measurements to consider for a study 
scheduled over a full lactation would be the methane emissions of the dairy cows 
fed forage legumes with the inclusion of tannins. A previous study (Grainger et al., 
2009) fed condensed tannins at two rates, 163 and 244 g/day, to early lactating 
dairy cows grazing a ryegrass pasture. Methane emissions were reduced by both 
levels of condensed tannins in the diet with levels reduced by 14 and 29% for 163 
and 244 g/day, respectively. Therefore, it would be interesting to investigate how 
tannins in forage legumes included as part of a maize-based diet may influence 
methane emissions of dairy cows. 
6.7 Future research 
The current study is the first study to investigate the use of home grown forages as 
potential options to reduce the requirement of purchased dietary protein whilst 
improving performance in high yielding dairy cows. Following the completion of 
three experiments, there are areas which have arisen as potential areas for future 
research in forage legumes and dairy cows. An area that the current studies did 
not investigate were the effects of condensed and hydrolysable tannins on the 
fermentation characteristics of the silage. Fermentation characteristics of silages 
are an important indicator of how the silage has fermented and preserved during 
the ensiling process. These characteristics indicate the quality of the silage thus 
have the potential to influence DM intake and milk yield of dairy cows. Therefore, 
future research is required to further demonstrate the effects of hydrolysable and 
condensed tannins on the fermentation profile of forage legumes.  
In a commercial setting, the current method of application and mixing of tannins to 
silage is not viable so tannins would not be considered an option at ensiling. The 
similarities in tannin concentrations measured in silages with or without added 
tannin in experiment 3 in the current study, suggests that future research is 
required to determine whether / how tannins can be applied to the forage and 
mixed with the forage at ensiling to ensure an even spread of tannins throughout 
the clamp. Many studies have considered the use of tannins at feed out as the 
application can be through the mixer wagon at the mixing stage of the dietary 
ingredients of the TMR. Therefore, a comparison study between supplementation 
of tannins at ensiling or feed out may be a future study to investigate the optimal 
way of adding tannins to the diet of high yielding dairy cows. Furthermore, to 
investigate the effectiveness of tannin application, further work is required on the 
butanol-HCl assay for determining tannin content in forages as it has been 
observed in Broadhurst and Jones, (1978) that the assay is sensitive to light and 
temperature thereby influencing the result.  
The structure of condensed and hydrolysable tannins vary thus having the 
potential to influence the binding strategies of these tannins in forage legumes. 
These binding strategies can impact the digestion of feed and nutritive value of the 
feed that the ruminant is able to utilise (Gerlach et al., 2018). In feeding studies, 
the structure of tannins is often not studied therefore future research may provide 
a better knowledge and understanding of how tannin structure is influencing the 
effects of tannin on ruminant performance. There are many methods that can used 
when measuring condensed and hydrolysable tannins, these methods include a 
variety of chemical, biochemical or biological assays (Mueller-Harvey, 2001; 
Schofield et al., 2001). However, currently there is a lack of understanding of 
tannin structure making it difficult to recommend one particular method, therefore it 
has been suggested that a mixture of methods should be used until knowledge of 
tannin structure is improved allowing for specific analytical methods to be 
developed (Mueller-Harvey, 2001; Schofield et al., 2001). 
The results of experiments 1 and 3 in the current study and from other published 
studies (Tabacco et al., 2006) suggest that future research is required to discover 
the optimum level of condensed or hydrolysable tannin added to forage legumes 
at ensiling to optimise dairy cow milk production and nitrogen use. Very few 
studies have investigated the effects of addition of tannins at ensiling due to the 
impractical methods of application limiting studies to focus on mini silos rather than 
commercial sized silos. Therefore, studies have focussed on the addition of 
tannins at feed out to investigate effects on cow performance. Experiment 3 and 
recent research by Gerlach et al. (2018) observed no effect of the inclusion of 
condensed or hydrolysable tannins up to 30 g/kg DM. It has been suggest that 
higher levels of condensed tannin above 30 g/kg DM have a detrimental effect on 
DM intake and milk yield which agrees with the results of experiment 2 on forage 
pea silages containing levels of condensed tannin averaging 62.9 g/kg DM. 
Therefore, results from the current study and previous studies suggest that future 
research needs to focus on discovering the optimal level of condensed or 
hydrolysable tannin between 30 and 60 g/kg DM in the diet of high yielding dairy 
cows to determine what level has a beneficial effect on cow performance.  
6.8 Conclusion 
In conclusion, the presence of either naturally occurring or supplemented 
condensed or hydrolysable tannins has had varying effects on nutritive value of 
forage legumes and performance of high yielding dairy cows. Nutritive value of 
forage legumes was found to be determined by the species of forage whilst tannin 
type or inclusion have very little influence on nutritive value post ensiling. The 
inclusion of tannins at varying rates to forage legumes did not change CP contents 
suggesting that the quantity of RUP available in the silo or rumen remained 
unaltered. Dairy cows fed forage pea silages had reduced DM intakes and milk 
yields, whereas dairy cows fed lucerne silage had a higher DM intake than cows 
fed red clover silage although there was no forage effect on BCS. Milk yield was 
unaffected by forage type or inclusion of tannin in cows fed lucerne or red clover 
silage. Digestibility of DM, OM or N were unaffected by the inclusion of forage 
peas, lucerne and red clover silages in the diet of dairy cows. Similarly, the 
inclusion of condensed or hydrolysable tannin in the diet had no influence on 
digestibility. Therefore, the inclusion of condensed or hydrolysable tannins in the 
diet of high yielding dairy cows have no influence on performance, whereas the 
type of forage has a varied effect on performance. A commercial advantage of 
using home grown forage legumes would be savings in nitrogen from fertilisers. 
Forage legumes have no requirement of fertilisers during growth and 
establishment due to the presence of nitrogen fixing bacteria within the root 
nodules. Through this system, nitrogen can be transferred from the forage legume 
to the next crop in the crop rotation reducing the use of fertilisers. A second 
commercial advantage would be the reduction in use of purchased dietary protein 
by the high yielding dairy cow as forage legumes in the current study reduced the 
quantity of soyabean meal used in the diet. Therefore, requirement for purchased 
dietary protein will be reduced but performance of a high yielding dairy cow will not 
be improved by home grown forages, whilst tannins will have little effect on milk 
performance.
