Abstract
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, at which protons collide at un-
precedented center of mass energies and very high instantaneous luminosity, gives
unique possibilities for precise tests of the Standard Model and to search for new
physics phenomena. A precise prediction of the processes at the LHC is essential
and the knowledge of the parton density functions (PDFs) of the proton plays a
key role in this.
In this thesis, three analyses covering different aspects of the Drell-Yan process
are presented. In the first analysis a new heavy neutral gauge boson, a so-called
Z  boson, is searched for. Those new gauge bosons are predicted by some theo-
ries extending the Standard Model gauge group to solve some of its conceptual
problems. Decays of the Z  boson in final states with a lepton (` = e, ) and
the corresponding anti-lepton are considered. The data in use were collected by
the ATLAS experiment in the year 2015+2016 at a center of mass energy of
13 TeV. The collected data corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb1.
The Standard Model prediction for the expected background is estimated with
Monte Carlo simulations and methods based on data. The resulting spectrum of
the di-lepton invariant mass is tested, using statistical methods, for differences
between data and the Standard Model predictions. No significant deviation from
the Standard Model predictions is found. Much more stringent limits have been
set on the parameters of interest for various models comparing with the Run 1
results. For new gauge bosons, Z SSM , Z
 and Z
 predicted in extended gauge
theory models, the observed lower limits on mass have been set to be 4.5 TeV,
4.1 TeV and 3.8 TeV at 95% confidence level, respectively. While for the Contact
Interactions, the observed lower limits on the corresponding energy scale  are
set between 24 TeV and 40 TeV depending on the different scenarios.
In the second analysis, the double-differential cross section measurement of the
process pp  Z/  `+` at a center of mass energy of
s = 8 TeV is used
in a PDF fit to put constraints on the photon PDF of the proton. The analysed
data were recorded by the ATLAS experiment in the year 2012 and correspond
to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb1. These data are sensitive to the photon
structure of the photon and allow a determination of x(x,Q2) with uncertainties
at the 30% level for 0.02  x  0.1. The results of this study, is in agreement
and exhibit smaller PDF uncertainties that the only other existing photon PDF fit
from LHC data, the NNPDF3.0QED analysis, based on previous LHC Drell-Yan
measurements. The results are also in agreement within uncertainties with two
recent theoretical calculations of the photon PDF, LUXqed and HKR16.
In the third analysis, a measurement of the double-differential Drell-Yan cross
section in the di-muon channel is presented differentially in terms of di-muon
invariant mass and double differentially in terms of di-muon invariant mass and
rapidity. The cross sections are measured using 3.2 fb1 of ATLAS data taken dur-
ing 2015 at a centre of mass energy of
s = 13 TeV. Dedicated studies to address the
main challenges of the analysis, namely the understanding of the trigger SF and
of the muon isolation are reported, and the data-driven methods for estimating
the QCD/multijet background are described in detail. The extracted fiducial cross
sections agree within uncertainties with the theoretical predictions from Powheg
interfaced with the Pythia v8.1 parton shower program.
Finally, due to the page limit in this thesis, my work for the ATLAS Collaboration
is not presented because it was not strictly related to the physics covered here.
This work consists in six public (PUB) notes: two on the MC modelling of V +jets
processes [1, 2], three on the MC modelling of the tt+jets process (with particular
emphasis on the implementation of new NLO merging schemes in the ATLAS
software) [35] and one about the inclusion of tt data recorded by the ATLAS
detector at 8 TeV (both lepton+jets and di-lepton decay channels) in a combined
PDF fit, together with the ep deep inelastic scattering data from HERA and the
inclusive ATLASW and Z boson data recorder at 7 TeV [6]. During my PhD course
I got involved in other publications which are mentioned in Chapter 4.

surement uncertainties. The discrepancy observed in the 7-9 GeV
bin is probably due to the breakdown of the theory predictions,
given that the considered phase space is very tiny and close to the
cut imposed on the lepton pT . In addition to that, the invariant mass
range covered in the first bin probes the very high-pT tail and it
could be that NLO MC predictions do not reproduce kinematic
distributions so well, taking into account that the pT of the di-muon
system is much more greater than the invariant mass in this region. 208

Chapter1
Theory
This chapter introduces the theoretical background needed to understand
the measurements presented in this work and to put them into the context of
its potential theoretical impact. The first section describes the Standard Model
(description based on [7]), while an introduction to the physics of proton-proton
collision is discussed in the second section. Then the Drell-Yan (DY) process and
the impact of high- and low-mass DY measurements are highlighted in Sec. 1.3.
Finally, Sec. 1.4 presents the limitations of the SM and a brief introduction to the
beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics, with a particular emphasis on BSM
theories involving a neutral heavy gauge boson.
1.1 The Standard Model of Particle Physics
After years of theoretical studies and experimental research scientists have
come to the conclusion that the universe is constructed of a specific number of
elementary building blocks, which are governed by four fundamental forces. These
perceptions provide a deep insight into the structure of the micro cosmos and help
to achieve a better understanding of the construction and coherence of matter. The
Standard Model (SM) describes the interactions of the known fermionic matter
particles, quarks and leptons, via the strong, the electromagnetic and the weak
forces based on the principle of local gauge invariance, e.g. invariance under
phase transformations depending on the space-time coordinates. The gravitational
force is negligible in atomic and nuclear physics since quantum gravity effects are
expected to be comparable with the effects of the other interactions only at very
high energies at the Planck scale of  1019 GeV.
On the theoretical point of view, the SM is a quantum field theory that is described
by the group SU(3)C  SU(2)L  U(1)Y , which has 8 + 3 + 1 = 12 generators and
gauge fields: the electromagnetic and weak interactions [8, 9] are described by the
SU(2)LU(1)Y symmetry group, while SU(3)C is the symmetry group associated
to the strong interactions of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) [10]. A vector
boson is associated to each generator of the gauge symmetry groups of the SM
acting as mediator of the interaction: eight gluons are associated to the SU(3)C
color group and the W, Z and  are associated to the so-called electroweak

symmetry SU(2)L  U(1)Y (Tab. 1.1).
The particles, which are currently believed to be elementary, can be categorized
according to their spin S into fermions with half-integer spin, and bosons with
integer spin values. Fermions are further divided into leptons which do not interact
via the strong force and quarks which undergo strong interactions. Furthermore,
the fermions come in three different generations; there are always two different
flavours of leptons and quarks per generation which yields in total 12 fermions as
shown in Table 1.2. Each quark flavour is a colour triplet and carries electroweak
charges including electric charges of +2/3 and -1/3 for up-type and down-type
quarks respectively. Leptons are colourless and have electroweak charge; the
electrons, muons and taus leptons have electric charge equal to -1, while the
associated neutrinos (e,  and  ) are electrically neutral. The weak hypercharge
is +1/3 for both the up-type and down-type and it is -1 for both the electrons,
muons and taus and the associated neutrinos. Opposite sign electric charges
are carried by the respective anti-particles. The masses of the above-mentioned
particles are introduced without spoiling the electroweak gauge symmetry via the
mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking [11, 12], an additional complex scalar
field is required for this purpose and give rise to a new scalar particle, the Higgs
boson h, that interacts with other particles with a strength proportional to their
masses.
1.1.1 Electroweak Theory
The electroweak interaction is an unified description of the electromagnetic
and weak force of the SM of particle physics. Although the two interactions seem
to be different at low energies, beyond the unification energy of about 100 GeV,
1.1 The Standard Model of Particle Physics
they are merged together into one force.
From the mathematical point of view, this unification is accomplished under an
SU(2)L  U(1)Y non-abelian gauge symmetry. Y is the hyper-charge operator and
it is defined as Y = 2(Q T 3), where Q is the conserved charge. The weak isospin
operators T 1,2,3 are the generators of the SU(2)L symmetry. The corresponding
gauge bosons are three W bosons of the weak isospin from SU(2)L (namely, W 1,2,3 )
and they only couple to left-handed fermions, which are ordered in SU(2) doublets
(right-handed fermions are ordered in SU(2) singlets), while B is the gauge field
associated with the weak hyper-charge.
The Lagrangian of the electroweak theory is defined as follows:
L = iD 
  1
Tr(WW
) (1.1)
where the Dirac field of a spin-1/2 particle is represented by . The kinematic of
the fermion field  is described by the first term in the equation. Local invariance
under SU(2)L  U(1)Y symmetry transformation is ensured by introducing the
gauge covariant derivative
D =   igW aT a + igBY (1.2)
where W a (a = 1, 2, 3) and B represents the gauge fields; they are massless vector
fields and they are introduced when requiring Lorentz invariance, given the fact
that the induced symmetry would be violated by any mass term of the gauge field
introduced in the Lagrangian. In Eq. 1.1, g and g denote the gauge coupling of the
SU(2)L and the coupling constant of the U(1)Y group respectively.
The kinematics of the vector field B is described by the second term in Eq. 1.1,
where B represents the field strength tensor for the weak hypercharge field. This
quantity is gauge invariant and it is defined as
B = B  B (1.3)
Similarly, we can define the field strength tensor for the weak isospin field, adding
an additional term according to the self-interaction of the gauge fields,
W a = W
  W a + gfabcW bW c , (1.4)
where fabc are the structure constants defined by the commutation relation[
T a, T b
= ifabcT c. (1.5)
The gauge fields represents the W, Z and  bosons, which are the mediator of the
weak and electromagnetic interaction respectively. Gauge bosons and fermions
are predicted to be massless in order to preserve local gauge symmetry, but as you
can see in Table 1.2, there are experimental evidences that show that the masses of
W and Z are different from 0.
To resolve this issue, the mathematical concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking is
employed in order to acquire the weak bosons masses. This concept is employed
by the so-called Higgs Mechanism, which introduces a massive scalar boson field
1.1 The Standard Model of Particle Physics

corresponding to the Higgs boson.
The Higgs mechanism [14] postulates an additional doublet  of complex scalar
fields with the potential
V () = 2 + ()2,  > 0. (1.6)
This additional doublet has four degrees of freedom and its weak hypercharge is
chosen to be Y = +1 such that the lower component of the  doublet does not
carry any electric charge
. (1.7)
The Lagrangian for the Higgs sector is given by
LHiggs = (D)(D) V () (1.8)
which is invariant under SU(2)L  U(1)Y symmetry transformations. Depending
on the sign of 2, the minimum of the potential is found to be:
2  0 : V
= 0 |min|= 0 (1.9)
2 > 0 :
= 0 |min|=
(1.10)
The vacuum expectation value 0||0 vanishes in the first case and the ground
state of the Higgs field is symmetric under SU(2)LU(1)Y ; however, if 2 > 0, the
vacuum expectation value differs from 0 and, since no positive charged permanent
field is observed, the ground state must take the form
(1.11)
1.1 The Standard Model of Particle Physics
that violates the SU(2)L  U(1)Y symmetry. Therefore, three of the original four
degrees of freedom of the scalar field are absorbed as longitudinal polarization
states of the W and Z bosons, which in this way acquire their masses, while
the photon remain massless. The remaining degree of freedom corresponds to a
physical massive scalar particle, the Higgs boson. In Fig. 1.1 the form of the Higgs
potential in the Re(), Im() plane is displayed. Considering measurements of
the muon decay width , the vacuum expectation value can be constrained to
v  246 GeV. The fact that the ground state does not exhibit the same symmetry of
the Lagrangian shown in Eq. 1.8 is named spontaneous symmetry breaking.
The masses of the fermions can be generated by means Yukawa couplings to the
Higgs field  [15].
1.1.2 Quantum Chromodynamics
The Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of strong interactions
and is a non-abelian gauge theory with symmetry group SU(3)C . The interactions
between quarks and gluons are described by this theory. The particles affected by
the strong coupling require an additional charge to preserve the Pauli principle
in QCD. This property, called colour, is the QCD analogue of the electric charge
in QED. Therefore, quarks and gluons have colour charge, which occurs in red,
green and blue. In order to compensate for the local gauge transformations, eight
additional fields, which are associated to eight gluons, must be included into
the QCD Lagrangian. As already shown in Eq. 1.1, these additional fields are
incorporated in the QCD Lagrangian via the covariant derivativeD. So, in analogy
to the electroweak theory, the gauge invariant QCD Lagrangian can be written as
follows:
LQCD = 
GaG
qfi (i
D mf ) qfi (1.12)
where the sums run over the quark flavours Nf and all colour states Nc. In Eq. 1.12,
qfi represents the quark fermion field. The first term in Eq 1.12 is also called
Yang-Mills term and describes the dynamics of the gluon fields A
LYM = 
GaG
. (1.13)
The symbol Ga , represents the gauge invariant gluon field strength tensor and it
is analogous to the electromagnetic field strength tensor, W (Eq. 1.4)
Ga = G
  Ga + gfabcGbGc , (1.14)
where fabc are the structure constants of SU(3)C .
QCD enjoys two peculiar properties:
 Confinement, which means that the force between quarks does not diminish
as they are separated. They are thus forever bound into hadrons such as the
proton and the neutron or the pion and kaon. Confinement is seen at large
distance e.g. small scale.
1.2 Proton-Proton collisions
 Asymptotic freedom, which means that interactions between particles be-
come asymptotically weaker as the energy scale increases and the corre-
sponding length scale decreases. This prediction of QCD was first discovered
in the early 1970s by David Politzer, Frank Wilczek and David Gross [16].
The strength of the strong force is represented by S and it can be expressed as
, (1.15)
where gS represents the QCD gauge coupling. This definition is analogous to that
of the QED fine structure constant
EW =
, (1.16)
where e is the electron charge. From experiments it has been found that S exhibits
a different behaviour in the low and high energy regime. Due to its dependence
on the energy scale it has acquired the name running coupling. The expression of
S at Leading Order (LO) is [17]
(33 2Nf ) ln(
2QCD
, (1.17)
QCD indicated the QCD scale and it has been experimentally determined to be
QCD  200 MeV. In high energy collisions, the production process depends on
the hard scale Q2. In the limit of asymptotic freedom, when the coupling constant
is very small and tends to be 0 e.g. S(Q2  )  0, the cross section can be
expanded perturbatively in powers of S . In the limit of confinement, S(Q2 
2QCD) e.g. by separating a quark anti-quark pair, the strong force becomes
so large that new qq pairs can be produced. In Fig. 1.2 we summarize recent
experimental determinations of the QCD running coupling S(Q) for different
scales, together with the several theoretical prediction. Asymptotic freedom can
be seen by the fact that S(Q) decreases when Q is increased.
1.2 Proton-Proton collisions
The most powerful tests of perturbative QCD (pQCD) are scattering experi-
ments.
QCD was first established and quantitatively tested studying Deep Inelastic Scat-
tering (DIS) at DIS experiments at SLAC and at collider experiments, such as
HERA, LEP and Tevatron. In particular, a three-jet event was first observed by
the TASSO experiment at the PETRA accelerator at the DESY laboratory and it
was the earliest and most direct evidence for the existence of gluons. A summary
of important results by the H1 and ZEUS Collaborations at HERA to test pQCD
can be found in [1824]. Drell-Yan lepton pair production cross sections were also
measured by the D0 and CDF Collaborations at the Tevatron and compared to

for QCD is presented in [27]. The experiments at CERNs Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) analyse processes at much more higher energy than in previous collider
experiments, to allow for a precise test of the theory.

tons interact inside the colliding hadrons are described by the so-called parton
model [28], introduced by R. Feynman in the early 70s.
1.2.1 The structure of the proton
Protons are baryons and therefore composite objects whose complicated dy-
namics cannot be calculated in the framework of QCD. This compositeness com-
plicates the description of a proton-proton collision with respect to a collision at a
lepton collider, where point-like particles collide. The constituents of the proton
are three valence quarks (uud) embedded in a sea of quark anti quark pairs (called
sea quarks) and gluons.
The main knowledge about the proton structure comes from lepton-proton scat-
tering experiments. A lepton probes a target proton via the exchange of an elec-
troweak boson (W/Z/). While elastic lepton-proton scattering allows to investi-
gate the electric and magnetic form factors associated with charge and the magnetic
distributions of the proton, the inner proton structure is studied by deep inelastic
scattering (DIS) experiments.
Let us recall that neutral current (NC) DIS is the scattering of a highly energetic
proton off a proton target
e(k) + p(p) e(k) +X (1.18)
1.2 Proton-Proton collisions
Fig. 1.3: The deep-inelastic scattering process in the QCD parton model.
where in general the proton will be destroyed by the collision (hence the name
"inelastic"). The four momentum transferred between the lepton and the proton is
q  k  k. (1.19)
The kinematics of the DIS process are completely specified by the following
variables
xBj 
2p  q , Q
2  q2, y  q  p
k  p. (1.20)
Here, xBj is usually known as the Bjorken variable. In order to differentiate the
inelastic scattering from the elastic one, the condition must be that Q2 M2p , else
the proton would not be destroyed. For instance, the center-of-mass energy of the
p  collision will be
W 2  (p+ q)2 = M2p +Q2
' Q2 1 x
, (1.21)
where Mp is the proton mass and it can typically be neglected in the above calcula-
tion.
Focusing on the neutral-current (NC) DIS process, the cross section for unpolarized
electron-proton scattering can be written as in the following:
d2NC
dxdQ2
[Y+F2  y2FL  YxF3] (1.22)
where Y = 1 (1 y)2 is the so-called inelasticity parameter, y = Q2/(sx) (with x
representing the Bjorken scaling variable and s the centre-of-mass energy) corre-
sponds to the relative energy loss of the lepton in the proton rest-frame and F2, F3
and FL are the generalized structure functions.
In the DIS process, the lepton probes a parton carrying a fraction x of the protons
momentum, with 0  x  1. The probability to find a given quark in the proton
1.2 Proton-Proton collisions
with a fraction x of the total proton momentum can be expressed in terms of
parton distribution functions (PDF), f(x,Q2). The PDFs are not predicted by the
parton model and they must be determined experimentally. The main source of
information about the proton structure come from the electromagnetic structure
function F2(x,Q2):
F2(x,Q
22EW (1 + (1 y)2)
d2DIS
dxdQ2
(1.23)
where DIS is the DIS lepton-proton cross-section. In the parton model, the struc-
ture function has a relatively simple expression as a convolution between the
q  X partonic cross-section and the PDFs,
F2(x,Q
fq(z)qX(
), (1.24)
which importantly does not depend on the scale Q2. At LO, Eq. 1.24 can be written
F2(x,Q
flavours
qi(x,Q
2) + qi(x,Q
, (1.25)
with qi, qi respectively the quark and antiquark distributions in the proton.
1.2.2 Factorisation theorem and total cross section in hadron col-
lisions
In order to calculate the cross section of a QCD process, the collinear factorisa-
tion theorem [29] can be used. The main idea is to separate the non-perturbative
long-distance interactions, such as PDFs, hadronisation, and multiple soft inter-
actions, and the perturbatively calculable short-distance interactions. This part,
calculable with perturbative QCD, is given by the partonic cross section  includ-
ing QCD radiation. The long-distance contributions cannot be computed precisely
in pQCD and are described by phenomenological models [30]. In the low energy
(or long distances) regime, one encounters infrared (IR) divergences in the limit
Q 0, as well as ultraviolet (UV) divergences in the limit Q. The IR diver-
gences are absorbed in the definition of the PDFs which thus acquire a dependence
on the so-called factorisation scale, F . Similarly, the UV divergences are absorbed
by the renormalisation procedure in the strong coupling constant definition, which
acquire a dependence on the renormalisation scale, R. Both these two quantities
are not physical so observable quantities should not depend on R and F . The
requirement leads to the so-called renormalisation group equations
dF,R
= 0. (1.26)
The cross section for quark annihilation into a virtual photon or Z can be written
as [30]
pp =
dx1dx2fq(x1, 
F )fq(x2
F )qq`+` (1.27)
1.2 Proton-Proton collisions
Fig. 1.4: Splitting functions at LO.
where qq`+` represents the hadronic cross section for qq  `+` and the sum
runs over all the quarks and anti-quarks combinations. The cross section of the
hard process can be written as a perturbative expansion of the strong coupling
constant S
qq`+` =
LO(R, F ) + S(
RNLO(F , R)) + ...
qq`+` (1.28)
Typically, these calculations retain only a finite number of terms in the perturba-
tive expansion, so they display a residual dependence on F and R. Therefore,
these scales have to be chosen, in order to perform perturbative calculations. To
avoid large logarithms in the perturbation series, factorisation scales are usually
equalised to the same order of magnitude as the momentum scale of the hard
scattering Q2.
Given their scale dependence, PDFs can be propagated from a defined scale Q20
to an higher scale Q2 > Q20 using the Dokshittzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi
(DGLAP) parton evolution equation [3133]
fi(x,Q
, S(Q
fj(,Q
2). (1.29)
The LO DGLAP splitting functions Pij(0) represent the probability of a parton
j, with momentum fraction , emitting a parton and becoming parton i with a
momentum fraction x.
The LO splitting functions shown in Fig. 1.4 are defined as follows:
P 0qq(z) =
1 + z2
1 z , P
qg(z) =
(z2 + (1 z)2), (1.30)
P 0gq(z) =
1 + (1 z)2
, P 0gg(z) = 2Nc
1 z  2 + z(1 z)
. (1.31)
In the above-described equations, z is defined as x/ and Nc = 3 represents the
number of colour states.
So, while the Q2 dependence of the PDFs is described by the DGLAP equations,
the full x dependency of the PDFs cannot be predicted. Thus this dependency
has to be extracted from global QCD fits to several measurements. In general the
QCD fits are obtained by parametrising the parton distribution functions at a
starting scale Q20 using an analytical form. The generic functional form used for
parametrising the quark and gluon distributions is
F (x,Q20) = A  xB(1 x)CP (x;D,E, ...), (1.32)
1.2 Proton-Proton collisions

Fig. 1.5: PDFs for quarks, anti-quarks and gluons for energy scale Q2 = 10 GeV2 (a) and Q2

where the parameters B and C are physically motivated: the former is associated
to the behaviour in the small-x region, while the latter is associated to the large-x
behaviour. However, they are not sufficient enough to describe either quark or
gluon distributions; that is why the term P (x;D,E, ...) is introduced, in order
to add more flexibility in the functional form. Additional constraints are also
included, such as the momentum sum rule
i=q,q,g
dxxfi(x) = 1, (1.33)
which translates the fact that the total momentum of the proton is distributed
among all the quarks and gluons, and the valence sum rules 1
dx(fu(x) fu(x)) = 2, (1.34)
dx(fd(x) fd(x)) = 1, (1.35) 1
dx(fs(x) fs(x)) = 0. (1.36)
which ensure that the proton has the correct flavour quantum numbers. Once
the PDFs are parametrised at Q20, they are evolved in Q
2 and convoluted with
the partonic cross section to predict a cross section which can be compared to
the actual measurements. For the measured and calculated cross sections a 2
function is calculated. The starting parameters are now deduced by minimizing
the 2. Once these parameters are determined, the PDFs can, starting from the
1.2 Proton-Proton collisions
parametrization scale, be evolved to any Q2 using the DGLAP equations. Fig. 1.5
shows the PDFs of the partons at two different energy scales Q2 = 10 GeV2 (left)
and Q2 = 104 GeV2 (right), calculated from fits to H1 and ZEUS data.
The uncertainties of the extracted PDFs correspond to the experimental uncer-
tainties of the measurements used for the global fit. These uncertainties can be
propagated to uncertainties on the deduced PDF parameters. Given the fact that
some of these parameters can be highly correlated, the propagation of these uncer-
tainties on PDFs cannot be done straight forward.
There are two main approaches for estimating the uncertainties associated with
the fit, namely the Monte Carlo Replicas method and the Hessian method.
The Monte Carlo Replicas method is a common method used for calculating
PDF uncertainties; for example, it is largely used by the NNPDF group. Here, for
each of the n experimental measurements, d Monte Carlo (MC) replicas are created
such that any sufficiently large number of them has the same mean, variance
and covariance as the experimental measurement [35]. Then, a PDF can be fitted
for each of the MC replicas, with the best fit being the average of the obtained
fits; the uncertainty associated with this fit is taken as the variance between the
fits. This method can be used with any parametrisation of the PDFs and and it is
very handy when fitting parametrisation characterized by a large number of free
parameters. These above-described replicas comprise systematic uncertainties as
well as statistical errors.
The Hessian Method In this method [3638] the n n covariance matrix (with
n parameters) is build for the up and down variation of the parameters by either
68% or 90% confidence level (CL). This matrix can be rotated into an orthogonal
eigenvector basis. The result are 2n eigenvector sets, one for the up variation and
the other for the down variation, which allow the uncorrelated propagation of the
fit uncertainties. These eigenvector sets for up (X+i ) and down (X
i ) variation can
be then combined to an asymmetric uncertainty X+i and X
i on the PDF or on
an observable using the PDF with the following formula:
X+i =
 2n
[max(X+i X0, Xi X0, 0)]2 (1.37)
Xi =
 2n
[max(X0 X+i , X0 Xi , 0)]2, (1.38)
where X0 represents the central value and X
i and X
i the up and down variation
of source i, respectively. X+i adds in quadrature the PDF uncertainty contri-
butions which lead to an increase of a given observable X, while Xi the PDF
uncertainty contributions which lead to a decrease. Large asymmetries in the PDF
uncertainties are indicative of a problem with the fit.
1.3 The Drell-Yan process
Fig. 1.6: Feynman diagram of the Drell-Yan process. The four-momenta of the protons are
defined as P1,2, giving the four-momenta of the partons initiating the hard scattering with
p1,2, depending on the momentum fractions x1,2.
1.3 The Drell-Yan process
The neutral-current (NC) Drell-Yan process is the dominant mechanism of Z
boson production at the LHC. It was first described by Sidney Drell and Tung-Mow
Yan [39] in 1970 and it consists in the production of a lepton pair `+` at a hadron
collider by quark-antiquark annihilation with invariant mass M2 = (p`+ + p`)2 
1 GeV2. Fig. 1.6 illustrates the leading order process as a Feynman diagram.
Let us take a closer look at the kinematics of this process. The kinematics of
vector-boson production is hadronic collisions can be written as follows:
p1 = (x1
2/2, 0, 0, x1
2/2), (1.39)
p2 = (x2
2/2, 0, 0,x2
2/2), (1.40)
q = ((x1 + x2)
2/2, 0, 0, (x1  x2)
2/2), (1.41)
with p1,2 the four-momenta of the incoming partons and q = p1 + p2 the four-
momentum of the gauge boson. In this process, the kinematics is fixed once the
gauge boson rapidity is specified. Indeed, the rapidity y of the Drell-Yan lepton
pair is defined as
E + px
E  pz
, (1.42)
where pz is the component of momentum along the beam axis and E represents
the total energy of the particle. As it is shown in Eq. 2.2, the rapidity can be written
in terms of momentum fractions x1 and x2. The kinematic relation of the rapidity
and the momentum faction x yields
e+y, x2 =
ey, (1.43)
1.3 The Drell-Yan process
Fig. 1.7: Kinematic relation between partonic quantities: momentum fraction x, hard scale
Q2 and the final-state quantities: invariant mass M and rapidity y, for center-of-mass
energy equal to 14 TeV. Figure taken from Ref. [30].
with M = Q, and it is illustrated for different invariant masses at
s = 14 TeV in
Fig. 1.7. Also shown are the regions of phase space accessible to each experiment.
Among the DIS experiments HERA has access to lower x and higher Q2, whereas
fixed target experiments probe lower Q2 and larger x. A broad range in both
variable, x and Q2, is covered by the LHC. So, the accessible rapidity range for the
production of a Z boson is determined by the available center-of-mass energy and
the Z mass value:
|yMAXZ |= ln
s TeV
(1.44)
Thus, for a center-of-mass energy of
s = 8TeV, the Z boson can be produced in the
rapidity range |yZ |  4.96, considering MZ = 91.1876 GeV (value taken Ref. [13]).
1.3.1 Leading Order Cross Section
The cross section for this process at leading order can easily be obtained from
the fundamental QED e+e  `+` cross section, with the addition of appropriate
1.3 The Drell-Yan process
color and charge factors
(qq    `+`) = 4
Q2q (1.45)
where s = M2`` is the squared center-of-mass energy of the incoming partons,
1/NC = 1/3 is a color factor, taking into account that only three colour combina-
tions are possible given the fact that the intermediate state has to be colorless and
Qq is the charge of the quarks.
Eq. 1.45 shows a strongly falling behaviour,   1/M2``. If M``  90 GeV, the pro-
cess take place via the exchange of a Z boson (namely, qq  Z  `+`), leading
to a Breit-Wigner resonance in the spectrum of the invariant mass. Once M`+` is
comparable to MZ , the two possible processes, the exchange of a virtual photon
and the exchange via a Z boson., interfere. Thus, the differential cross-section
distribution is considered. The sub-process cross section yields
dM2``
42EW
3M2``
Q2q( M2``). (1.46)
The differential cross section of the Drell-Yan process is now considered. In the
parton model [17] this is given by a convolution of this sub-process cross-section
and the parton densities as follows:
dM2``
dx1dx2
{fq(x1)fq(x2) + fq(x1)fq(x2)}

(1.47)
The sum runs over the quark flavours Nf and the dependence on the PDFs is
defined in the qq probability function Pqq(x1, x2) [40]. Multiplying Eq. 1.47 by M4``,
the lepton pair cross section can be written as a function of a dimensionless scaling

1.3.2 Perturbative QCD corrections to the Drell-Yan process
The source of higher order QCD corrections to the Drell-Yan section are ad-
ditional Feynman diagrams with additional s vertices. These additional terms

are represented by several Feynman diagrams and constitute real or virtual cor-
rections (see Fig. 1.8). Starting from Eq. 1.48, the LO partonic cross section can be
written as
dM2``
42EW
 F(), (1.49)
where
F() = Q2q(1 ). (1.50)
In pQCD, the F() can be expanded in powers of s
F() = F0() +
F1() +
F2() + ... (1.51)
The corrections at NLO (O(s)) to Drell-Yan process are illustrated in Fig. 1.8.
Fig. 1.8 (a) and (b) show the virtual corrections, while the real gluon emission
producing a gluon in the final state is shown in Fig. 1.8 (c); finally Fig. 1.8 (d) and
1.3 The Drell-Yan process
(e) show the q(q) g scattering process which produces an additional parton in
the final state along with the Drell-Yan lepton pair.
The real and loop corrections in the cross section calculation introduce divergences
of different types, which can be divided as follows:
 Infrared (IS) divergences from real and virtual contributions due to soft-gluon
emissions;
 Ultraviolet (UV) divergences from loop diagram, when the energy of the
emitted parton tends to infinity;
 Collinear divergences,which are induced by parton splitting of the initial-state
partons.
The IR singularities can be regulated by combining the contributions from real and
and virtual diagrams in the calculation, while the UV divergences are treated with
renormalisation. Several types of regularisation scheme could be used, such as
the massive gluon scheme and the dimensional regularisation [40]. In the massive
gluon scheme, the real and virtual corrections are regularised by introducing a
mass for the gluon. As regards the dimensional regularisation, the integration
variables in space-time dimensions are changed from 4 to 4 -  and a renormali-
sation scale R is introduced. The NLO Drell-Yan cross section measurement as
a function of the invariant mass of the di-lepton pair (Q2 = M``) at 13 TeV can
be found in Fig. 1.9, showing different contributions of the , Z and interference
terms. NNLO (O(s)) corrections can also be computed and they include diagrams
with loops which produce qq pairs [4143]. Furthermore, theoretical calculations of
the Drell-Yan cross-section can be performed at NLO matched to leading-log (LL)
and next-to-leading-log (NLL) calculations, to take into account soft and collinear
partonic emissions [4447].
1.3.3 The photon-induced contribution
So far we have only discussed the production of di-lepton pairs `+` via the
Drell-Yan process. The quarks in the proton carry electric charges themselves and
hence they can radiate photons, not only gluons. This means that there is also a
photonic structure besides the partonic structure of the proton. These photons can
also produce lepton pairs, via the so-called photon-induced (PI) process. Fig. 1.10
shows the LO Feynman diagrams which contribute to lepton pair production. The
left diagram corresponds to the u-channel diagram, while the right diagram to the
t-channel diagram. The PI process does not have a s-channel diagram at LO and
therefore it has different kinematic properties than the Drell-Yan process: indeed,
the photon induced process has a higher contribution at small angles with respect
to the direction of the incoming photons.
The photon contribution can be accounted for by introducing a photon PDF and
evolving it in Q2 with modified DGLAP equations, which take into account higher
order electro-weak corrections. Many of the standard PDF sets in use at the LHC do
not include this photon contribution. The first PDF set which included this photon-
induced contribution was MRST2004QED [48]. The modern PDFs which also take

theoretical calculations, LUXqed [52,53] and HKR16 [54] (see Chapter 4 for a more
detailed explanation). As it will be discussed later, the -initiated contribution
becomes a significant part of the di-lepton production at high invariant masses. The
knowledge of this process is therefore an important input for analyses searching
for a heavy resonance decaying into lepton pairs.
1.4 Precision tests and limitations of the SM
The SM has been successfully tested in a large variety of experiments over a
wide range of energies during the last 40 years. Precision tests of the electroweak
interaction performed at LEP or Tevatron accelerators confirmed that the couplings
of quark and leptons to the Z and W bosons agree with the the ones predicted by
the SM; in addition to that fact, other experimental results, e.g. measurements of
weak hadrons decays, provide additional tests of the SM at low energies. Moreover,
the QCD sector was first established by the observation of scaling violations in
DIS experiments and then many precision DIS measurements followed. The recent
discovery, at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), of a Higgs boson with a mass
equal to  125 GeV [55, 56] is the latest success of the SM, for two reasons:
 The measured mass is in agreement with the allowed range from the com-
bined measurement of electroweak observables [57];

surements performed by the ATLAS Collaboration at different center-of-mass
energy is shown in Fig. 1.11.
In spite of this success, the SM is widely believed to be an effective theory valid
only for energies up to the electroweak scale. In addition to the fact that the SM
does not include the gravitational force, this theory does not explain the pattern
of fermion masses and does not allow for neutrino masses; thus these and other
deficiencies indicate the need for new physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM).
Some of the most relevant deficiencies are listed in the following:
1.4.1 Dark Matter
Astrophysical data indicates the existence of non-baryonic, weakly interacting
and neutral matter of unknown composition, so-called Dark Matter. Supersym-
metry, an extension of the Standard Model that postulates the existence of an
additional symmetry between fermions and bosons, increases the number of
particles and naturally proposes possible dark matter candidates.
1.4.2 Grand Unification Problem
Embedding the SM in a more fundamental framework is theoretically very
appealing. The unification of the symmetry structure of the SM into a larger
symmetry group leads to the formulation of Grand Unification Theories (GUT).
Below some energy scale the generic theory could be broken into the symmetry
group of the SM which is then interpreted as an effective low energy limit of the
larger theory. An indication for this is given by the running couplings which may
meet at a scale of  1015 GeV. The scale dependence is affected by the possible
existence of supersymmetric particles. For masses of supersymmetric particles in
the range of 1 - 10 TeV an unification of all three coupling constants at GUT  1016
GeV could be achieved thanks to some extended BSM theory [58].
1.4.3 Hierarchy and Fine-Tuning Problems
Radiative corrections to the bare Higgs boson mass squared (m2h) diverge
quadratically with the cut-off energy scale, , which represents the energy scale up
to which the SM is expected to be valid [59]. Putting in the GUT scale GUT  1016
GeV where new physics is expected to show up, would require a severe fine-tuning
of order of (v/1015)2 = O(1026) which seems unnatural. Supersymmetry can
provide a solution to the hierarchy problem as each fermion has a bosonic partner
yielding the same correction but with opposite sign. Therefore, the cancellation
of higher order correction terms would be exact and automatic (this statement
is only true for an exact Supersymmetry which implies that all SM particles and
their supersymmetric partners have the same mass).
1.5 New physics processes involving charged lepton pairs in the final state
1.5 New physics processes involving charged lepton
pairs in the final state
In the following section, we introduce some models which lead to a signature
in the final state containing a charged lepton pair (`+` = e+e, +).
1.5.1 Neutral Heavy Gauge Boson
The benchmark model forZ  bosons is the Sequential Standard Model (SSM) [60];
in this model, the Z  (Z SSM ) has the same quantum numbers and couplings to
fermions as the SM Z boson and no couplings to the W and Z bosons. The Z 
boson is hence a copy of the SM Z boson, only with a higher mass and width. A
more theoretically-motivated model is a Grand Unification model in which the
E6 gauge group is broken into SU(5) and two additional U(1) groups [61]. The
lighest linear combination of the corresponding two new neutral gauge bosons, Z 
and Z , is considered the Z
 candidate: Z (e6) = Z
 cos(E6) + Z
 cos(E6), where
  e6 <  is the mixing angle between the two gauge bosons. The pattern of
spontaneous symmetry breaking and the value of E6 determine the Z
 couplings
to fermions. Six different models [60,61] lead to the specific Z  states named Z , Z
Z , Z
I , Z
S and Z
, respectively. In all the above-described models, the resonances
are assumed to have a narrow instrinsic width, meaning that exclusion limits
extracted for the widest signal shape can also be used to infer corresponding limits
on the other models considered. The expected instrinsic width of the Z SSM as a
fraction of the mass is 3.0%, while for any E6 model the intrinsic width is predicted
to be between 0.5% and 1.2% [62]. The LO cross-section times the branching ratio
to a single di-lepton flavour for various Z  models versus polemass at
s= 13 TeV
is shown in Fig. 1.12.
In the Minimal Z  models [63], the phenomenology is controlled by only two ef-
fective coupling constants in addition to the Z  boson mass. This parameterization
encompasses many models, including a left-right symmetric model [64, 65] and
the pure (B - L) model [66], where B (L) is the baryonic (leptonic) number, and B -
L is the conserved quantum number.
Previous direct searches for a Z  have been carried out at the Tevatron experi-
ments [67, 68] and indirect constraints from LEP [6972] have resulted in limits
on the Z SSM mass of 1.07 TeV [68] and 1.79 TeV [73] respectively. Searches have
also been performed by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations [74,75]. The strongest
ATLAS exclusion limits for the Z SSM come from the latest search conducted by
the ATLAS Collaboration using 3.2 fb1 of pp collision data at
s = 13 TeV [76].
That combined analysis of the di-electron and di-muon channels set lower limits at
95% credibility level (C.L.) on the Z SSM pole mass of 3.36 TeV. The CMS exclusion
limits for this search in 2015 are very similar to the one found by ATLAS.
1.5.2 Contact Interactions
The presence of a new interaction can be detected at an energy much lower
than that required to produce direct evidence of the existence of a new gauge

boson. The charged weak interaction responsible for nuclear  decay provides
such an example. A non-renormalizable description of this process was succefully
formulated by Fermi in the form of a four-fermion contatc interaction [77]. A
contact interaction can also accomodate deviations from the SM in proton-proton
scattering due to quark and lepton compositeness, where a characteristic energy
scale  corresponds to the binding energy between fermion constituents. A new
interaction or compositeness in the process qq  `+` can be described by the
following four-fermion contact interaction Lagrangian [78, 79]
L = g2/2[LL(qLqL)(lLlL)
+ RR(qRqR)(lR
+ LR(qLqL)(lR
+ RL(qRqR)(lL
lL)],
(1.52)
where g is a coupling constant chosen by convention in order to satisfy g2/4 = 1, 
is the contact interaction scale, and qL,R and lL,R are left-handed and right-handed
quark and lepton fields, respectively. The parameters i,j , where i and j and L or
R (left or right), define the chiral structure of the new interaction. Different chiral
structures could be investigated, with the left-right model obtained by setting LR
=  1 and RL = RR = LL = 0. Likewise, the left-left, the right-left and the right-
right models are obtained by setting the corresponding parameters to 1, and the
others to zero. The sign of ij determines whether the interference is constructive
(ij = 1) or destructive (ij = +1). The cross-section for the process qq  `+` is
the presence of these contact interaction models can be written as:
tot(m``) = DY (m``) ij

where the first term accounts for the qq  Z/  `+` SM DY process (see
Fig. 1.13), the second term corresponds to the interference between the DY and
CI processes, and the third term describes the pure CI process. These two latter
terms include FI and FC , respectively, which are functions of the differential cross-
section with respect to m``, and do not depend on . The relative impact of the
interference and pure CI terms depends on both the di-lepton invariant mass
and . Previous searches for CI have been carried out in the neutrino-nucleus
and electron-electron scattering [80], as well as electron-positron [72, 81], electron-
proton [82], and proton-proton colliders [83, 84]. Searches for CI have also been
performed by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations [75,85]. The strongest exclusion
limits for ``qq CI in which all quarks flavours contribute come from the latest
ATLAS non-resonant dilepton analysis conducted using data recorded during
2015+2016 pp collision at
s = 13 TeV [76, 86]. These two searches are part of my
thesis work and their results will be described later in Chapter 5.

The Large Hadron Collider and the
ATLAS experiment
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the largest energy particle accelerator ever
built. It is a project developed by the European Organization for Nuclear Research
(CERN). The main objective of this collider is the investigation of the nature of
electroweak symmetry breaking, to measure the properties of the Higgs boson
and the search for particles predicted by new physics models beyond Standard
Model (BSM) at the TeV scale.
2.1 General remarks
The LHC s a proton-proton (and heavy-ions) collider machine based at CERN
near Geneva. This machine uses the 26.7 km tunnel, located underground (between
50 m and 175 m depth), that was built between 1984 and 1989 for the Large Electron-
Proton Collider (LEP) machine. In 2000, LEP was decommissioned to give way
to the LHC. During the years of ATLAS data taking it has worked at increasing
energies, starting from the center of mass energy of 7 TeV in 2011 to 13 TeV from
2015 till 2018.1
The LHC, pictured in Fig. 2.1, is designed to deliver proton and ion beam collisions
to four main experiments: the two multipurpose detectors ATLAS (A Toroidal Lhc
ApparatuS) [87] and CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) [88], LHCb (LHC beauty
experiment) [89] focusing on b-physics and ALICE (A Lhc Ion Collider Experiment)
[90] focusing on heavy-ions physics.
Before being injected into the LHC, the particles are accelerated step by step up to
the injection energy of 450 GeV, by a series of accelerators shown in Fig. 2.1. For
protons, the first system is a linear accelerator (LINAC2), which accelerates the
beam at an energy of 50 MeV. The protons then go through the Proton Synchrotron
Booster (PSB) and are brought to 1.4 GeV. After that they are injected into the
Proton Synchrotron (PS), where they are accelerated to 26 GeV. Finally, the Super

data analysed in this thesis were collected.

Proton Synchrotron (SPS) is used to further increase their energy to 450 GeV. From
the SPS, two transfer lines inject the proton beams into the LHC.

  is the RMS of the beam size at the interaction point.
All these parameters have been optimized to ensure maximal luminosity. Table 2.1
highlights the typical values of representative beam parameters under operational
conditions of the LHC in pp collision mode in Run 1 from 2010 to 2012 and in Run
2 from 2015 to 2016. In 2016, the peak luminosity is up to 1.4  cm2 s1 which
has surpassed the design value.
The numbers of events generated for a specific process can be written as Nevent =
event  L  A  , where event represents the cross section of the considered process,
L dt is the luminosity, integrated over time, provided by the machine, A is
the geometrical acceptance and  the efficiency of the detector. Since the intent of
the LHC is to explore physics which has not been seen so far, the cross section of
interesting processes will be very small and thus the luminosity must be maximal.
In Fig. 2.2 the cross section for different processes as a function of the center of
mass energy is presented.

2.3 LHC parameters and operation
The LHC design value for instantaneous luminosity in proton-proton collisions
at centre-of-mass energy
s = 14 TeV is L = 1034 cm2 s1. With this configura-
tion there are an average of about 23 inelastic scatterings per 25 ns bunch crossing,
in which nearly 1000 new particles are produced.
The first beam circulated in the LHC on September 10th, 2008. Nine days later
an incident was caused by a faulty electrical connection between two magnets
during powering tests of the main dipole circuit. Helium leakage into the tunnel
and serious mechanical damage delayed the operations by about a year. In order
to prevent this from happening again, the center of mass energy has been reduced
to 7 TeV for the data taking periods of 2010 and 2011, while in 2012 the machine
was running at
s = 8 TeV. During the LHC Run 1 in 2011 and 2012 and Run
2 in 2015 and 2016, the operation of ATLAS detector ensures a high data taking
efficiency of about 93%. Fig 2.3 shows the integrated luminosity delivered by the

bunch increases the number of events of interest but, on the other hand, it increases
also the number of pile-up events; pile-up is a challenge for the detectors and for
the acquisition and analysis of the data. In particle physics, pile-up refers to the
situation several collisions are recorded in the same 25 ns bunch crossing. The
pile-up events can be generated both by the superimposition of particles interac-
tions coming from previous or following bunch crossing (out-of-time pile-up) or by
different interactions in the considered bunch crossing (in-time pile-up). Because
of the pile-up, the mean number of interactions for bunch crossing increases, and
thus the detector must be able to separate particles from multiple simultaneous
interactions. The distribution of the mean number of interaction for bunch cross-
ing are shown in Fig. 2.4 for both 2011-2012 (left plot) and 2015-2016 (right plot)
data taking [92, 93]. In the end, Fig. 2.5 shows the peak instantaneous luminosity
delivered to ATLAS during stable beams for pp collisions at 13 TeV centre-of-mass
energy for each LHC fill as a function of time in 2015 (left-hand side plot), as well
as in 2016 (right-hand side plot).
2.4 The ATLAS detector: a general overview
ATLAS is a general-purpose experiment, designed to cover the widest possible
range of physics at the LHC. The formal proposal for ATLAS was introduced in
1994 and 10 years later the detector installation in the cavern began. Around 3000
scientists from 177 institutes in 38 countries work on the ATLAS experiment. In
this chapter, the most important features of the ATLAS detector and of its trigger
system will be presented; a brief description of ATLAS software will follow. The
ATLAS detector is one of the four experiments working at the LHC at CERN; it has
been designed to look for the Higgs bosons and, in general terms, to investigate
the physics at the TeV energy scale. The ATLAS layout of the whole experiment
is similar to other general purpose high energy collider detector, with cylindrical
shape (to approach a 4 coverage) and layers of sub-detectors. A cut-away view
of the ATLAS detector, which has a length of 44 m, a diameter of 25 m and a

weight of, approximately, 7000 tonnes, is visible in Fig. 2.6. Driven by the physics
requirements, the detecting technologies are a precision tracking system (for mea-
suring the momentum of charged particles), calorimeters (for the determination of
the energy of the electromagnetic and strongly interacting particles) and muon
chambers (for measuring the momentum of muons). Therefore, ATLAS consists
of three main subsystems: the tracking system, the electromagnetic and hadronic
calorimeters and the muon chambers; the central part around the beam line is
called the barrel and the wheels perpendicular to the beam axis in the forward
2.4 The ATLAS detector: a general overview
parts are called end-caps. In the following, the description of the coordinate system
and of the magnets system is presented; later, the different sub-detectors will be
described.
2.4.1 Coordinate System
The coordinate system used in the ATLAS detector [94] is a right-handed
coordinate system and it is shown in Fig. 2.7. As it is possible to see, the beam

direction defines the z-axis and the x-y plane is transverse to the beam direction.
The positive x-axis is defined pointing to the centre of the LHC ring and the positive
y-axis is defined pointing upwards. The transverse energy ET and momentum pT
are defined in the x-y plane. As in all other experiments at a hadron collider, in
ATLAS cylindrical coordinates are used instead of xyz coordinates: in cylindrical
coordinates the azimuthal angle  is used and, instead of the polar angle , the
rapidity, defined in Eq. 2.2, for a massive particle, or pseudo-rapidity, defined in
Eq. 2.3, in case of the mass of the particle can be neglected.

(2.3)
2.4 The ATLAS detector: a general overview
This choice is driven by the fact that, at a hadron collider, the total momentum
of the initial system along the z-axis is unknown (since the collision takes place
between the partons, not at the proton level); for this reason, a quantity, i.e. the
difference of pseudorapidity of two particles, which does not depend on Lorentz
boosts along the beam axis is used. In the end, the distance in pseudorapidity-
azimuthal angle space is, in general, indicated using the R coordinate, defined
as follows:
2 + 2 (2.4)
Tracks of charged particles in ATLAS are parameterized with these five parameters:
 The transverse impact parameter d0, which is the distance to the beam axis
in the x-y plane.
 The longitudinal impact parameter z0, which is the distance to the coordinate
system origin in z-direction.
 The azimuthal angle , measured in the x-y plane.
 The polar angle .
 The charge of the particle divided by its momentum, q/p, which characterizes
the track curvature.
An illustration of the above-illustrated track parameters is shown in Fig. 2.8

ex, ey and ez represent the x-, y- and z-axis respectively.
2.4 The ATLAS detector: a general overview
2.4.2 Magnet System
In order to reconstruct the transverse momenta of all the charged particles
coming from the interaction point, a magnetic field is fundamental. The ATLAS
Magnet System is made up by superconducting magnets of three different kinds
[95] :
Central Solenoid
A solenoidal magnet is placed around the Inner Detector (ID) and it has been
designed to provide a magnetic field of  2 Tesla (T) along the beam axis
inside the ID [96]. Since it is placed before the electromagnetic (EM) calorime-
ter, the material budget has to be low in order to not distort measurement in
the calorimeter.
Barrel Toroid
The ATLAS Barrel Toroid systems consists of eight coils assembled radially
and symmetrically around the beam axis; the peak field provided by the
Barrel Toroid coils is 3.9 T, providing 2 to 6 Tm of bending power in the
pseudorapidity range from 0 to 1.3 (in other words, the central region of the
detector) [97].
Endcap Toroids
A toroidal field, provided by two air-core toroids, characterizes the exterior
region of the muon spectrometer [98]. It provides B  1.0 T inside the toroid
muon spectrometer.
A schematic view of the Magnetic System of the ATLAS Experiment is shown in Fig.
2.9. The magnetic field provided by the ATLAS Magnetic System is not completely

uniform, due to the complexity of the toroids; moreover, the superposition of the
magnetic fields of the barrel and endcap toroids originates the so-called "transition

region" (more precisely 1.3 < || < 1.6), where the bending power is so much
poorer.
2.4.3 Identifying particles with the ATLAS detector
The ATLAS detector has an onion-like structure; the purpose of this design is
to be able to discriminate between different type of particles that cross the detector.
An illustration of how the various particles are identified in the ATLAS detector is
given in Fig. 2.10. Charged particles, curved by the magnetic field, leave a track in
the inner detector, indicated by full lines. Photons can convert into electron pairs
while crossing the inner detector therefore leaving only signs in some layers of
the ID. Electrons and photons are fully stopped in the electromagnetic calorimeter,
whereas hadrons, such as protons and neutrons, continue and deposit their energy
also in the hadronic calorimeter. Muons, being minimum ionizing particles (MIP),
leave a small amount of their energy in the detector, and make it through to the
muon spectrometer.In the volume of the muon spectrometer, they are curved by a
toroidal magnetic field and are measured before they escape the detector. Dashed
lines illustrate particles that do not interact with that part of the detector and are
effectively invisible. Some particles escape the detector leaving no trace behind; for
example neutrinos can only be inferred by conservation of energy and momentum
and show up as missing energy in some part of the detector.
2.4 The ATLAS detector: a general overview
2.4.4 Inner Detector
The Inner Detector (ID) [99, 100] is the ATLAS tracker which provides an effi-
cient detection of charged particles with high spatial and momentum resolutions
and is capable of identifying primary and secondary vertices; it is the innermost
detector of ATLAS and the closest one to the interaction point. It also provides
electron identification within  < 2.0 and over a wide range of energies (0.5 GeV -
150 GeV). The ID is contained within a cylindrical envelope of length 3512 mm
and of radius 1150 mm, and located at small radii from the beamline. Its high
granularity allows to perform the pattern recognition,vertex and momentum mea-
surements in the pseudo-rapidity range || < 2.5. These capabilities are achieved
with a combination of three different sub-detectors: the Silicon Pixel Detectors, the
SemiConductor Tracker (SCT) and the Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT) (as it
is shown in Fig. 2.12 and in Fig. 2.13). The main feature of the ID is its hardness
to the radiation, because it is subject to large doses of highly energetic particles.
Passive material in the ID must be minimized in order to avoid inducing particle
shower, causing the objects to loose energy before the calorimeter. The resolution
of the tracking parameter is given by:
= a b
(2.5)
where  indicates sum in quadrature. So one obtains:
 (pT )
= a  pT  b (2.6)
where the constant a is the intrinsic resolution of the detector, and b arises from
multiple scattering, dominating the resolution at low momentum.
When a particle interacts with one of sub-detector layers it deposits a part of
its energy to the sensor (e.g. pixel, straw tube, strips), and this energy is being
converted by the sensor readout electronics. If the signal is larger than a predefined
threshold a hit is recorded. One wants to have a large number of hits in order to
precisely measure the particles track. However, too much of detector material can
lead to multiple scattering and conversion of photons. The material budget of the
ID is shown in Fig. 2.11. All three sub-detectors provide a very good precision
measurement of momenta, such as:
 (pT )
= 0.005%  pT  1% (2.7)
The parameters of the ID are summarized in Table 2.2.
Silicon Pixel Detector
The Pixel detector is the component closest to the beam pipe and it therefore
has to cope with a higher particle flux than any other detector in ATLAS. This
requires a high granularity to disentangle tracks from individual charged particles
and to identify primary and secondary vertices. It is 1.4 m long and has a diameter

of 0.43 m. The active part of the pixel detector consists of a module composed of
silicon sensors, front-end electronics and flex-hybrids with control circuits. There
are 1744 modules resulting in a total active area of silicon of approximately 1.7 m2
and 80.4 million readout channels (this is about 50% of all the readout channels in
the entire detector). Each layer consists of several staves containing 13 modules
each.The area of each module is  2  6 cm2, the thickness is  250 m and they
contain thousands of pixels with a size of  50  400 m2 [101]. During the first
long shutdown of the LHC in 2013-2014, a new innermost pixel detector, the
Insertable B-layer (IBL) [102], was added between the first pixel layer and a new
smaller radius beam pipe at the radius of 33 mm, to help improve the vertex
resolution and efficiency of tagging hadrons composed by a b quark (b-tagging
efficiency), to compensate for inefficiencies in the pixel B-layer which can arise
over time due to irreversible radiation damage, as well as to meet the increasing
bandwidth requirements resulting from the expected Phase-I LHC peak luminosity.

The resolution of the Cartesian coordinates of reconstructed vertices is less than
0.35 mm for the z-direction and less than 0.16 mm in x and y directions [103]. With
increasing number of associated tracks, the resolution improves by up to about
one order of magnitude.

SemiConductor Tracker
After the Pixel Detector, the SCT completes the high precision tracking. It
is built around the pixel detector and it is designed to provide eight precision
measurements per track in the intermediate radial range, contributing to the
measurement of momentum, impact parameter and vertex position, as well as
providing good pattern recognition by the use of high granularity. The SCT tracker
includes four cylindrical layers of modules of silicon microstrips (each made up
by two sensor at a 40 mrad stereo angle, allowing to measure three-dimensional
space points) at average radii of about of 30.0, 37.3, 44.7 and 52.0 cm, and nine
disks on each end-cap regions to cover the full tracking pseudo-rapidity range
of || < 2.5. It has 4088 modules covering an area of approximately 63 m2. The
2112 barrel modules are two-sided and use microstrip sensors. Two sensors, each
containing 768 active strips, with a nominal thickness of 285 m and a strip pitch
of 80 m are mounted on both sides the modules. The end-cap disks use 1976
wedge-shaped modules of three different sizes. Including all active readout strips,
the SCT layers have more than 6.3 million readout channels in total. The spatial
resolution is about 16 m in the transverse plane and 580 m in the longitudinal z
direction. The system is operated at temperatures between 10 C and 5 C in
order to attenuate different types of electronic noise.
Transition Radiation Tracker
The TRT [104] is the outermost part of the ID and it consists of straw detectors
with diameter of 4 mm each and a 0.03 mm diameter gold-plated tungsten wire in
the centre of the tube. In the barrel part, these tubes are arranged parallel to the
beam axis placed at a radial region between 554 mm and 1082 mm with respect
to the beam axis. It contains 50000 straw tubes with a length of 144 cm, divided
into two parts with separate readout systems. The end-caps contain 250000 radial
straw tubes of 37 cm length with the readout system connected to the outer radius.
The tracking in the TRT is based on transition radiation, which is emitted by
charged particles traversing a boundary of two dielectric materials. The tubes are
2.4 The ATLAS detector: a general overview
filled with non-flammable xenon-based gas (70% Xe, 20% CO2 and 10% CF4). A
potential difference of 1.5 kV is applied to the central wire and the surface of the
tube, producing an electric current via gas ionization induced by the transition
radiation photons produced in polymer fibres (barrel) and foils (end-caps) sur-
rounding the tubes. This current is detectable as a count in the readout system.
Accordingly, this setup allows only to obtain an (R, ) information. The single
hit resolution is around 120 m in the barrel region and 130 m in the end-caps.
Compared to the other parts of the inner detector, this is rather low. However, for
each track, the TRT records around 30 hits, which significantly improves the spatial
resolution of the track reconstruction if the information of the TRT is combined
with the pixel detector and the SCT.
The TRT allows also particle identification by distinguishing between two different
types of transition radiation thresholds for the signal readout. A low-threshold,
optimized to detect direct ionization from particles penetrating the tube, whereas
a high-threshold is sensitive to transition radiation photons. Emission of transition
radiation is much more likely for electrons than for charged hadrons, meaning that
the high-threshold probability is different over a wide energy range. This allows a
discrimination of those particle types which is important, especially for an efficient
separation between  and e tracks. The total number of readout channels in the
TRT is approximately 351000. The barrel part covers pseudorapidities with || <
1.1. Including the end-caps, its total range is extended to || < 2.0.
2.4.5 Calorimeters
The ID is surrounded by the calorimeters [105, 106] which cover the range
|| < 4.9 and have a total diameter of 8.46 m and a length of 13.4 m. Their task is
to identify and measure the energy of particles (both charged and neutrals) and
jets. It also detects missing transverse energy (MET), produced by particles that
escape the detector undetected such as neutrinos) by summing all the measured
energy deposits: EmissT =
(ET cos)2 + (ET sin)2. To be more precise, EmissT
is defined as the momentum imbalance in the plane transverse to the beam axis:
the resultant of the negative vectorial sum of the momenta of all the particles,
based on the conservation of momentum in the plane transverse to the beam
axis z. This subsystem uses different techniques suited to the widely varying
requirements of the physics processes of interest. The fine granularity of the elec-
tromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) is ideally suited for precision measurements of
electrons and photons. The coarser granularity of the rest of the calorimeter, the
hadronic calorimeter (HCAL), is sufficient to satisfy the physics requirements
for jet reconstruction and MET measurements. Like many high energy experi-
ments, ATLAS has separate ECAL and HCAL up to || < 3.2. A special combined
electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter covers the range 3.1 < || < 4.9. The
calorimeters contain dense materials (absorbers), which cause an incoming particle
to initiate a shower. Particles created in this shower are detected in the active mate-
rial, which is interleaved with the absorbers. The total signal in the active material
is a measure of the energy of the incoming particle. ATLAS experiment uses two
types of active material: Liquid Argon (LAr) and scintillating plastic. Particles

that traverse the liquid-argon create charge by ionization, which is collected on
readout electrodes. The scintillating plastic is doped with fluorescent molecules,
which emit light when the atoms in the plastic are excited by a passing particle.
The light is detected and amplified by photomultiplier tubes. For the absorbers
several types of material are used: lead, steel, cooper and tungsten. The general
layout of the calorimeter is shown in Fig. 2.15.
Electromagnetic Calorimeter
The EM calorimeter is a sampling calorimeter made of LAr as scintillating
material and lead as absorbing material, providing complete  symmetry without
azimuthal cracks (more details can be found in [107]). As it is visible in Fig. 2.16,
the EM calorimeter has an accordion shape, which provides complete coverage
and symmetry in the azimuthal angle . The total depth of the EM calorimeter
exceeds 22 radiation lengths(X0) in the barrel region and 24 in the endcap. The
resolution provided by the EM calorimeter is:
 (E)
 0.3% (2.8)
where the first term is the sampling term and the second term is a constant term,
 () =
40 mrad
(2.9)
where E must be used in GeV. These are design values taken from Ref. [108].
In the region || < 2.5, the EM calorimeter is longitudinally segmented in three
layers:
2.4 The ATLAS detector: a general overview
Fig. 2.16: Read-out granularity and accordion shape of the barrel EM calorimeter.
1st Sampling (L1)
The very high segmentation in  of the first layer permits a precise measure-
ment of the shower position and a good rejection of fake photons from 0
decay, as well as is very useful to separate electrons from .
2nd Sampling (L2)
The second layer is the largest and allows to collect the larger fraction of the
energy of the incoming particles and provide the most precise measurement
in ; it is segmented in square towers (  = 0.025 0.025).
3rd Sampling (L3)
The last layer is dedicated to the measurement of the tails of the particle
showers.
An additional thin pre-sampler layer covering the || < 1.8 region where the
amount of material seen by an incident particle before the calorimeter front face
is > 2 radiation lengths (X0), is used to correct for fluctuations in energy losses of
particles before they reach the calorimeter. The total thickness of the EM calorime-
ter increases from 22 X0 to 30 X0 in region from  = 0 to  = 0.8 and 24X0 to 33 X0
in region from  = 0.8 to  = 1.3. The amount of material in terms of X0 is shown
in Fig. 2.17.
Hadronic Calorimeters
Surrounding the latter is the HCAL, which is divided in the Tile Calorimeter
(TileCal), the Hadronic End-cap Calorimeters (HEC) and the Forward Calorimeter
(FCal) with the inner radius of 2.28 m and the outer radius of 4.23 m. Similarly
to the EM calorimeter, the Tile calorimeter is longitudinally segmented into three
layers, which are needed for triggering and reconstruction of jets. The readout of
the tiles is performed by optical fibres. The tiles are grouped into readout cells,

which are designed to be projective with respect to the interaction point. The
TileCal covers the central region (|| < 1.7) and uses plastic scintillator plates
(called tiles) as active material and steel as absorber. The HEC extends up to || =
3.2 and relies on liquid-argon as active material and copper as absorber material.
In this region (|| < 3.2), the hadronic calorimeter can provide a resolution which
 (E)
 3% (2.10)
In the very forward region up to || = 4.9, the FCal is installed to improve the
measurement of the missing transverse energy. Again liquid-argon was chosen as
active material while the absorbing material is composed of copper and tungsten.
The ultimate energy resolution is expected to be:
 (E)
100%
 10% (2.11)
(in Eq. 2.10 and in Eq. 2.11 the energy must be considered in GeV). Design values
taken from Ref. [108].
The cumulative amount of material at the end of the active calorimetry region
varies between 10 and 18 nuclear interaction lengths.
2.4.6 Muon Spectrometer
The muon spectrometer (MS) surrounds the calorimeter and it consists of the
precision-tracking chambers to accurately and precisely measure the transverse
2.4 The ATLAS detector: a general overview

momentum of the muons and the trigger chambers with fast response to trigger
on the muons. The MS is immersed in a toroidal magnetic field of approximately
0.5 T and 1 T in the barrel and endcap regions, respectively. The MS is designed
to be capable of standalone measurements of the transverse momentum of the
muons in a wide range: down to about 3 GeV which is constrained by the muon
energy loss in the calorimeters, and up to about 3 TeV. For 1 TeV muon tracks,
the performance goal is to achieve approximately 10% stand-alone transverse
momentum resolution, which corresponds to a sagitta along the z-axis of about 500
m to be measured with a resolution of 50 m or less. Fig. 2.18 shows the layout of
the muon chambers in the x-y plane, Fig. 2.19 shows a cut view of one quadrant on
the MS. There are two different functions that muon chambers must accomplish:
triggering and high precision tracking. The trigger system covers the region up to
|| < 2.4 , and is composed by Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) in the barrel and
Thin Gap Chamber (TGC) in the end-caps. The triggering system provides bunch-
crossing identification (BCID), well-defined pT thresholds and a measurement
of the muon coordinate in the direction orthogonal to the chambers dedicated
2.4 The ATLAS detector: a general overview

to precision tracking. The tracking is performed by the Monitored Drift Tubes
(MDTs) and by Cathode Strip Chambers (CSCs) at large pseudorapidity. High
precision mechanical assembly techniques and optical alignment systems provide
the essential alignment of the chambers, while the magnetic field reconstruction
relies on Hall sensors distributed throughout the spectrometer volume.
Different magnetic fields permit to perform the measure of the momentum:
 In barrel region (|| < 1.4) the magnetic field is provided by the barrel toroid.
 For 1.4 < || < 1.6, by a combination of barrel toroid and end-cap toroid fields.
 For 1.6 < || < 2.4, by two end-cap toroids fields.
The overall momentum resolution provided by the muon system is:
 (pT )
= 3% at 50 GeV
 (pT )
= 10% at 1 TeV
These are design values and they are taken from Ref. [109]. The MDT and the
CSC provide a single hit resolution in the bending plane of about 80 m and 60
m, respectively. The muon track in the MS is reconstructed in two steps. In the
first step the muons are triggered in the RPC/TGC and local track segments are
defined in each layer of chambers. In the next step, the local track segments from
different layers are combined through a 2-fit forming a full MS track. To reduce
the probability of background tracks penetrating the calorimeter, the fitted tracks
of the muon candidates are required to point towards the interaction point.
Selected parameters characterize the performance of the muon sub-systems are
summarized in Table 2.3. The following sections will briefly describe the technol-
ogy and performances of the muon sub-systems.

2, 3) does not include chamber-alignment uncertainties. Column 4 shows the intrinsic
time resolution of each chamber type. Numbers in brackets refer to the complete detector
configuration as planned for 2009.
Monitored Drift-tube Chambers
The MDT chambers are made of drift tubes with a diameter of 30 mm. The
wall of the tube is made using aluminium and is 400 m in thickness. A
tungsten-rhenium wire of 50 m in diameter is located at the centre of the
tube. The tubes are operated with a non-flammable mixture of 93% Ar and
7% CO2 at an absolute pressure of 3 bar. A muon passing the tube is ionized
in the drift field. The electrons from the ionization drift towards the wire
with a maximum drift time of 700 ns when drifting from the wall to the
wire. The position of the muon thus can be determined through the tubes
non-linear space and time relation. The spatial resolution of a MDT tube is
about 80 m.
Cathode Strip Chambers
The CSCs are multi-wire proportional chambers with the wires oriented
in the radial direction. Both cathodes are segmented, one with the strips
perpendicular to the wires (providing the longitudinal coordinate) and the
other parallel to the wires providing the transverse coordinate. The position
of the track is obtained by interpolation between the charges induced on
neighbouring cathode strips while wire signals are not read out. The resolu-
tion of a CSC plane is about 60 m, while in the non-bending direction, the
cathode segmentation is coarser leading to a resolution of 5 mm.
Resistive Plate Chambers
In the barrel, RPCs are used to build trigger chambers because of good spa-
tial and time resolution, and adequate rate capability. The RPC is a gaseous
parallel electrode-plate detector, operated with a mixture of C2H2F4/Iso-
C4H10/SF6 (94.7/5/0.3), which combines the merits of relatively low operat-
ing voltage, non-flammability and low cost, while providing a comfortable
plateau for safe avalanche operation. It contains two resistive plates made of
phenolic-melaminic plastic laminate. They are kept parallel to each other at
a distance of 2 mm by insulating spacers, and the electric field between them
is about 4.9 kV/mm, allowing avalanches to form along the ionizing tracks
towards the anode. The signal is read out via capacitive coupling to metallic
strips, which are mounted on the outer faces of the resistive plates.
2.4 The ATLAS detector: a general overview
Thin Gap Chambers
In the endcap region, TGCs have been selected to build the trigger chambers
due to good time resolution and high rate capability. In addition to trigger
capability, TGCs provide a second azimuthal coordinate to complement the
measurement of the MDTs in the bending (radial) direction. TGCs are multi-
wire proportional chambers operated in a highly quenching gas mixture
of CO2 and n-C5H12 (n-pentane), with the characteristic that the wire-to-
cathode distance of 1.4 mm is smaller than the wire-to-wire distance of 1.8
mm. This cell geometry allows for operation in a quasi- saturated mode, i.e.
with a gas gain of 3  105.
2.4.7 Trigger System
The trigger system is an essential component of hadron collider experiments,
because the rate of events containing interesting physics phenomena is only a
small fraction of the total event rate. Due to the constraint from data storage
capacity and rates, it is impossible to store all the events produced in the collisions,
therefore, trigger system is employed to rapidly decide with high efficiency poten-
tial interesting events produced in a given bunch-crossing interaction to record for
later analysis. At the LHC design luminosity, the proton-proton collisions at the
LHC take place every 25 ns (40 MHz) with around 23 interactions per crossing.The
data-size of one recorded collision is in the order of 1 Mb. These regime can give
in total 40 Tb/s which is too high for the modern computer technology. The goal
of the ATLAS trigger system is to reduce the rate of candidate collisions from 40
MHz to 100 Hz without a loss of interesting physics events, in order to be handled
by the ATLAS computer system, which requires 100 Mb/s [110]. To reduce the
amount of data, the online event selection (called trigger system) has to decide
whether a collision looks interesting or not and for that employs several strategies.
The trigger system selects events by identifying signatures of muons, electrons,
photons, tau leptons, jets and B meson candidates, as well as using global event
signatures, such as MET. In Run 2, the trigger system consists of two levels of event
selections: a Level-1 trigger (L1) reducing event rate to 100 kHz and a high-level
trigger (HLT) [111] further reducing event rate to 1 kHz. In LHC Run 1, the HLT
includes two levels of event selections: Level-2 and Event Filter farms, which were
merged into a single homogeneous farm in Run 2 to improve resource sharing and
for simplification; the L1 trigger is implemented as hardware devices in the detec-
tor, while the HLT is almost software. With this configuration, the read-out system
(ROS) computers save network bandwidth and decrease the read-out request rate.
For Run 2, many multivariate analysis techniques have been developed and used
at the HLT stage, as for example, in electron and photon trigger systems [112]. The
ATLAS Trigger and Data Acquisition (TDAQ) system is illustrated in the block
diagram shown in Fig. 2.20 [113].
Level 1 Trigger
There are three L1 subsystems. One is the Level-1 calorimeter trigger (L1Calo),
which uses calorimeter information of reduced granularity to trigger electrons,
2.4 The ATLAS detector: a general overview

for triggering. L1Topo and Fast TracKer (FTK) were being commissioned during 2015.
photons, hadronic tau decays, jets and (missing) transverse energy. The other
system with a direct detector interface is the Level-1 muon trigger (L1Muon),
which primarily uses TGC and RPC information to make fast decisions on muon
trigger items. In the Central Trigger Processors [114], the information of L1Calo
and L1Muon is received and the final decision is made. For this it can also use the
recently added Level-1 topological trigger (L1Topo) [115] that combines informa-
tion from multiple L1Calo and L1Muon objects as well as their kinematics (e.g.
angular separation, invariant mass); then the CTP makes the final decision.
High Level Trigger
Events accepted by any L1 trigger, are further processed by the HLT, which
operates on the full event information (or in some cases on regions of interest
pre-selected by the Level 1 trigger). While the Level 1 trigger uses custom-made
electronics based on FPGAs, the HLT runs on a conventional computer cluster
and has about 0.2 s on average to decide. The target average HLT rate is 1 kHz,
a significant improvement compared to 0.6 kHz in LHC Run 1. The set of active
triggers usually changes during the data taking, as the intensity of the beam
changes. Trigger items may be prescaled, e.g. a specified fraction of positive
trigger decisions is randomly ignored, which makes it possible to use triggers
which unprescaled rates are too high to record their events. A fast tracker trigger
system (FTK) [116] which provides tracking information to the HLT is being
prepared for operation later in Run 2. Among others, this will benefit tau and
b-jet triggers. Another important pending upgrade will improve the granularity
of calorimeter information available to L1Calo [117] and therefore also benefit tau

triggers. It will be installed during Long Shut-down 2 (from December 2018 until
February 2021).
2.4.8 Computing Models: the GRID
ATLAS works with large amount of data and need sufficient computer facilities
to process this data. For the LHC, storage and processing requirements exceed by
far the capacities available at a single site and hence a new approach was chosen,
which is commonly known under the LHC Computing Grid (LCG) [118,119]. This
computing grid provides an infrastructure for the storage of data and the necessary
computing power for the physics analyses and simulations. The data distribution
follows a so-called tier-structure (see Fig. 2.21). The LHC data is recorded in a
first step on tape at Tier-0 centre at CERN; from there, it is further distributed to
worldwide Tier-1 centres, which also stores a large part of data and provides a 24-
hours support. On the other hand, the tier-2 centres store only a small part of data
since they are designated for user specific physics analysis and simulation. The
main advantage of this tier structure is that several copies of data exist. This fact
means that a single tier centre is independent from the others and that minimizes
the critical points in the infrastructure.
2.4.9 ATLAS Software
The main goal of the ATLAS offline software is to process all data coming from
the trigger and DAQ system and to allow users to analyze them with specific
tools. In case of the ATLAS experiment, there is an offline software framework
called Athena [120], with the underlying architecture starting from the GAUDI one
originally developed by the LHCb collaboration. It is written mainly in C++ and
2.4 The ATLAS detector: a general overview

therefore object oriented, with the configuration files written in Python. This frame-
work encompasses not only the reconstruction and analysis algorithms needed for
the ATLAS data, but also all the other software needed for the HEP computing;
in addition, the Athena framework is used also for generating all Monte Carlo
(MC) samples needed by the analysers (the major components of its framework
are shown in Fig. 2.22).
Athena provides an integrated communication between various software appli-
cations, called algorithms, within the framework. The principle functionality of
an algorithm is to take input data, manipulate it and produce new output data.
Therefore, Athena processes data event by event. All algorithms cam make their
data accessible to access via other algorithms (for example the event information
part way-through the reconstruction). Moreover, Athena framework also contains
services which are sizeable components that are setup and initialized once at the
beginning of the job by the framework and used by many algorithms as often as
they are needed, for example the detector description. Additionally, the Athena
framework allows dynamic loading of libraries and is organized in form of plug-in
modules and allows a flexible configuration of various algorithms to be executed.
For data storage, plotting and processing histograms, Athena uses the ROOT
framework [121]; all ATLAS data are stored in one of the ROOT formats, which
provide a size compressing and fast access of the data.
Chapter3
Object reconstruction in ATLAS
The unprocessed output of the ATLAS detector or its simulation is not suitable
for most physics analyses; indeed, the raw data from the ATLAS detector is a series
of readout signals. The task of the offline reconstruction software is to translate
this stream of readout signals into the information necessary to perform physics
analysis. Reconstruction of physics objects such as electrons, muons, taus and jets
begin with reconstruction of basic objects such as tracks (in the ID) and calorimeter
clusters. This chapter describes the reconstruction and identification algorithms
for the physics objects relevant for the analyses presented in this thesis.
3.1 Low-level objects
To reconstruct the trajectories of charged particles, the Inner Detector (ID) hits
are associated to form tracks. In ATLAS, the tracks of primary charged particles
are built using inside-out track finding [122, 123]. This algorithm is seeded using
information of the innermost layers of the pixel detector and then follows the
general direction to the outer layers of the Inner Detector to build track candidates.
Afterwards, a Kalman filter [124] is applied iteratively to all hits associated to
the track candidate and outlier hits are rejected. The numbers of misidentified
trajectories and tracks with shared hits is reduced using dedicated ambiguity
solving algorithms. In a last step the track is extended to the TRT and its hits here
are fitted together with the track from the silicon detectors. The resulting track
has five parameters (as already specified in Sec. 2.8), which consist of the location
on a plane, as well as two angles and the curvature of the trajectory. Additionally,
outside-in track finding is performed, which is seeded in the TRT and directed
towards the silicon detectors. In particular, this recovers tracks from decays of
long-lived particles that decay beyond the silicon detectors. Based on track quality
criteria like the number of silicon hits, tracks are usually filtered further for the
reconstruction of higher level physics objects. The commonly used "loose" track
quality selection results in reconstruction efficiencies over 90%, where the exact
value depends on the pseudorapidity and track transverse momentum, pT [125].
Important track properties are the transverse and longitudinal impact parame-
ters d0 and z0, the projections of the distance between the track and a reference
3.1 Low-level objects
point at the closest point of approach. Their resolution is typically well below
0.01 mm. Tracks passing certain quality criteria are considered for the reconstruc-
tion of vertices, which are points of particle interaction. In an iterative process,
tracks are associated to vertex candidates and fits are performed to determine
the vertex position [126] (further details will follow in Section 3.2). The positions
of the proton-proton interactions are called primary vertices. The reconstruction
efficiency rises from 83% for vertices with two tracks to almost 100% for vertices
with at least five tracks. The hard scattering vertex is chosen as the primary vertex
with the highest
p2T .
To reduce the impact of electric noise and pile-up, and to facilitate further calorimeter-
based object reconstructions, the signals of adjacent calorimeter cells are condensed
to form topological clusters [127]. Starting from a cell with an energy deposition at
least four times higher than its expected noise level, topologically connected cells
are added to the cluster using a growing-volume algorithm [127]. The cluster energy
is calibrated to compensate for inactive detector material and non-compensating
calorimeter response. Clusters can be calibrated at the electromagnetic scale, which
is tuned to clusters in showers created by electrons (EM topo-clusters). Another
common approach, the local hadronic cell weighting, corrects for differences between
pion and electron showers by estimating the likelihood that a cluster is in an
electromagnetic or hadronic shower and weighting the contributions accordingly
(LCW topo-clusters).
As regards the tracking in the Muon Spectrometer (MS), the tracks start from
segments reconstructed within each muon chamber. In each MDT chamber and
nearby trigger chamber, a Hough transform is used to search for hits. Segments are
reconstructed by performing a straight-line fit to the hits found in each MDT layer.
The RPC or TGC hits measure the coordinate orthogonal to the bending plane.
Segments in the CSC detectors are reconstructed by a combinatorial search for
hits in the  and  CSC planes, including a loose requirement on the compatibility
of the segment with the luminous region. Muon track candidates are then built
by fitting together hits from segments in different layers. The algorithm used for
this task performs a segment-seeded combinatorial search that starts by using as
seeds the segments generated in the middle layers of the detector where more
trigger hits are available. The search is then extended to use the segments from the
outer and inner layers as seeds. The segments are selected using criteria based on
hit multiplicity and fit quality and are matched using their relative positions and
angles. At least two matching segments are required to build a track, except in the
barrel endcap transition region where a single high-quality segment with  and 
information can be used to build a track. The same segment can initially be used
to build several track candidates. Later, an overlap removal algorithm selects the
best assignment to a single track, or allows for the segment to be shared between
two tracks. To ensure high efficiency for close-by muons, all tracks with segments
in three different layers of the spectrometer are kept when they are identical in
two out of three layers but share no hits in the outermost layer. The hits associated
with each track candidate are fitted using a 2 fit. A track candidate is accepted
if the 2 of the fit satisfies criteria on e.g. hits position, energy deposit along the
tracks etc. The track candidate will be re-fitted in cases where hits making large
3.2 Primary Vertex
contributions to the 2 are removed or additional hits consistent with the track
candidate are recovered.
3.2 Primary Vertex
The input to the vertex reconstruction is a collection of reconstructed tracks.
The procedure of primary vertex reconstruction is divided into two stages: vertex
finding and vertex fitting [126]. The former stage generally denotes the pattern
recognition process: the association of reconstructed tracks to vertex candidates.
The vertex fitting stage calculates the best-fit vertex position and its covariance
matrix. The strategy can be briefly outlined in these steps:
 A set of tracks satisfying the track selection criteria is defined.
 A seed position for the first vertex is selected, using a sliding window of 0.7
cm that is moved along the whole interaction region.
 The tracks and the seed are used to estimate the best vertex position with a
fit following an iterative procedure. In each iteration, less compatible tracks
are down-weighted and the vertex position is recomputed.
 Tracks incompatible with the vertex determined in the previous step are
removed and allowed to be used in the determination of another vertex.
 The whole procedure is repeated with the remaining tracks in the event to fit
another vertex.
All vertices with at least two associated tracks are retained as valid primary vertex
candidates. The output of the vertex reconstruction algorithm is a set of three
dimensional vertex positions and their covariance matrices.
3.3 Leptons
In this section the methods used for reconstructing leptons are presented. The
attention is focused on electrons and muons because these object characterise the
final states of the analyses presented in this thesis.
3.3.1 Muons
Muon Reconstruction
Muons are minimum ionizing particles and they deposit minimum amount
of energies when travelling across the calorimeters. The detector components
involved in muon reconstruction are the muon spectrometer and the inner detector.
However, muons also deposit some energy in the ECAL. The muon system allows
the identification of muons with a pT above 3 GeV. Muons with momenta lower
than that are difficult to reconstruct since they do not reach the spectrometer, loose
3.3 Leptons
too much energy in the calorimeter and/or do not leave a significant signal over
the noise in the muon spectrometer.
Muon reconstruction is performed based on information from the ID, MS and
calorimeters. There are four different types, depending on different reconstruction
methods and subdetectors used [128]:
 Combined muons (CB): The combined muon reconstruction algorithm takes
the SA muons and matches them to inner detector tracks which satisfy a 2
quality test; the muons momentum is computed as a weighted combination
of the momentum measurements in the ID an in the MS. Muons within
||< 2.5 can be reconstructed in this way.
 Segmented-tagged muons (ST): This algorithm has been designed to im-
prove the reconstruction of low pT muons, which do not reach the outer
muon station. ST muons are reconstructed by extrapolating a track in the
ID to the first station of the MS: the quality of this matching procedure is
evaluated using a 2 test defined by the difference the MS track and the
prediction from the extrapolated ID track (as for CB muons), the || coverage
is ||< 2.5.
 Calorimeter-tagged muons: In the region of || < 0.1, ID tracks with 15 GeV <
pT < 100 GeV are identified as muons if their energy deposits in the calorime-
ter are consistent with minimum ionizing particles. CT muons recover muon
acceptance in the region where the MS is only partially instrumented to
allow for cabling and services to the calorimeters and the ID.
 Extrapolated (ME) muons: The muon trajectory is reconstructed based only
on the MS track and a loose requirement on compatibility with originating
from the IP. The parameters of the muon track are defined at the interaction
point, taking into account the estimated energy loss of the muon in the
calorimeters. In general, the muon is required to traverse at least two layers
of MS chambers to provide a track measurement, but three layers are required
in the forward region. ME muons are mainly used to extend the acceptance
for muon reconstruction into the region 2.5 < || < 2.7, which is not covered
by the ID.
Muon Identification
To distinguish prompt muons from background like light meson decays, a
muon identification is performed. For this, several quality requirements are ap-
plied, related to the compatibility of the measurement in the Inner Detector and
muon spectrometer, the goodness of the combined track fit and the quality of the
individual tracks. There are four kinds of muon identification criteria designed to
address the specific needs of physics analyses:
 Loose muons, are designed to maximize the reconstruction efficiency while
provide good-quality muon tracks.
3.3 Leptons
 Medium muons, are designed to minimize the systematic uncertainties asso-
ciated with muon reconstruction and calibration. Only CB and MS muons are
considered, with addition requirement on the number of hits in muon cham-
bers and a loose requirement on the compatibility between pT measurements
in the ID and MS.
 Tight muons, are selected to maximize the purity of muons at the cost of
some efficiency. Only CB muons with at least two hits in MS and satis-
fying the medium criteria are considered. Additionally, requirements on
normalized 2 of the track fit and the compatibility between ID and MS pT
measurements is employed to further reject background.
 High-pT muons, are optimized for searches for high-mass Z  and W  res-
onances. To maximize the momentum resolution for muons with pT > 100
GeV, CB muons satisfying medium requirements and having at least three
hits in three MS stations are included. Regions of the MS are vetoed, where
the alignment is suboptimal.
The Medium identification criteria is used as default selection for muons in
ATLAS and it minimises the reconstruction and calibration uncertainties. Some
corrections are applied to MC simulations in form of efficiency scale factors (SF),
in order to match isolation and trigger efficiency in data. These corrections are
obtained by comparing MC predictions to large samples of J/  + and
Z  + data events using the tag-and-probe method. In Fig. 3.1 the efficiency of
the reconstruction for Medium muons as a function of their pT is shown. As can
be seen, it is very close to 99%.
Muon momentum scale and resolution
The muon momentum scale and resolution are studied using J  +
and Z  + decays. Although the simulation contains an accurate description
of the ATLAS detector, the level of detail is not enough to describe the muon
momentum scale to the per mille level and the muon momentum resolution to
the percent level. To obtain such of agreement between data and simulation, a
set of corrections is applied to the simulated muon momentum. To improve the
precision of the procedure, the pT and  distributions of the Z and J/ resonances
in simulation are reweighted to the distributions observed in data. The invariant
mass distribution for the Z  + candidate is shown in Fig. 3.2. After correction,
the line-shape of the Z resonance in simulation (red solid line) agrees with the
data within the systematic uncertainties, demonstrating the overall effectiveness
of the pT calibration. A better demonstration of the effectiveness of the momentum
calibration is obtained by comparing, in data and simulation, the measurement of
the positionm and resolution  of the di-muon mass peaks, extracted in bins of
 and pT from fits to the J  + and Z  + invariant mass distributions.

Muon Isolation
Several isolation selection criteria (isolation working points) are defined, each
optimised for different physics analyses. Table 3.1 lists the most relevant isolation
working points for the analysis presented here, specifying the discriminating vari-
ables and the criteria used in their definition. The track-based isolation variable,

with pT > 1 GeV in a cone of size R = min(10 GeV/p
T, 0.3) around the muon of
transverse momentum pT, excluding the muon track itself. The cone size is chosen
to be pT-dependent to improve the performance for muons produced in the decay
of particles with a large transverse momentum. The calorimeter-based isolation
3.3 Leptons
variable, Etopocone20T , is defined as the sum of the transverse energy of topological
clusters [129] in a cone of size R = 0.2 around the muon, after subtracting the
contribution from the energy deposit of the muon itself and correcting for pile-up
effects.
The efficiencies for the isolation working points are measured in data and simula-
tion in Z  + decays using the tag-and-probe method. To avoid probe muons
in the vicinity of a jet, the angular separation R between the probe muon and
the closest jet, reconstructed using an anti-kt algorithm [130] with radius param-
eter 0.4 and with a transverse momentum greater than 20 GeV is required to be
greater than 0.4. In addition, the two muons originating from the Z boson decay
are required to be separated by R > 0.3. Fig. 3.4 shows the isolation efficiency
measured for Medium muons in data and simulation as a function of the muon pT
for the FixedCutLoose working points, with the respective data/MC ratios included
in the bottom panel. The agreement between data and MC is at few percent level,
less than 2%.

3.3.2 Electrons
Electron reconstruction method makes use of a combination of the information
coming from the ECAL [131] and the ID tracking system. An excellent electron
identification is crucial to reject the large backgrounds typically originating from
jets leading to fake electrons. The first step, referred to as cluster reconstruction, is
the identification of energy clusters deposited in the EM calorimeter; these clusters
3.3 Leptons
are reconstructed using a dedicated sliding-window algorithm [132]: this algorithm
looks at calorimeter cells within a rectangular window of 3  5 in units of 0.025 
0.025 in the    space. This size is fixed and it is usually referred to as "a tower".
The energy of each tower is obtained by summing the energy deposit found in
all the longitudinal layers of region in the    space. After the selection of a
local maximum in the transverse energy (ET > 2.5 GeV), this energy deposit in
treated as a seed cluster, which has to match with one or more tracks coming from
the reconstruction in the ID; this procedure of track matching takes account of
radiative energy losses of high-energy electrons, which can change the path of an
electron and, consequently, modify the track.
The track fitting and extrapolation is done with the so-called Gaussian Sum Filter
(GSF) algorithm, which takes care of bremsstrahlung energy losses and experi-
mental noise [133]. This algorithm is based on the following idea: the trajectory of
an electron can be approximated as a weighted sum of Gaussian functions; this
means that the GSF divides the experimental noise and bremsstrahlung energy
losses into individual Gaussian components and processes each one of them using
a Kalman Filter algorithm [134]. The GSF algorithm finds all the electron candi-
date tracks (with pT > 400 MeV and ||< 2.5), which are fitted again: the tracks
obtained by this fit procedure are used to compute electron 4-momentum and
match the clusters found in the EM calorimeter (if a energy cluster is matched to a
reconstructed track having transverse momentum greater than 0.5 GeV, then an
electron candidate is formed).
For Run-2 analyses, the electron measurements are performed by requiring the
track associated with the electron to be compatible with the primary interaction
vertex of the hard collision, in order to reduce the background from conversions
and secondary particles. The track parameters are calculated in a reference frame
where the z-axis is taken along the measured beam-line position. The following
conditions are also applied: d0/d0 < 5 and |z0 sin  < 0.5 mm, where the impact
parameter d0 is the distance of closest approach of the track to the measured beam-
line, z0 is the distance along the beam-line between the point where d0 is measured
and the beam-spot position,  is the polar angle of the track and d0 represents the
estimated uncertainty of the d0 parameter. To assess the compatibility with the
primary vertex of the hard collision the z0 between the track and the primary
vertex is employed. This vertex is selected from the reconstructed primary vertices
(compatible with the beam-line) as the one with the highest sum of transverse
momenta of the associated tracks. The efficiency of these requirements in data and
MC is estimated together with the efficiency of the various identification operating
points.
Electron reconstruction efficiency
The electron reconstruction and trigger efficiencies are measured with the
so called tag-and-probe method [135] based on Z  e+e, W  e and J/ 
e+e data and simulated samples: one lepton is selected using the standard cuts
(tag), while for the second candidate (probe) a looser set of cuts is applied. The
electron identification efficiencies [136] are derived from combined measurements
using Z  ee and W  e events. Additionally, the energy is corrected for
3.3 Leptons
non-uniformity of the detector response and by using a multivariate regression
algorithm trained on MC simulation to correct for loss of energy outside the
calorimeter or the clusters. To account for small differences of the calibration
between simulation and data, both the energy scale (in data) and resolution (in
Monte Carlo simulation) are adjusted based on corrections measured in Z  e+e
events. The resolution is depending on the pseudorapidity and energy of the
electron. In the central  < 0.5 region it ranges from 2.5% for 25 GeV to 0.5%
for 1 TeV, for larger  it rises up to 10% for low energy electrons [137]. These
values have been determined for Run 1 data, but are still approximately valid, as
discussed in Ref. [136]. Only small modifications have been made to correct for
changes in conditions between Run 1 and Run 2. For most of the pseudorapidity
range the reconstruction efficiency is above 97% and increases with the energy
of the reconstructed electron. The electron reconstruction efficiency measured in
Z  e+e events of 2015 data, as a function of the transverse energy of the electron
cluster (ET ) and the corresponding pseudorapidity  is shown in Fig. 3.5. It is

visible that the reconstruction efficiency drops in the so-called crack region (1.37 <
|| < 1.52), where the barrel and end-cap calorimeters meet.
Electron Identification
After the electron reconstruction, using EM calorimeter and tracking system
information, a cut-based approach is used to identify the electrons in the ||< 2.47
region (the transition region between the barrel and endcap calorimeters, i.e
1.37 < ||< 1.52, is excluded). This step is called electron identification.
Three different selections, optimized in bins of  and ET , are defined, according to
3.3 Leptons
the quality of the reconstruction, providing different electron efficiency versus jet
rejection working points: loose, medium and tight.
 Loose: The loose identification criteria uses only information from the calorime-
ters. Cuts are applied on the hadronic leakage (the ratio of the ET in the first
compartment of the HCAL and in the whole ECAL) and on shower shape
variables (lateral shower shape and width) based on the second layer of the
ECAL. This set of cuts provides excellent identification efficiency but low
background rejection.
 Medium: This selection improves the quality by adding cuts on both the
ECAL and the tracking variables. The fine longitudinal segmentation of
the first layer of the ECAL is exploited, in particular to reject photons from
neutral pion decays, which result into very close deposits of energy; this
selection increases the jet rejection by a factor 3-4 with respect to the loose
identification and reduces the selection efficiency by  10%.
 Tight: This set of cuts makes use of all the particle identification tools; further
cuts are applied on the tracking variables and an additional energy (and
momentum) isolation cut is applied to the cluster using all cell energies
within a cone of R < 0.2 (and 0.3) around the electron candidate. This
selection provides the highest isolated electron identification and rejection
against jets.
As for the muons, some corrections are applied to MC simulation in form of
efficiency scale factors, in order to match isolation and trigger efficiency in data.
These corrections are obtained by comparing MC predictions to J/  e+e and
Z  e+e data samples using the tag-and-probe method. In Fig. 3.6 the combined
electron reconstruction and identification efficiencies in Z  e+e events as a
function of the transverse energy ET , and as a function of pseudorapidity  are
shown.
Energy scale and resolution
The electron energy scale and the inter-calibration of the different parts of the
EM calorimeter are obtained from Z  e+e, J/  e+e and W  e (as
shown in Fig. 3.7 for Z  e+e events). The relative alignment of the calorimeter
components with respect to the inner detector has been measured using electron
candidates, compatible with the ones coming from W and Z decays. Fig. 3.7 shows
the comparison of the invariant mass distribution for Z  ee candidates between
data and simulation after the energy resolution correction has been applied to the
data. Within the uncertainties in the calibration and resolution correction factors,
the data and simulation are in fair agreement.

Photon PDF determination
This study has been produced in collaboration between myself and some
members of the xFitter Collaboration [139]. In this analysis, I was the main
analyser and participated in the weekly/bi-weekly xFitterDevelopers meetings,
where I gave regular updates between the beginning of September 2016 and the
end of January 2017. This work resulted in the following publication: "The photon
PDF from high-mass Drell-Yan data at the LHC" [140]. During the course of
my PhD, I had impact in other publications within this collaboration, namely:
"Impact of the heavy quark matching scales in PDF fits" [141] and "Impact of low-x
resummation on QCD analysis of HERA data" [142], both published on EPJC.
4.1 Preface
Achieving the highest precision for theoretical predictions at the LHC requires
the calculation of hard-scattering cross-sections that include perturbative QCD
corrections up to (N)NNLO and electroweak (EW) corrections up to NLO. Parton
distribution functions (PDFs) need to be provided with matching accuracy, which
in the case of QED effects involves introducing the photon parton distribution
function of the proton, x(x,Q2). In this chapter, a determination of the photon
PDF from fits to recent ATLAS measurements of high-mass Drell-Yan (DY) di-
lepton production at
s = 8 TeV is presented [143]. The analysis reported in the
following chapter of my thesis is based on the xFitter framework [139] and has
required improvements both in the APFEL [144] program, to account for NLO
QED effects, and in the aMCfast [145] interface to account for the photon-initiated
(PI) contributions in the EW calculations within MadGraph5_aMC@NLO [146].
4.2 Introduction
Precision phenomenology at the LHC requires theoretical calculations which
include not only QCD corrections, where NNLO is rapidly becoming the standard,
but also EW corrections, which are particularly significant for observables directly
sensitive to the TeV region, where EW Sudakov logarithms are enhanced. An
4.3 Data and theory
important ingredient of these electroweak corrections is the photon PDF of the
proton, x(x,Q2), which must be introduced to absorb the collinear divergences
arising in initial-state QED emissions.
The first PDF fit to include both QED corrections and a photon PDF was MRST2004
QED [48], where the photon PDF was taken from a model and tested on HERA
data for direct photon production [147]. Almost 10 years later, the NNPDF2.3
QED analysis [148, 149], provided a first model-independent determination of
the photon PDF based on DY data from the LHC. The resulting photon PDF was
however affected by large uncertainties due to the limited sensitivity of the data
used as input to that fit. The determination of x(x,Q2) from NNPDF23 QED was
later combined with the state-of-the-art quark and gluon PDFs from NNPDF3.0,
together with an improved QED evolution, to construct the NNPDF3.0 QED
set [49, 50]. The CT group has also released a QED fit using a similar strategy as
the MRST2004 QED, named the CT14 QED set [51].
A recent breakthrough concerning the determination of the photon content of
the proton has been the realization that x(x,Q2) can be calculated in terms of
inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) structure functions. The photon PDF from
this strategy is called LUXqed [52, 53] and its residual uncertainties are now at the
few percent level, not too different from those of the quark and gluon PDFs. A
related approach by HKR [54], denoted by HKR16 in the following, also leads to a
similar photon PDF as compared to the LUXqed calculation, although no estimate
for the associated uncertainties is provided in this case.
In this chapter, I present a direct determination of the photon PDF from recent high-
mass DY data collected at the LHC with the ATLAS detector at
s = 8 TeV and I
show comparison between this prediction and some existing determinations of the
above-described x(x,Q2). In the ATLAS publication on Drell-Yan data [143] the
Bayesian reweighting method [150, 151] was applied to NNPDF2.3QED, showing
that these data can provide significant information on x(x,Q2). The goal of
this study is therefore to investigate further these constraints from the ATLAS
high-mass DY measurements on the photon PDF, this time by means of a direct
PDF fit performed within the open-source xFitter framework. State-of-the-art
theoretical calculations are employed, in particular the inclusion of NNLO QCD
and NLO QED corrections to the PDF evolution and the computation of the DIS
structure functions as implemented in the APFEL program. The implementation
of NLO QED effects in APFEL is presented here for the first time. The inclusion of
NLO QED evolution effects is cross checked using the independent QEDEVOL code
[152] based on the QCDNUM evolution program [153]. The resulting determination
of x(x,Q2) represents an important validation test of recent developments in
theory and data concerning our understanding of the nature and implications of
the photon PDF.
4.3 Data and theory
The DY process of lepton pair production in hadronic interactions, Z/ 
`+`, is a powerful tool in understanding the nature of partonic interactions and
of hadronic structure in detail.
4.3 Data and theory
Fig. 4.1: Diagrams that contribute to lepton-pair production at hadron colliders at the Born
level.
Here, the photon content of the proton x(x,Q2) is extracted from a PDF analysis
based on the combined inclusive DIS cross-section data from HERA [34] supple-
mented by the ATLAS measurements of high-mass DY differential cross sections
s = 8 TeV. The HERA inclusive data are the backbone of modern PDF fits,
providing information on the quark and gluon content of the proton, while the
high-mass DY data provide a direct sensitivity to the photon PDF.
Two processes contribute to opposite sign, same family, di-lepton production at
the LHC: the quark-antiquark s-channel scattering, and from photon-photon t-
and u-channel scattering mediated by a lepton. The Feynman diagrams of the
above-described processes are illustrated in Fig. 4.1. The ATLAS high-mass Drell-
Yan 8 TeV measurements are presented in terms of both the single-differential (1D)
invariant-mass distribution, d/dm``, as well as double-differential (2D) distri-
butions in m`` and y``, namely d2/dm``d|y``|, and in m`` and ``, d2/dm````,
where m`` and y`` represent the invariant mass and the rapidity of the di-lepton fi-
nal state respectively and `` is the difference in pseudorapidity between leading
and sub-leading muon. For the invariant-mass 1D distribution, there are 12 bins
between m`` = 116 GeV and 1.5 TeV; and for both double-differential distributions,
there are five different bins in invariant mass, from the lowest bin with 116 GeV <
m`` < 150 GeV to the highest bin with 500 GeV < m`` < 1500 GeV. The first three
(last two) m`` bins of the 2D distributions are divided into 12 (6) bins with fixed
width, extending up to 2.4 and 3.0 for the |y``| and |``| distributions, respectively.
The photons which undergo hard scattering in the   `` process from Fig. 4.1
can be produced by either emission from the proton as a whole (the elastic com-
ponent) or radiated by the constituent quarks (the inelastic component). From
the theory point of view, the photon PDF extracted from the fit is by construction
the sum of the elastic and inelastic contributions, though this analysis is mostly
sensitive to the latter. The NLO high-mass DY cross sections have been simulated
with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO (version 2.4.3), which includes the contribution from
photon-initiated diagrams, interfaced to APPLgrid (version 01-04-70) through
aMCfast (version 01-03-00). A tailored release of APPLgrid has been used, to
account for the contribution of the photon-initiated processes 1. Both the contribu-
tions are generated in the 5-flavours number scheme (nf = 5), where all the quarks,
except for the top quark, are treated as massless quarks; all the calculations are
performed at parton-level fixed-order (FO) without parton shower. Furthermore,
mass effects of charm and bottom quarks in the matrix elements, as appropriate
1Modified version of APPLgrid available at: https://github.com/scarrazza/APPLgridphoton
4.3 Data and theory
for a high-scale process, have been neglected.
These NLO theoretical predictions are generated using the same selections as in
reference [143], namely:
 the invariant mass of the lepton pair is required to be greater than 116 GeV;
 the absolute value of the pseudorapidity of each lepton is required to be less
than 2.5;
 the transverse momentum (pT ) of the leading lepton has to be greater than
40 GeV;
 the pT of the sub-leading lepton has to be greater than 30 GeV.
In modern PDF fitting, many cross-sections which are used cannot be computed
analytically in a sufficient short time for input to an iterative PDF fit thus inter-
polation grid techniques are used. Running MadGraph5_aMC@NLO to produce
interpolation grids in the APPLgrid format using the aMCfast interface requires
two main steps. The first step consists of setting up and optimizing the interpo-
lation grids that will be subsequently filled up in the second step. As already
mentioned above, the production of grids is directly connected to a fixed-order
analysis in the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO framework. Practically, this is done by
doing a preliminary "low statistics" run that allows the code to optimize the in-
terpolation grids based on the particular observables defined in the analysis file.
Then, after that this optimisation at low accuracy has been performed, it is possible
to proceed to a higher accuracy determination The specific parameters used in
the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO run card for generating the APPLgrid predictions are
listed below:
 True = reweight_scale (in order to get scale dependence - scaled varied up
and down by a factor of 2);
 True = reweight_PDF (in order to get PDF uncertainty) - reweighting per-
formed using LHAPDF (version 6.1.6);
 29.0 = ptl (minimum lepton transverse momentum pT );
 2.6 = etal (maximum lepton |pseudorapidity| ||);
 111.0 = mll (minimum invariant mass of all opposite sign lepton pairs);
 30.0 = mll_sf (minimum invariant mass of all opposite sign same-flavour
lepton pairs);
 5 = maxjetflavor (5-flavours number scheme).
As discussed below, the NLO calculations are then supplemented by K-factors
obtained from FEWZ [154] to match higher order (NNLO) calculations. The NLO
EW corrections to the DY processes are also estimated using FEWZ. The photon-
initiated process is taken at LO since this corresponds to the APPLgrid implemen-
tation and the NLO corrections are very small compared to the data accuracy. The
parameters of the input grids are set as follows:

APPLgrid: PI_apfel_for_lhaGridQED). The difference between the two predic-
tions is at most 1%, for both the 1-dimensional and the 2-dimensional distributions,
as shown in Fig. 4.2 (for the d/dm`` distribution) and in Fig. 4.3 (for the double
differential cross sections - for these only rapidity distributions are shown, since
they are the most sensitive one to the photon contribution). The same comparison
has been made for the LO PI predictions shown in Fig. 4.4 and Fig. 4.5.
The DIS structure functions and PDF evolution are computed with the APFEL
program [144], which is currently accurate up to NNLO in QCD and NLO in
QED, including the relevant mixed QCD+QED corrections. This means that, on
top of the pure QCD contributions, the DGLAP evolution equations [32, 33, 155]
are solved including the O(s) and O(2) corrections to the splitting functions.
Corrections of O() are also included leading to a (weak) explicit dependence
of the predictions on the photon PDF. Heavy-quark (charm and bottom) mass
effects to DIS structure functions are taken into account using the FONLL-B (C)
general-mass scheme [156] for the NLO (NNLO) fits. The numerical values of the
heavy-quark masses in the mass parameter scheme are taken to be mc = 1.47 GeV
and mb = 4.5 GeV as determined in [34], consistent with the latest PDG aver-
ages [157]. The reference values of the QCD and QED coupling constants are
chosen to be s(mZ) = 0.118 and (m = 1.777 GeV) = 1/133.4, again consistent
with the PDG recommended values. In the calculation of the Drell-Yan cross sec-
tion, dynamical renormalisation R and factorisation F scales are used, which are
set equal to the scale of invariant mass m``, both for the quark- and gluon-induced
and for the photon-induced contributions.
The choice of other values for these scales in the QED diagrams, such as a fixed
scale R = F = MZ , leads to variations of the photon-initiated cross-sections
of a few percent at most. The choice of the scale for the photon PDF is further
discussed in [158, 159].
For the kinematics of the ATLAS DY data, the ratio between the photon-initiated
contributions and quark- and gluon-induced di-lepton production is largest for

central rapidities and large invariant masses. For the most central (forward) ra-
pidity bin, 0 < |y``|< 0.2 (2.0 < |y``|< 2.4), the ratio between the QED and QCD
contributions varies between 2.5% (2%) at low invariant masses and 12% (2.5%)
for the highest m`` bin. Therefore, data from the central region will exhibit the
highest sensitivity to x(x,Q2).
The MadGraph5_aMC@NLONLO QCD and LO QED calculations used in this work
have been benchmarked against the corresponding predictions obtained with the
FEWZ code, finding agreement within statistical uncertainties of the predictions
for both the 1D and the 2D distributions. In order to achieve NNLO QCD and
NLO EW accuracy in our theoretical calculations, the NLO QCD and LO QED
cross-sections computed with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO have been supplemented
by bin-by-bin K-factors defined as:
K(m``, |y``|) 
NNLO QCD + NLO EW
NLO QCD + LO EW
, (4.1)
using the MMHT2014 NNLO [160] PDF set both in the numerator and in the de-
nominator. The K-factors have been computed using FEWZ with the same settings
and analysis cuts as the corresponding NLO calculations of MadGraph5_aMC@NLO.
This approximation is justified since NNLO K-factors depend very mildly on the
input PDF set, see for example [161]. The photon induced contribution, as pro-
vided in [143], has been explicitly subtracted from the FEWZ predictions. Fig. 4.6
shows the K-factors of Eq. (4.1) corresponding to the double differential (m``, |y``|)
cross sections as a function of the di-lepton rapidity |y``|, where each set of points
corresponds to a different di-lepton invariant mass m`` bin. The vertical bars on
each point represent the statistical uncertainty on the calculated K-factors.
The K-factors vary between 0.98 and 1.04, highlighting the fact that higher-order
4.4 Fit settings
corrections to the Drell-Yan process are moderate, in particular at low values of
m`` and in the central region. Even at forward rapidities, the K-factors modify the
NLO result by at most 4%.
4.4 Fit settings
In order to make a full PDF fit, the ATLAS DY data are fitted together with the
final combined inclusive cross section data from HERA. The DGLAP equations
yield the PDFs at all scales if they are input as functions of x at a starting scale Q20,
which should be large enough that perturbative QCD can be assumed to be valid.
For the present analysis this value is chosen to be Q20 = 7.5 GeV
2. This is also the
value chosen for the minimum value of Q2 for data entering the fit. The value of
s(MZ) is chosen to be s(MZ) = 0.118.
The charm PDF is then generated perturbatively from quarks and gluons by means
of DGLAP evolution, exploiting recent developments in APFEL which allow the
setting of heavy-quark thresholds h differently from the heavy quark masses mh,
such that c = Q0 > mc. Hence a high threshold can be used without having to
parametrise the charm PDF [141].
The expression for the 2 function used for the fits is that of Ref. [162], which
includes corrections for possible biases from statistical fluctuations and treats the
systematic uncertainties multiplicatively, and it is also shown in Eq. 4.2:
Di  Ti
2i,uncT
i + 
i,statDiTi
2i,uncT
i + 
i,statDiTi
2i,uncD
i + 
i,statD
, (4.2)
where Ti is the theoretical prediction and Di the measured value of the i-th data
point, i,stat, i,unc, and ij are the relative statistical, uncorrelated systematic, and
correlated systematic uncertainties, and bj are the nuisance parameters associated
to the correlated systematics which are determined during the fit.
Alternative forms that do not include these corrections, such as those defined
in [24, 34], have also been studied but no significant differences in the results have
been observed.
In this analysis, the parametrised PDFs are the valence distributions xuv(x,Q20) and
xdv(x,Q
0), the gluon distribution xg(x,Q
0), and the u-type and d-type sea-quark
distributions, xU(x,Q20), xD(x,Q
0), where xU(x,Q
0) = xu(x,Q
0) and xD(x,Q
xd(x,Q20) + xs(x,Q
0). The photon distribution x(x,Q
0) is also parametrised at
the starting scale. The following general functional form is adopted:
xf(x) = AxB(1 x)C(1 +Dx+ Ex2) (4.3)
where some of the normalisation parameters, in particular Auv , Adv and Ag, are
constrained by the valence and momentum sum rules. Note that the photon PDF
also enters the momentum sum rule. The parameters BU and BD are set equal
to each other, so that the two quark sea distributions share a common small-x
behaviour. Since the measurements used here are not sensitive to the strangeness
content of the proton, strangeness is fixed such that xs(x,Q20) = rsxd(x,Q
0), where
4.4 Fit settings
the strangeness fraction rs = 1.0 is consistent with the ATLAS analysis of inclusive
W andZ production [163,164]. The further constraintAU = 0.5AD is imposed, such
that xu(x,Q20)  xd(x,Q20) as x  0. The explicit form of PDF parametrisation
Eq. (4.3) at the scale Q20 is determined by the technique of saturation of the 
namely the number of parameters is increased one by one until the 2 does not
improve further, employing Wilks theorem [165]. Following this method, the
optimal parametrisation for the quark and gluon PDFs found for this analysis is:
xuv(x) = Auvx
Buv (1 x)Cuv (1 + Euvx2) ,
xdv(x) = Advx
Bdv (1 x)Cdv ,
xU(x) = AUx
BU (1 x)CU , (4.4)
xD(x) = ADx
BD(1 x)CD ,
xg(x) = Agx
Bg(1 x)Cg(1 + Egx2) ,
while for the photon PDF it is used:
x(x) = Ax
B (1 x)C (1 +Dx+ Ex2) . (4.5)
The parametrisation of the quark and gluon PDFs in Eq. (4.5) differs from the one
used in the HERAPDF2.0 analysis in various ways. First of all, a higher value
of the input evolution scale Q20 is used, which is helpful to stabilise the fit of the
photon PDF. Second, an additional negative term in the parametrisation of the
gluon is not required here, because of the increased value of Q20 which assures the
positiveness of the gluon distribution. Third, the results of the parametrisation
scan are different because of the inclusion of the ATLAS high-mass DY cross-
section data. PDF uncertainties are estimated using the Monte Carlo (MC) replica
method [166168], cross-checked with the Hessian method [36] using 2 = 1.
The former is expected to be more robust than the latter, due to the potential
non-Gaussian nature of the photon PDF uncertainties [149]. In the following, it
will be shown that these two methods to estimate the PDF uncertainties on the
photon PDF lead to similar results.
In addition, a number of cross-checks have been performed to assess the impact
of various model and parametrisation uncertainties. For the model uncertainties,
variations of the charm mass between mc = 1.41 GeV to 1.53 GeV, of the bottom
mass between mc = 4.25 GeV to 4.75 GeV, of the strong coupling constant s(mZ)
between 0.116 to 0.120 are considered, and additionally the strangeness fraction
is decreased down to rs = 0.75. For the parametrisation uncertainties, the impact
of increasing the input parametrisation scale up to Q20 = 10 GeV
2 is considered
as well as the impact of including additional parameters in Eq. (4.5). These extra
parameters make little difference to the 2 of the fit, but they can change the shape
of the PDFs in a non-negligible way. Such additional parameters are Duv , Du, Ed,
as well and the extra negative term in the gluon PDF used in HERAPDF2.0. The
impact of these model and parametrisation uncertainties on the baseline results is
quantified in Sec. 4.5.3.
In the end, Fig. 4.7 and Fig. 4.8 show the u - valence, d - valence, u, d and gluon
PDF distributions at Q2 = 7.5 GeV2and Q2 = 104 GeV2 respectively. Here, the PDFs

4.5 Results
4.5.1 Fit quality and comparison between data and fit results
In the following, the results that will be shown correspond to those obtained
from fitting the double-differential (m``, |y``|) cross-section distributions. It has
been verified that comparable results are obtained if the (m``,``) cross-section
distributions are fitted instead.
For the baseline NNLO fit, the value 2min/Ndof = 1284/1083 is obtained where
Ndof is the number of degrees of freedom in the fit which is equal to total number
of data points minus number of free parameters. The contribution from the HERA
inclusive data is 2/Ndat = 1236/1056 and from the ATLAS high-mass DY data is
2/Ndat = 48/48, where Ndat the number of the data points for the corresponding
data sample. These values for 2/Ndat, together with the corresponding values for
the various invariant massm`` bins of the ATLAS data, are summarised in Table 4.1.
The quality of the agreement with the HERA cross sections is of comparable quality
to that found in the HERAPDF2.0 analysis. Note that in the calculation of the total
2 for the ATLAS data, the correlations between the different m`` bins have been
taken into account.
Fig. 4.9 demonstrate a good agreement between ATLAS data and the NNLO
theory predictions obtained from the xFitter_epHMDY fit. This agreement is
also quantitatively expressed by the values of the 2 reported in Table 4.1, where
for the ATLAS data a 2/Ndat = 1 is found. This is particularly remarkable given
the high precision of the data, with total experimental uncertainties at the few
percent level in most of the kinematic range.
The output parameters from the NNLO fit are reported in Table 4.2.

4.5.2 Determination of the photon PDF
In Fig. 4.10, the photon PDF, x(x,Q2), is shown at Q2 = 104 GeV2, and it is
compared to the corresponding LUXqed, HKR16 and NNPDF3.0QED results. In
the left plot the comparison is presented in an absolute scale, while in the right
plot the ratio of different results normalized to the central value of the fit is shown.
For the present fit, xFitter_epHMDY, the experimental PDF uncertainties at the
68% confidence level (CL) are obtained from the MC method, while model and
parametrisation uncertainties are discussed below. Likewise, the NNPDF3.0QED
PDF set is shown the 68% CL uncertainty band, while for LUXqed the associated
PDF uncertainty band is computed according to the prescription of Ref. [52]. For
HKR16, only the central value is available. The x-range in Fig. 4.10 has been re-
stricted to the region 0.02  x  0.9, since beyond that region there is only limited
sensitivity to x(x,Q2). Fig. 4.10 shows that for x  0.1 the four determinations of
he photon PDF are consistent within PDF uncertainties at the 1- level. For smaller
values of x, the photon PDF from LUXqed and HKR16 is somewhat smaller than
xFitter_epHMDY, but still in agreement at the 2- level. This agreement is further
improved if the PDF uncertainties in xFitter_epHMDY arising from variations
of the input parametrisation are added to experimental uncertainties, as discussed
in the following. Moreover, the results shown in this chapter and NNPDF3.0QED
agree at the 68% CL for x  0.03, and the agreement extends to smaller values of
x once the parametrisation uncertainties in xFitter_epHMDY are accounted for
(more details in Sec. 4.5.3). The LUXqed and the HKR16 calculations of x(x,Q2)
are very close to each other across the entire range of x. Fig. 4.10 shows that for
0.04  x  0.2 the present analysis exhibits smaller PDF uncertainties as com-
pared to those from NNPDF3.0QED. Indeed, the experimental uncertainty on the
xFitter_epHMDY turns out to be at the  30% level for x  0.1. At larger x it

increases rapidly specially in the positive direction. The reason for this behaviour
at large x can be understood by recalling that variations of x(x,Q2) in the nega-
tive direction are constrained by positivity. The limited sensitivity of the ATLAS
data does not allow a determination of x(x,Q2) with uncertainties competitive
with those of LUXqed, which are at the few percent level. These results became
available while this analysis was underway. Nevertheless, it is valuable to see
that the present model independent evaluation of the photon PDF, including the
high-mass DY data, can improve on the similar model independent analysis of
NNPDF3.0, which lacks these data.
A similar comparison between the NLO photon distribution and the NNPDF3.0qed
NLO photon PDF in the restricted x-range is shown in Fig. 4.11. The comparison
is also made to the CT14qed photon PDF [169]; the bands in the plot represent
the experimental PDF uncertainty 68% C.L. . The NLO fit predictions agree with
CT14qed photon PDF at the 1- level in most of the restricted x-range and the im-
provement in the uncertainty related to the photon PDF, compared that estimated
by NNPDF3.0qed, is quite remarkable.
It is also interesting to assess the impact of the high-mass Drell-Yan 8 TeV mea-
surements on the light quark and gluon PDFs. For this purpose, the fits have
been repeated freezing the photon PDF to the xFitter_epHMDY shape. This is
necessary because HERA inclusive data alone, which are the benchmark for this
comparison, have no sensitivity to the photon PDF. In this way, a meaningful
comparison between the quark and gluon PDFs from a HERA-only baseline and

the HERA+HMDY fit can be performed. This comparison is shown in Fig. 4.12 for
the up and down anti-quarks xu(x,Q2) and xd(x,Q2) PDFs, for which the effect of
the high-mass DY data is expected to be most pronounced, since HERA inclusive
cross sections provide little information on quark flavour separation. In Fig. 4.12,
the xu(x,Q2) and xd(x,Q2) together with the associated MC uncertainties have
been computed at the initial parametrisation scale ofQ2 = 7.5 GeV2 and are shown
as ratios to the central value of the xFitter_epHMDY fit. The modifications in
the medium and large-x antiquark distributions from the high mass DY data are
rather moderate. It has been verified that the same conclusions can be derived
from fits obtained by switching off the QED effects for both the HERA only fits and
the HERA+HMDY fits. Therefore, while the ATLAS high-mass DY measurements
have a significant constraint on the photon PDF, their impact on the quark and

4.5.3 Robustness and perturbative stability checks
Following the presentation of the main result shown in this chapter, the ro-
bustness of this determination with respect to a number of variations is assessed.
Firstly, variations in the values of the input physical parameters, such as s or the
charm mass are explored. Secondly, variations of the choices made for the PDF
input parametrisation are considered. Finally, variations associated to different
methodological choices in the fitting procedure are quantified. In each case, one
variation at a time is performed and compared with the central value of x(x,Q2)
and its experimental PDF uncertainties computed using the MC method.
First the impact of uncertainties associated to either the choice of input physi-
cal parameters or of specific settings adopted in the fit is considered. Fig. 4.13

shows the comparison between the xFitter_epHMDY determination of x(x,Q2)
at Q2 = 104 GeV2, including the experimental MC uncertainties, with the cen-
tral value of those fits for which a number of variations have been performed.
Specifically:
 The strong coupling constant is varied by s = 0.002 around the central
value.
 The ratio of strange to non-strange light quark sea PDFs is decreased to
rs = 0.75 instead of rs = 1.
 The value of the charm mass is varied between mc = 1.41 GeV and mc = 1.53
GeV, and that of the bottom mass between mb = 4.25 GeV and mb = 4.75
 The minimum value Q2min of the fitted data is decreased down to 5 GeV2.
 The input parametrisation scale Q20 is raised to 10 GeV2 as compared to the
baseline value of Q20 = 7.5 GeV
The results of Fig. 4.13 highlight that in all cases effect of the variations consid-
ered here is contained within (and typically much smaller than) the experimental
PDF uncertainty bands of the reference fit. The largest variation comes from the
strangeness ratio rs, where the resulting central value turns out to be at the bottom
end of the PDF uncertainty band for x  0.1. From the 2 point of view, all above
described model variation has a total 2/Ndof which differs just by few units from
the one of the nominal fit; so most of various fit are indistinguishable from each
other in Fig. 4.13.
Another important check of the robustness of the present determination of x(x,Q2)
can be obtained by comparing the baseline fit with further fits where a number of

new free parameters are allowed in the PDF parametrisation, in addition to those
listed in Eq. (4.5). Fig. 4.14 shows the impact of three representative variations
(others have been explored, leading to smaller differences): more flexibility to the
gluon distribution, introducing a negative counter term (labelled by neg), in
addition to Duv , and then Du +Dd. As before, all variations are contained within
the experimental PDF uncertainty bands, though the impact of the parametrisa-
tion variations is typically larger than that of the model variations: in the case of
the neg + Du + Dd variations, the central value is at the lower edge of the PDF
uncertainty band in the entire range of x shown.
A cross-check of the robustness of the estimated experimental uncertainty of the
photon PDF in this analysis is provided by the comparison of the MC replicas
and Hessian methods. Fig. 4.14 shows this comparison indicating a reasonable
agreement between the two methods. In particular, the central values of the pho-
ton obtained with the two fitting techniques are quite similar to each other. As
expected, the MC uncertainties tend to be larger than the Hessian ones, especially
in the region x  0.2, indicating deviations with respect to the Gaussian behaviour
of the photon PDF.
To complete these studies, an interesting exercise is to quantify the perturbative
stability of the xFitter_epHMDY determination of the photon PDF x(x,Q2)
with respect to the inclusion of NNLO QCD corrections in the analysis. To study
this, Fig. 4.15 shows a comparison between the baseline fit of x(x,Q2), based
on NNLO QCD and NLO QED theoretical calculations, with the central value
resulting from a corresponding fit based instead on NLO QCD and QED theory.
In other words, the QED part of the calculations is identical in both cases. For
the NNLO fit, only the experimental PDF uncertainties, estimated using the MC

x(x,Q2) exhibits a reasonable perturbative stability, since the central value of
the NLO fit is always contained in the one-sigma PDF uncertainty band of the
baseline xFitter_epHMDY fit. The agreement between the two fits is particularly
good for x  0.1, where the two central values are very close to each other. This
comparison is shown at low scale, Q2 = 7.5 GeV2 and high scales Q2 = 104 GeV2,
indicating that perturbative stability is not scale dependent.
4.6 Summary of Chapter 4
In this chapter, a new determination of the photon PDF from a fit of HERA
inclusive DIS structure functions supplemented by ATLAS data on high-mass
Drell-Yan cross sections has been presented, based on the xFitter framework.
As suggested by a previous reweighting analysis [143], this high-mass DY data
provides significant constraints on the photon PDF, allowing a determination of
x(x,Q2) with uncertainties at the 30% level for 0.02  x  0.1. The results of the
present study, dubbed xFitter_epHMDY, are in agreement and exhibit smaller
PDF uncertainties that the only other existing photon PDF fit from LHC data, the
NNPDF3.0QED analysis, based on previous LHC Drell-Yan measurements. The
results are in agreement within uncertainties with two recent calculations of the
photon PDF, LUXqed and HKR16. For x  0.1, the agreement is at the 1- level
already including only the experimental MC uncertainties, while for 0.02  x  0.1
it is important to account for parametrisation uncertainties. The findings indicate

BSM search in the di-electron
channel at
s = 13 TeV
The di-lepton (ee and ) final-state signature has excellent sensitivity to a
wide variety of new phenomena expected in theories beyond the Standard Model
(BSM). It benefits from high signal selection efficiencies and relatively small, well-
understood backgrounds. My own contributions were on the optimization of the
cuts applied in the event selection in the electron channel, the validation study of
the higher order k-factors (NNLO QCD + NLO EW)/(NLO QCD + LO EW) and
setting exclusion limits on the Z
production cross section times branching ratio
to two leptons as a function of Z
pole mass in various different BSM scenarios.
Given the fact that my contribution to this search was in the di-electron channel,
only results in this specific channel or combined results will be shown in the
following, without any particular emphasis on the results in the other decay
channel. The focus of this chapter is on my contributions; however, in order to
make them understandable and to put them into context, a concise account of
all stages involved in obtaining the results is included. During the period I got
involved in this BSM search, I contributed to two ATLAS CONF notes [171, 172]
and two papers [76, 86].
5.1 Data and MC samples
The ATLAS software release 20.7 was used for reconstructing both MC events
and the data. The detector response is simulated with GEANT4 [173,174]. Reweight-
ing of events in MC to match the data according to the trigger, isolation, and
reconstruction efficiency are also included.
5.1.1 Background processes
The data sample used in this analysis was collected during the 2015 and 2016
LHC runs with pp collisions at
s = 13 TeV. After selecting periods with stable
beams and requiring that relevant detector systems are functional, the data set
used for the analysis corresponds to 36.1 fb1 of integrated luminosity. Event qual-
5.1 Data and MC samples
ity is also checked to remove those events which contain noise bursts or coherent
noise in the calorimeters.
Modelling of the various background sources relies primarily on Monte Carlo
(MC) simulation. The dominant background contribution arises from the Drell-Yan
(DY) [175] process. Other background sources are tt, single-t [3] and diboson (WW,
WZ, ZZ) [176] production. In the case of the di-electron channel, multi-jet and
W+jets processes also contribute due to the misidentification of jets as electrons.
A data driven method, described in the following, is used to estimate these back-
ground contributions.
DY events are simulated using Powheg-box_v2 [177] at next-to-leading order
(NLO) in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), and interfaced to the Pythia
v8.186 [178] parton shower model. The CT10 partonic distribution function
(PDF) set [179] is used in the matrix element calculation. The AZNLO [180] set
of tuned parameters ("tune") is used, with the CTEQ6L1 PDF set [181], for the
modelling of non-perturbative effects. Event yields are corrected with a mass-
dependent rescaling to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in the QCD coupling
constant, computed with VRAP_v0.9 [182] and the CT14NNLO PDF set [183].
The NNLO QCD corrections are a factor of  0.98 at mll = 3 TeV. Mass-dependent
electroweak (EW) corrections are computed at NLO with MCSANC_v1.20 [184].
The NLO EW corrections are a factor of  0.86 at mll = 3 TeV. Those include
photon-induced contributions (  ll via t- and u-channel processes) computed
with the MRST2004QED PDF set [48]. The quantity NNLO_QCD+NLO_EW (numerator
of the kF expression) can be obtained in two different ways:
 factored computation: the kF are fully multiplicative and
NNLO_QCD+NLO_EW = kQCD  kEW  LO_QCD,LO_EW (5.1)
with kQCD = NNLO_QCD/LO_QCD (computed with VRAP_v0.9) and kEW =
HO_EW/LO_QCD,EW (computed with MCSANC_v1.20),
 additive computation: the HO cross section is constructed as follows:
NNLO_QCD+NLO_EW = NNLO_QCD 
LO_QCD,EW  LO_QCD
NNLO_QCD
(5.2)
Di-boson processes with four charged leptons, three charged leptons and one
neutrino, or two charged leptons and two neutrinos are simulated using the
Sherpa_v2.1.1 generator [185]. Matrix elements contain all diagrams with four
electroweak vertices. They are calculated for up to one (4l, 2l + 2) or no ad-
ditional partons (3l + 1) at NLO. Di-boson processes with one of the bosons
decaying hadronically and the other leptonically also are simulated using the
Sherpa_v2.1.1 generator. They are calculated for up to one (ZZ) or no (WW,WZ)
additional partons at NLO. The CT10 PDF set is used in conjunction with dedi-
cated parton shower tuning developed by the Sherpa authors.
For the generation of tt and single top quarks in the Wt-channel and s-channel
the Powheg-box_v2 generator with the CT10 PDF set in the matrix element cal-
culations is used. EW t-channel single-top-quark events are generated using the
5.2 Event selection
Powheg-box_v1 generator. This generator uses the four-flavour scheme for the
NLO matrix element calculations together with the fixed four-flavour PDF set
CT10f4. The parton shower, fragmentation, and the underlying event are simu-
lated using Pythia v6.428 [186] with the CTEQ6L1 PDF set and the Perugia
2012 tune [187]. The top-quark mass (mtop) is set to 172.5 GeV. The tt and single-
top-quark MC samples are normalised to a cross-section as calculated with the
Top++2.0 [188] program, which is accurate to NNLO in perturbative QCD, in-
cluding resummation of next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) soft gluon
terms.
5.1.2 Signal processes
Dedicated Z  signal samples were generated at LO using Pythia8.186 with
the NNPDF23LO PDF [148] and A14 tune [189] for event generation, parton show-
ering and hadronisation. Samples were created for four polemasses, respectively
2, 3, 4 and 5 TeV, for benchmarking the Z  model and at 3 TeV for the Z
SSM . The
Pythia8 generator was also used to produce the CI signal samples at LO using
the NNPDF23LO PDF were produced using the Pythia8 generators and five
benchmark values of  (every 5 TeV starting from 10 TeV and up to 30 TeV) were
generated for each of the CI models, in both the destructive and constructive
interference scenarios.
The strategy for producing these signal templates is based upon reweighting LO
DY to create Z  and CI signal templates for a model at any given value of Z  pole-
mass, or CI value of . The reweighting algorithm to the LO DY samples takes as
input on an event-by-event basis: the event born mass, the flavour of the incoming
quarks and the desired Z  polemass or  value. Then, for that event, the Feynman
diagrams at LO for both the SM DY and BSM Z /CI model and the reweighting
function returns a ratio of the two, which is applied to the event as a weight
and transforms the SM DY spectrum into the desired model. This reweighting
techinque is codified in the LPXSignalReweightingTool, a package avilable
in RootCore and designed in such a way to be plugged directly in the analysis
workflow. Ref. [190] gives a detailed explanation of this reweighting technique
and how to set it up with specific examples.
An example of the Z  and CI templates produced with this technique can be found
in Fig. 5.1.
5.2 Event selection
The selected events are required to be in the list of good runs1,2. Events are
required to have at least one reconstructed primary vertex and at least one pair
of same-flavour lepton candidates. Then, the selected events have to pass a two-
electron trigger based on the Loose identification criteria with an ET threshold of
17 GeV for each electron and the LAr, Tile and SCT requirements which provide

protection against data corruption and noise bursts in the calorimeters. Finally, an
event is selected if it contains at least two electrons.
Electrons are reconstructed in the central region of the ATLAS detector covered
by the tracking detectors (|| < 2.47), by combining calorimetric and tracking
information. The transition region between the central and forward regions of the
calorimeters, in the range 1.37  ||  1.52, exhibits degraded energy resolution
and is therefore excluded. Electrons must not flagged as coming from a bad
calorimeter cluster, furthermore to search for high-mass di-lepton signatures of
new physics, requirements are applied to the data and MC samples to select events
with two high-ET electrons, satisfying the criteria described below:
 They must have ET > 30 GeV;
 They must pass the ID track requirement on the d0 significance:
|dBL0 /(d
0 )| < 5;
 They must pass the ID track requirement |z0 sin()| < 0.5 mm with respect
to the beam line;
 They must pass the "Likelihood Medium" identification criteria based on
track and shower-shape variables;
 They must pass the "Loose" isolation criteria.
Only the electron pair with the highest scalar sum of ET is retained in each event;
the opposite-charge requirement is not applied in the di-electron channel due to
the high chance of charge misidentification for high-ET electrons.
The electron event selection yield for the 2015 and 2016 datasets after requiring
the final selection is shown in Fig. 5.2.

5.3 MC background estimation
The SM processes producing two real leptons in the final state are modelled and
estimated using Monte Carlo (MC) simulated samples as described in Section 5.1.
The processes for which MC simulation is used are: DY, tt and single-top-quark,
and di-boson (WW,WZ, and ZZ) production. The event selection is applied to
each of the MC samples representing these backgrounds, which are subsequently
scaled to the same integrated luminosity. Scale factors are applied to the MC distri-
butions to correct them with respect to the collected data, and are mostly derived
by the combined performance groups in several bins of ET and ||. The scale
factors correct for the trigger, electron ID, isolation, and reconstruction efficiencies.
5.4 Fake electron background estimation
As regards the W+jets, multi-jet and other production processes, where at most
one real electron is produced, nevertheless contribute to the selected ee sample
due to their having one or more hadronic jets satisfying the electron selection
criteria. The contribution from these processes is estimated simultaneously with a
data-driven (DD) technique, called the matrix method.
5.4.1 The matrix method
This methodology is based upon loosening certain identification criteria ap-
plied in the nominal selection, to estimate the rate with which those looser objects
pass the nominal selection. In this way, the signal contamination by misidentified
jets can be determined. In this method, two different electron selections are de-
5.4 Fake electron background estimation
fined: a tight (T) one and a loose (L) one. Note that the set of objects passing the
tight selection, Ntight, is a subset of those passing the loose criteria, Nloose.
In this analysis, only pairs of electron candidates denoted by Nxy (where x, y 
T, L) are considered. In this way, the number of electron pairs passing four differ-
ent selection are measurable: NTT , NTL, NLT and NLL. The first index represents
the leading object (pT,lead > pT,sub) and the second one the sub-leading. The relation
between these reconstructed quantities and the real ones denoted by Nab with
a, b  R,F which refers to whether the object is a real electron or a fake one is
shown is Eq. 5.3.

(1 r)r (1 r)f (1 f)r (1 f)f
(1 r)2 (1 r)(1 f) (1 f)(1 r) (1 f)2
 (5.3)
To be considered, the real objects are required to pass at least the lhLoose identifica-
tion criteria (see Sec. 3.3.2 for the definition of this working point). The quantities
in the vector on the right hand side of Eq. 5.3 are true quantities and they are not
experimentally measurable. These true quantities are exclusive which means that
for example NRR does not contain any other components like NRF . The vector on
the left hand side of the equation is exclusive, but measurable, which means for
example that NTT does not contain components of NTL as well. In Eq. 5.3, the fake
and the real rate are represented by the coefficient f and r respectively and they
are determined as follows:
tight
loose
N realtight
N realloose
(5.4)
Here,N realtight (N
loose) is the number of real electrons passing the tight (loose) selection.
tight (N
loose) give the corresponding numbers for fake electrons. So, the real
rate stands for the probability for a real electron to be reconstructed as "tight"-
electron and the fake rate denotes the probability for a fake selected as loose to
be reconstructed as tight. The objects passing the loose selection need to pass the
trigger used in the analysis, while the tight objects have to fulfil all cuts of the
loose selection and additionally the lhMedium identification and an isolation cut.
NTT , which represents the number of events reconstructed as signal but originated
from a pair of objects containing at least one fake, is our quantity of interest. This
is described in Eq. 5.5 following the first line of Eq. 5.3.

Eq. 5.5 depends on inaccessible truth quantities. These true variables can be

5.4.2 Real rate determination
A sample of real electrons is need for the determination of the real rate r. This
rate is determined from DY simulation and it is calculated in bins of pT and ||.
Fig. 5.3 shows this determination. The real rate is found to be greater than  90%

5.4.3 Fake efficiency determination
The fake rate is calculated using fake electrons in data. A fake enriched sample
is obtained by requiring events which satisfy a single electron trigger with a
loose identification criteria (lhLoose) or a very loose one (lhLoose). To reduce the
real electron contamination in this sample, a cut on EmissT > 25 GeV is imposed
to suppress real electrons from W decays. Furthermore, in order to suppress
real electrons from DY events, a cut on the reconstructed invariant mass, mreco, is
5.5 Electron identification
imposed, vetoing events with |mrecoZ mreco|< 20 GeV. Despite the above-described
cuts, the contribution of real electrons cannot be neglected. These contributions
are estimated with DY, W + jets, Di-boson and Top MC simulation and subtracted
from N fakeloose and N

determined as a function of pT and ||. The fake rates are  20% in the low pT

5.5 Electron identification
The choice of the electron identification criteria has been optimised comparing
the different likelihood-based working points (WPs) provided by the e/ per-
formance group, namely: Loose, Medium and Tight. The signal efficiency was
tested on the SM DY MC, while the background rejection was tested on di-jet MC:
Fig. 5.5 shows these efficiencies as a function of the di-lepton invariant mass mll.
This study shows that "Likelihood Loose" and "Likelihood Medium" provide a similar
performance in terms of signal efficiency compared to background rejection for
the di-lepton search. Ultimately, the Medium working point is chosen for the
nominal event selection, given the fact that it makes the analysis slightly more
robust against fake electrons.
5.6 Systematic Uncertainties
A flat uncertainty of 3.2% is assessed due to the uncertainty on the luminosity
scale. Mass-dependent systematic uncertainties are considered as nuisance pa-

rameters and include both the theoretical and experimental effects on the total
background and experimental effects on the signal. They are assessed as a function
of the di-lepton invariant mass and for each source of systematic uncertainty the
largest of the up/down variations is taken. This variation is then treated as being a
symmetric up/down variation versus di-lepton invariant mass, and is the quantity
which is used in the statistical interpretation.
The systematic uncertainties related to electron energy/momentum scale and reso-
lution, as well as the identification, trigger, reconstruction and isolation efficiency,
were provided by the e/ group official recommendations, as described in Sec. 5.3.
The data-driven estimate of the number of events containing at least one fake
electron which mimics the signal (as described in Sec. 5.4) has a relatively large
uncertainty at high di-lepton invariant masses. The uncertainty on this estimate is
assessed by variation of the methodology and calculated rate of fake electrons. To
cover these effects, the systematic uncertainty on the data-driven estimate is calcu-
lated by scaling the default fake background estimate by 1 and taking the ratio
between this and the nominal estimate when included in the total background
estimate.
Theoretical uncertainties in the background prediction are dominated by the DY
background in this search. They arise from the PDF eigenvector variations of
the nominal PDF set, as well as variations of PDF scale, S , EW corrections, and
photon-induced (PI) corrections. The effects of different PDF set choices are also
considered. The PDF variation uncertainty is obtained using the 90% confidence
level CT14NNLO PDF error set. Rather than using a single nuisance parameter to
describe the 28 eigenvectors of this PDF error set, which could lead to an underes-
timation of its effect, a re-diagonalised set of 7 PDF eigenvectors was used, which
are treated as separate nuisance parameters. The sum in quadrature of these eigen-
vectors matches the original CT14NNLO error envelope well. The uncertainties
due to the variation of PDF scale and S are derived using VRAP with the former
obtained by varying the renormalisation ( R ) and factorisation ( F ) scales of
the nominal CT14NNLO PDF up and down simultaneously by a factor of two.
5.7 Event yields
The value of S used (0.118) is varied by  0.003. An additional uncertainty is
derived due to the choice of nominal PDF set, by comparing the central values of
CT14NNLO with those from other PDF sets as recommended by the PDF4LHC
forum [191], namely MMHT14 [192] and NNPDF3.0 [50]. The maximum absolute
deviation from the envelope of these comparisons is used as the PDF choice uncer-
tainty, where it is larger than the CT14NNLO PDF eigenvector variation envelope.
Theoretical uncertainties are not applied to the signal prediction.
Theoretical uncertainties in the tt and di-boson backgrounds were also considered.
The tt MC sample is normalised to a cross-section of tt = 832
29 (scale)  35 (
PDF + S ) pb, with the Top++ program, as described in Section 5.1. The first
uncertainty comes from the independent variation (up and down simultaneously
by a factor of two) of the factorisation and renormalisation scales, F and R,
while the second one is associated to variations in the PDF and S , following
the PDF4LHC prescription. Normalisation uncertainties in the top quarks and
di-boson background were found to be negligible. The uncertainties in the top-
quark and di-boson background extrapolations are estimated by varying both
the functional form and the fit range, taking the envelope of all variations. These
normalisation uncertainties were also found to be negligible with respect to the
total background estimate.
The EW correction systematic uncertainty was assessed by comparing the additive
versus factored computation of the EW kF , where the additive computation is
used as the nominal in this search (for the definition of these two methods, please
see Sec. 5.1.1). The size of the uncertainty is 4% at di-lepton invariant masses of
3 TeV.
Systematic uncertainties used in the statistical analysis of the results are sum-
marised in Table 5.1 at di-electron mass values of 2 TeV and 4 TeV.
5.7 Event yields
Expected and observed event yields, in bins of invariant mass, are shown in
Table 5.2. Expected event yields are split into the different background sources and
the yields for two signal scenarios. The DY process is dominant over the entire
mass range. In general, the observed data are in good agreement with the SM
prediction, taking uncertainties into account, as described in the previous section.
The di-electron invariant mass distributions, mee, are shown in Fig. 5.6, as well
as the ET ,  and  of both selected electrons in the signal region (mee > 120 GeV)
in Fig. 5.7. No significant excess is observed. The highest invariant mass event is
found at mee = 2.90 TeV in the di-electron channel; this event appear to be very
clean with little other detector activity, as it is shown in Fig. 5.8.
5.8 Statistical analysis
Two complementary approaches are used to quantify the significance of an
excess between the expected and observed data, namely: a log-likelihood ratio
(LLR) test, which utilises signal templates for the different models under investi-

Table 5.1: Summary of the relative systematic uncertainties in the expected number of
events at a di-electron mass of 2 TeV (4 TeV). The values quoted for the uncertainty
represent the relative change in the total expected number of events in the bin containing
the reconstructed mee mass of 2 TeV (4 TeV). For the signal uncertainties the values were
computed using a Z
 signal model with a pole mass of 2 TeV (4 TeV) by comparing
yields in the core of the mass peak (within the full width at half maximum) between the
distribution varied by the considered uncertainty and the nominal distribution. The total
uncertainty quoted on the last line is obtained from a sum in quadrature of the individual
uncertainties. "N/A" represents cases where the uncertainty is not applicable.

gation, providing local and global significances, and a BumpHunter/TailHunter
Tool, which effectively scans the di-lepton invariant mass spectrum for any local
resonant/non-resonant signal-like excess, providing the corresponding global
significance.
5.8.1 Likelihood-ratio test
The probability that the background fluctuates creating a signal-like excess
equal to or larger than what is observed defines the importance of an excess and it
is denoted as p0 (p-value). p0 is computed using a test statistic defined as follows:
0 for  < 0,
2 ln
L(data|0,0)
L(data|,)
for  > 0,
(5.9)
where 0 represents the nuisance parameters for the null (no signal-like) hypothesis
and  for a given  value (so called signal strength). The parameter  is defined as a
ratio of the signal production cross-section times branching ratio in the di-electron
final state ( B) to its theoretically predicted value.
The more important an excess, the larger the difference between the two likeli-
hoods considered in this equation and the larger is the corresponding q0 value. The
probability p0 corresponding to a given experimental observation qobs is evaluated
as follows:
p0 = P (q0 > q
0 |background-only) =
qobs0
f(q0|0, obs0 )dq0 (5.10)
5.9 Results
Usually, the p0 values are translated to a scale of significance (Z), or number of
standard deviations. It is done by using the inverse of the cumulative function for
the normal Gaussian  [193],
Z = 1(1 p0) (5.11)
For example, in the background-only hypothesis, the probability to have an excess
with 5 significance (Z = 5) is p0 = 3  107; 5 is conventionally the significance
required for claiming the observation of a new particle.
Moreover, to account for the "look elsewhere effect", we report the global p-value
that is the probability of observing a fluctuation somewhere in the entire back-
ground invariant mass spectrum which is at least as significant as the smallest local
p-value measured in data. The global p-value accounts for the increased possibility
of observing positive background fluctuations when looking for signals at a range
of masses. Extensive cross-checks were performed over the whole mass spectrum,
and all the deficits or excesses were quantified by calculating the local Poisson
p-value, using the sources of systematic uncertainty described in Section 5.6, which
gives a significance less than two standard deviations for each mass interval. The
distribution of the observed p-value for a Z
 in the di-electron channel, as well as
the one for the combined channel (ee and ) is presented in Fig. 5.9.
To perform this LLR search, the HistFactory package [194], together with RooSt-
ats [195] and RooFit [196] packages are used.
5.8.2 BumpHunter
The BumpHunter [197] method quantifies the probability to observed an ex-
cess in the observed data from the background prediction. The strength of this
method is in the fact that a precise model is not necessary and it relies just on the
assumption that signal will present as an excess over the background prediction
in several contiguous bins of the histogram of the variable of interest - in our
case the di-lepton mass. The minimal width of search interval is set to two bins
and the maximum search interval is set to half the number of bins in the input
distribution: these are the defaults search windows explored in this search. The
p-value is computed in each of these intervals.
The di-electron invariant mass distribution with the observed data overlayed on
the combined background prediction as well as the local significance (lower panel)
is shown in Fig. 5.10, where a pair of blue lines indicates the interval with the
smallest p-value to observe as many or more events as actually observed given the
background expectation. The common ATLAS BumpHunter implementation is
used in this analysis.
5.9 Results
The statistical tests described in the previous section do not reveal a signal.
So, in the absence of any significant excess, limits are set on the respective signal
models parameter of interest, . For each signal region the total number of

nuisance parameters that account for systematic uncertainties on the number of

of the Z  pole mass in the resonance search, and the energy scale  and interference
parameter LL in the case of the CI search.

the limit on ns is converted into an upper limits on cross-section times branching
ratio (Z ) B(X  `+`) by scaling with the observed number of Z boson events
and the know value of  B(Z  `+`):  B(X) = nSLA(X) , where:
 L is the integrated luminosity of the data
 A(X) is the total acceptance times efficiency for a given signal template for
the parameter of interest X .

is present, are quoted as the expected limits. The upper limits on the  B in a Z 
model are set at 95% credibility limit (C.L.) and they are presented in Fig. 5.11. The
upper limits on  B for Z  bosons start to weaken above a pole mass of 3 TeV.
This is mainly due to the combined effect of a rapidly-falling signal cross-section
as the kinematic limit is approached, and the natural width of the resonance.
Furthermore, lower limits are set at 95% C.L. on the energy scale scale , for the LL,
LR, RL, and RR CI model. Both constructive and destructive interference scenarios
are explored, as well as priors of 1/2. Limits are presented for the di-electron and

Chapter6
Low mass Drell-Yan double
differential cross section
This study has been produced in collaboration between myself and some
members of the ATLAS collaboration. In this analysis, I was the main analyser so I
contributed to all the main aspects of the analysis, apart from the studies related
to the trigger efficiencies and trigger scale factors determination, performed by a
student and a senior researcher from "Sapienza" University of Rome.
The cross section for the process Z/   is presented in terms of both the
single-differential (1D) invariant-mass distribution, d/dm, as well as double
differential (2D) distributions in m and |y|, namely d2/dmd|y|. These
differential cross section are measured in proton-proton collision at
s = 13 TeV
at the LHC using the ATLAS detector. The measurements are performed in the
-channel only for invariant masses between 7 GeV and 66 GeV (with the invariant
mass interval between 9 and 12 GeV excluded) using an integrated luminosity of
1.6 fb1, corresponding to the full dataset collected in 2015. The cross sections are
determined within fiducial acceptance regions.
The kinematic range of the measurement can be seen in Fig. 6.1, where the region
bounded in black represents the kinematic range accessible with ATLAS, for
comparison with other experiments. The lower limit in mass, M, is fixed by the
minimum thresholds for triggering low-pT leptons, and the limits on the rapidity,
y, are set by the pseudo-rapidity acceptance for leptons. This accessible region
allows a measurement to be made between the kinematic regions accessible to the
LHCb and HERA. The region of low x, x  104, is interesting phenomenologically
since novel effects in perturbative QCD, such as ln(1/x) (BFKL) resummation or
non-linear evolution equations may become important. Value of x  104 are only
accessible at HERA for low scale Q = M ' 3 GeV, where non-perturbative effects
may mask and new perturbative contributions. However at the LHC, this low-x
region is well inside the perturbative regime. This particular region of small x and
small M is interesting phenomenologically where novel QCD effects may become
important.
Indeed, some tension was observed at low Q2 such that the 2 for the fits to the
final combined inclusive cross-section data from the HERA experiments H1 and
ZEUS drops steadily as the minimum four-momentum squared Q2min of the data
6.1 Data and MC samples
entering the fit is raised up fromQ2min  3.5 GeV2 toQ2min  10 GeV2 (see Fig. 19 of
Ref. [34]). This turns out to be true for all perturbative orders and is not mitigated
by going to higher order. In particular, the 2 of the NNLO fits is not better than
the NLO fit for low values of Q2min.
A further observation is that the increased 2 of the fits to the low-Q2 data is
largely attributable to the kinematic region of low x and high inelasticity y (where
y = Q2/sx and
s is the centre-of-mass energy) in the neutral-current reduced
cross section data red, defined as:
red = F2 
FL , (6.1)
where, F2 and FL are the structure functions, which are related to the parton
distributions [199], and Y+ = 1 + (1  y)2. In this kinematic region (low Q2 and
low x) the data take a turn-over (see e.g. Fig. 59 of Ref. [34]). This effect can be
ascribed to the negative term proportional to FL in Eq. (6.1). However, fits to data
using fixed-order pQCD do not describe this turn-over very well, suggesting that
a larger FL is needed for a better description.
Recently, an alternative approach which can improve the description of low-Q2
data has been proposed. Since the kinematics of HERA is such that low-Q2 data is
also at low x, it has been suggested that the DGLAP resummation of lnQ2 terms
should be augmented by ln(1/x) (BFKL) resummation [142, 200]. It is interesting
to investigate if such effects are evident in the low-x region probed by ATLAS.
6.1 Data and MC samples
As regards the ATLAS software release, the 20.7 one was used for reconstruct-
ing both MC events and the data. The detector response is simulated with GEANT
4 [173, 174].
The data used for this measurement were recorded between August 16 and Novem-
ber 03, 2015, during data periods D-J. In these periods, the LHC circulated 6.5 TeV
proton beams with 25 ns bunch spacing. In Periods D-J, the peak instantaneous
luminosity was L = 5.1  1033 cm1 s1, and the average number of pileup events
was <  > = 13.5 (for the definition of pileup please refer to Sec. 2.3). The runs
corresponding at the full 25 ns dataset are found in the range 276262-284484. The
data collection is separated into periods in which the trigger conditions remained
stable.
A Good Run List (GRL) consists of a list of luminosity blocks, spanning 1-2 minutes
of data-taking, in which the LHC is circulating stable colliding beams and all criti-
cal detector components are functioning properly. In particular, the inner detector,
the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and the muon spectrometers must
deliver data of high quality to ensure that electrons, muons, jets, and missing trans-
verse energy are measured accurately. The data sample is selected using the follow-
ing GRL: data15_13TeV.periodAllYear_DetStatus-v79-repro20-02_

corresponding lumi tag OflLumi-13TeV-004 is used. The uncertainty on the inte-
grated luminosity is  2.1 %. It is derived, following a methodology similar to that
detailed in Ref. [201], from the final calibration of the luminosity scale using x-y
beam-separation scans performed in August 2015.
Simulated event samples from the MC15c Monte Carlo production campaign
are used. The derivations used are created with release 20.7.5.1.1 for the MC15c
productions using the setup for 25 ns bunch spacing. These above-mentioned
derivations are characterised by the r7773 tag, which corresponds to the -profile
of 2015 data only.
Nearly all of the signal and the electroweak background samples are generated
with the Powheg Monte Carlo (MC) program [177, 202, 203]. Specifically the codes
for single-boson production [45], interfaced with the Pythia v8.1 parton shower
program [178]. The programs used the CT10 parton distribution functions [179]
(PDF) and the AZNLO CTEQ6L1 tune for Powheg+Pythia [204]. This tune was
constructed specifically to describe the low-end of the Z-boson pT spectrum better
than achievable with fixed-order or analytically-resummed calculation. A more
detailed description is provided in Ref. [175]. The Drell-Yan (DY) event yields
are corrected with a rescaling that depends on the di-muon invariant mass from
next-to-leading order (NLO) to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in the strong
coupling constant S , computed with VRAP v0.9 [182] and the CT14NNLO PDF

MCSANC [184], are also applied. Fig. 6.2 presents the above-mentioned corrections

considered as background processes, but in this case no mass-dependent k-factors
are applied. For invariant masses below 10 GeV, any kF is applied because the
higher-order calculations are not available in that low-mass regime2.
In order to check the correct normalisation between the various DY signal samples,
the invariant mass of the di-muon system at Born level has been studied and it is
shown in Fig. 6.3. Here, the following cuts are applied at Born generator level:

tion between the three samples is clearly visible.

ator [205] and Pythia v8.1 [178] (A14 tune [189]), and the production cross

The event samples for exclusive   `+` production are generated using
Herwig++ v2.5.1 [206] event generator. The dominant background samples
for PI single-proton dissociative di-lepton production are generated using Lpair
v4.0 [207]. Depending on the photon virtuality, the proton dissociation in Lpair
is modelled using Suri-Yenni [208] or Brasse [209] structure functions. The Lpair
package is interfaced to Jetset v7.408 [210], where the Lund [211] fragmenta-
tion model is implemented. The Herwig++ and Lpair generators do not include
any corrections to account for proton absorptive effects.
For the double dissociative reactions, Pythia v8.212 [178] is used with the
NNPDF2.3QED [149] photon PDFs as a default option. Depending on the mul-
tiplicity of the dissociating system, the default Pythia8 string or mini-string
fragmentation model is used for proton dissociation. The absorptive effects in
double-dissociative MC events are taken into account using the default multi-
parton interactions model implemented in Pythia8 machinery [212].
QCD multijet bb and cc production samples generated using Pythia v8.1 [178]
(A14 tune [189]) are also considered, as well as the MC samples reproducing
 (1S) +,  (2S) + and  (3S) + events. The former samples
have been filtered at generator level, requiring two muons with pT > 3.5 GeV
and m > 6.0 GeV. The latter samples are considered just in the lowest invariant
mass bin, between 7 and 9 GeV, and they are produced with Pythia v8.1 [178]
interfaced with Photos++ v3.52 [213] and the A14 CTEQ6L1 tune [189]. De-
tails about the baseline and all the background samples used in the analysis are
presented in Table 6.2, where the cross-sections  (before applying filters) and

6.2 Event and object reconstruction
This section describes the selection criteria for all objects used in this analysis,
namely, charged-particle tracks, vertices and muons. The measurement is based
on Analysis Release 2.4.433 where the official performance tools are provided. The
objects used in the measurement are calibrated and the latest scale factors and
corrections are applied to correct the MC selection efficiencies to the ones in data,
following the recommendations of the combined performance groups4.
Muons in ATLAS are reconstructed by combining measurements from the inner
detector (ID) and muon spectrometer (MS). The muon momentum calibration is
applied before any object selection.
Event level selection:
 Event is required to be in the list of good runs.
 Event passes the OR of the following four triggers5
 HLT_mu4_iloose_mu4_7invm9_noos,
 HLT_mu4_iloose_mu4_11invm60_noos,
 HLT_mu6_iloose_mu6_11invm24_noos,
 HLT_mu6_iloose_mu6_24invm60_noos.
 Event is not flagged as being incomplete, and pass LAr and Tile error require-
ments which provide protection against noise bursts and data corruption in
the ECAL and HCAL respectively.
 Event contains at least two combined muons (see Sec. 3.3.1 for the definition
of combined muons).
Combined Muon level selection:
 Muon must have pT > 4.5 GeV,
 Muon must have ||  2.4,

6.2 Event and object reconstruction
 No ID track requirement on |(d0)| and on |z0 sin | with respect to the
beam line for single muon (see Sec. 2.8 for the definition of these quantities),
 Muon passes the "FixedCutTight" isolation criteria (Track isolation require-
ment: ptvarcone30/pT < 0.06; Calorimeter isolation requirement: topoet
cone20/pT < 0.06 - more information about these isolation working points
can be found in Sec. 3.3.1),
 Muon passes the "Medium" quality selection determined by the MuonSelection
Tool6.
Di-muon pair selection:
 Considering only the muon pair with the highest total pT ,
 No opposite-sign (OS) charge requirement applied (in the following, all the
presented distributions are made after the (OS - SS) subtraction),
 Di-muon invariant mass between 7 < m < 9 GeV or 12 < m < 60 GeV.
Moreover, an additional cut on the transverse momentum of the Z boson, pZT > 8
GeV, is applied in the lowest invariant mass bin.
The (OS - SS) subtraction is performed to eliminate the contamination from
W + jets events, which is symmetric in final states with OS or SS muons, and part
of the multijet background.
A cosmic muon fakes two opposite sign muons by travelling through the detec-
tor towards the beam axis and then away from the beam axis. This change of
direction relative to the beam axis means the two fake reconstructed muons are
reconstructed with opposite charge. Due to the fact the two reconstructed muons
are in fact the same cosmic muon, the variable 1 + 
 describing the sum of the 
of the two reconstructed muons will be very close to zero. So, the |1+2| has been
studied (as in Ref. [143]) but it has been found that the cosmic rays contamination
is completely negligible, given the considered low invariant mass range in this
analysis.
6.2.1 Trigger
Several trigger chains are used in this analysis, dependent on the instantaneous
luminosity and the invariant mass of the di-muon pair. All the triggers used in
this analysis were active for instantaneous luminosities below 3  1033 cm2 s1.
These triggers were active at the same time with fixed prescales (PS). The total in-
tegrated luminosity recorded by the HLT_mu6_iloose_mu6_24invm60_noos
and HLT_mu6_iloose_mu6_11invm24_noos (HLT_mu4_iloose_mu4_7inv
m9_noos and HLT_mu4_iloose_mu4_11invm60_noos) is 1280.28 pb1 (319.68
pb1). Table 6.3 shows a summary of all the triggers in use.
The characteristics of the above mentioned 2mu6 (2mu4) triggers are:
 two muons with pT > 6 (4) GeV are required at the L1 level.

 at HLT, an cut on the invariant mass of the di-muon system is applied,
defined by AinvmB, which should be read as follows: A < m < B,
 at HLT, the compatibility of the two muons tracks with the same vertex is
required,
 at HLT, at least one muon passes the Loose isolation criteria. The Loose identi-
fication criteria are designed to maximise the reconstruction efficiency while
providing good-quality muon tracks (e.g. calorimeter, track and combined
isolation of 99%) 7,
 at HLT, there is no opposite-charge requirement.
6.2.2 Corrections to the Monte Carlo modelling
Several corrections are applied to the MC simulation in order to improve its
agreement with data. Reconstruction and isolation efficiencies of muons in MC
are corrected using the MuonEfficiencyCorrections package with the latest
recommendations provided by the MCP group.
Before the reconstruction efficiency can be calculated, a correction must first be
applied to the MC simulation to take into account the mis-modelling of the resolu-
tion response and momentum scale of the muon reconstruction. Dedicated ATLAS
studies have been performed using a "tag and probe" method with muons from Z or
J/ decays in order to measure the difference in momentum scale and momentum
resolution between MC and data [128]. The efficiency of the muon reconstruction
algorithm is also documented in Ref. [128]. The results from this study are also
provided in a software tool (MuonEfficiencyCorrections) within the analy-
sis framework, which is used to retrieve a scale factor to correct for the measured
discrepancy between data and MC. The tool returns a pT ,  and  dependent scale
factor (SF) for each reconstructed muon (calculated after the pT smearing has been
applied).
Trigger SF correcting for the mis-modelling of all the di-muon triggers in the MC
are not applied using the TrigMuonEfficiency package, but they are extracted
using dedicated studies performed by other members of the analysis team. The
impact of these SF on the relevant kinematic distribution is addressed in Sec. 6.2.6.

factor shown in Tab. 6.5 have been applied to produce these plots.
6.2.3 Reconstructed vertices and pile-up corrections
Because of the high LHC peak luminosity and small bunch separation, the num-
ber of proton-proton (pp) interactions occurring in the same bunch crossing is large.
This is referred to as event pile-up and requires the use of dedicated algorithms and
corrections to mitigate its impact on the reconstruction of leptons. The variations
in pile-up conditions in 2015 are included in the simulation of MC events in order
to match the different running conditions and the pile-up distribution observed in
data. Residual differences in the pile-up between data and MC simulation have
been corrected by re-weighting the MC events to reproduce the average number
of interactions per bunch-crossing, <  >, observed in data. This reweighting of
the MC samples is performed using the official PileupReweightingTool [214].
Additionally, the <  > value is scaled by 1/1.09 (with respect to data), based
on studies of the data/MC agreement for the number of reconstructed vertices
vs. <  > (as described here9). The distribution of the number of reconstructed
vertices in data and MC, before and after pile-up reweighting is applied are shown
in Fig. 6.6. It can be seen that the sum of the re-weighted MC samples (solid red
line) almost accurately describes the data distribution.

6.2.4 Z boson transverse momentum modelling
The discrepancy in the ZpT spectrum, due to the well-known mismodelling
of this variable in the Powheg+Pythia simulation (see Ref. [215]), has been in-
spected. To improve the description of the Z pT distribution, re-weighting is
performed using the same data and MC samples as for the comparisons between

at high pT in the Z pT spectrum, the following procedure is used. After having
applied all the selection cuts at reco-level (defined as the information after the re-
construction algorithms have been run over the data from the simulated detector),
the ratio of the data Z pT distribution, after all background MC samples have been
subtracted, and the signal MC was fitted was fitted with a polynomial function of
sixth degree, namely: f(x) = p0 +p1x+p2x2 +p3x3 +p4x4 +p5x5 +p6x6. The fit has
been performed in the pT range [0 - 250] GeV. Then, an event-by-event weight has
been applied using the muon pT at Born-level. These weights have been applied in
such a way that the Z pT reweighting only shuffles events between bins, but does
not overall change the truth level cross section.
This method is first performed in the Z peak control region (CR), defined by

It can be seen from Fig. 6.10 and Fig. 6.11 that the data/MC agreement improves
up to 100 GeV, where the data/MC ratio is close to unity. Then, for invariant
masses greater than 100 GeV, the statistical uncertainties are about 20% or even
bigger. For low di-muon masses (e.g. m < 10 GeV), where the multijet back-

ground is one of the dominant contributions, the data/MC ratio is not fitted well.
It is clear that there was an improvement in the description of the data provided
by the the reweighted MC samples but it is also visible that the achieved gain is
not sufficient to provide a good modelling of the Z pT across the whole transverse
momentum range, especially in the low-pT region. For this preliminary study, the
additional requirement on pZT > 8 GeV in the 7-9 GeV mass bin (as described in
Sec. 6.2) has not been applied, because it has been decided to apply this specific
cut at a later stage of the analysis.
A further improvement can be obtained by considering a mass-dependent reweight-
ing. The above-described procedure is repeated in each invariant mass bins,
namely: 7 to 9 GeV, 12 to 14 GeV, 14 to 17 GeV, 17 to 22 GeV, 22 to 28 GeV,
28 to 36 GeV, 36 to 46 GeV and 46 to 60 GeV. The various fitted functions can be
found in Fig. 6.12. The very highest pT bins are not included in the fit and they are
treated as overflow bins, so a fixed weight equal to the value of the data/MC ratio
in the last bin is applied to every event in that bin. As described in Sec. 6.2, an
additional cut requiring pZT > 8 GeV is applied for 7 < m < 9 GeV. Moreover, in
this particular given mass bin, also the lowest pT bin is not included in the fit but
it is treated as underflow bin (same definition as for the overflow bins just above).
The Z pT distributions after the above-mentioned reweighting are shown in
Fig. 6.13, where now it is clearly visible a good description of the data within
uncertainties. The method to retrieve the data-driven normalisation of the LO
Pythia bb/cc samples will be described Sec. 6.3.7 and the factor shown in Tab. 6.5
have been applied to produce these plots.
In the end, a poor agreement between data and MC can be observed in the 7 to 9
GeV bin, and it is probably due to the wrong normalisation of the MC DY sample
(please refer to Sec. 6.3.1 for further discussion). A more detailed analysis of this
particular bin will follow in Sec. 6.2.8.

6.2 Event and object reconstruction
6.2.5  Control Region
In the nominal selection of the analysis, the invariant mass region between 9
and 12 GeV is excluded because there are many resonances decaying to a muon
pair; in particular, the dominant contribution to the di-muon final state comes
from the following three resonances, namely 1S , 2S and 3S , decaying to +.
A check if the normalisation of these LO Pythia  MC samples is required. The
di-muon invariant mass spectrum between 7.5 and 12 GeV is shown in Fig. 6.14
(left). In this invariant mass region, all the selection criteria are applied, apart from
the trigger selection requirement. The trigger HLT_2mu4_bUpsimumu is used
as the signal region triggers are disabled in the  mass range. The luminosity
recorded by this trigger (2.6 fb1) is higher than the one recorded by the triggers
used in the nominal selection, so both data and MC predictions are scaled to the
HLT_mu6_iloose_mu6_11invm24_noos luminosity, namely 1.3 fb1. Further-
more, a cut on the invariant mass of the di-muon system is applied, selecting
muon pairs having 9 < m < 12 GeV.
In order to find the correct normalisation of the  samples, a TFractionFitter
method [216] is used, where the data are fitted with the 1S , 2S and 3S MC
samples and the sum of all the other MC samples. This method essentially builds
a template from an arbitrary number of MC distribution shapes, and then deter-
mines the fraction of the data contained in each MC category. The only parameters
which can be measured are the fraction for each component, but this method sup-
ports a large number of parameters, and requires only a single MC template for
each component. It uses Poisson statistics, so it works even with low-statistics or
empty bins, in both the data and template. Support for Poisson statistics requires
introducing an additional parameter for each bin of each template histogram, as
well as the "physics" fraction parameters, but the minimisation with respect to
these additional parameters is done analytically rather than introducing them
as formal fit parameters. However, the TFractionFitter method is limited to
linear combinations of fixed component shapes, and cannot handle more general
fitting problems, in which some of the fitted parameters determine the shape of
the distribution, rather than just the normalisation.
The normalisations found are listed below:
1S = 0.2650 0007
2S = 0.5408 0006
3S = 0.1610 0005
The di-muon invariant mass with the normalisations found in the previous study
applied is shown in Fig. 6.14 (right plot). It is evident that the data/MC agreement
for invariant masses greater than 8.5 GeV gets better and closer to the unity, while
it is still off in the low invariant mass region. This is probably due to the fact
that the normalisation of MC predictions for QCD multijet background (bb, cc) is
not reliable (please refer to Sec. 6.3, where the data-driven normalisation of the
multijet background is found). Furthermore, it was studied if the normalisation
factors found in the previous study vary with the rapidity. For this purpose, four
pseudo-rapidity regions are defined:

As before, a TFractionFitter method is used to find the correct normalisations
and the results are shown in Fig. 6.15. The normalisations in the four pseudora-
pidity regions have been found to be similar among them; to be more precise,
they differ from each other by 2-3%. Moreover, they are also consistent with the
normalisation factors found in the study integrated in pseudorapidity, where the
difference is 2-3% as well.
6.2.6 Trigger SF validation
In this section, the validation of the trigger SFs computed for the analysis
triggers will be shown. These SFs have been calculated by other members of the
analysis team, so only the studies where I got involved will be reported in the
following.
The trigger SFs validation was performed in two separate steps. First of all, the
trigger SFs were tested as a function of the transverse momentum of the leading
muon of the selected pair. More precisely, we assessed their impact in four different
pT slices, namely:

tributions. All selection criteria are applied. The statistical uncertainties for the signal
and background distributions are combined in the shaded band in the ratio panel (lower

The outcome of this validation can be found in Fig. 6.18 for the 2mu6 triggers and
in Fig. 6.19 for the 2mu4 ones. A similar improvement in the data description as
compared to the one observed in the previous case can be seen. The disagreement
between data and MC shown in Fig. 6.16 - 6.19 can be explained by the wrong
normalisation of the LO Pythia bb/cc samples. The method to retrieve the data-
driven normalisation of the LO Pythia bb/cc samples will be described Sec. 6.3.7.
6.2.7 Data to MC comparisons
All the relevant kinematic distributions for data and Monte Carlo (MC) sim-
ulation after all selection criteria are applied are shown in Fig. 6.20 - Fig. 6.22.
The invariant mass distribution of the di-muon pair shows a good agreement in
the data/MC ratio across the whole spectrum, apart from in the lowest invariant
mass bin, where we expect to not have MC providing a good description of the
data, given the wrong normalisation of the DY signal MC sample (see Sec. 6.3.1
for further discussion). The inclusive ,  and the Z boson y distributions are in a
good agreement between data and MC. This agreement is also visible in the Z pT
and inclusive lepton pT distribution shown in Fig. 6.22, where the MC predictions
agrees with data within uncertainties. The method to retrieve the data-driven
normalisation of the LO Pythia bb/cc samples will be described Sec. 6.3.7 and the
factor shown in Tab. 6.5 have been applied to produce these plots.
6.2.8 The 7 to 9 GeV bin
The aim of this section is to show the control kinematic distributions in
the invariant mass bin between 7 and 9 GeV. In this specific bin, all the selec-
tion criteria are applied, apart from the trigger selection requirement. Indeed,
the di-muon pairs selected in this bin need to pass and to be matched to the
HLT_mu4_iloose_mu4_7invm9_noos trigger. In addition to the nominal se-

lection criteria, a cut on pZT > 8 GeV is imposed, to suppress the QCD multijet
background further. The normalisation factors found in the  CR (Sec. 6.2.5) are
applied to the  samples shown in Fig. 6.23. The Z pT reweighting previously
6.3 QCD background estimation
described in Sec. 6.2.4 is applied. The method to retrieve the data-driven normali-
sation of the LO Pythia bb/cc samples will be described Sec. 6.3.7 and the factor
shown in Tab. 6.5 have been applied to produce these plots.
It is clearly visible that a poor agreement between data and MC is achieved, proba-
bly due to the wrong normalisation of the MC DY sample (please refer to Sec. 6.3.1
for further discussion). The poor description of the data provided by the MC is
probably due to the breakdown of the theory predictions, given that the considered
phase space is very tiny and close to the cut imposed on the lepton pT . In addition
to that, this invariant mass range probes the very high-pT tail and it could be that
Powheg+Pythia does not reproduce kinematic distributions so well, taking into
account that the pT of the di-muon system is much more greater than the invariant
mass in this region. Furthermore, there is the possibility that further background
sources need to be included. For example, one could be the production of W + c,
with W and c decaying into  and + respectively. This specific process could
produce a high-pT muon and a soft one, and give an opposite charge excess at
large di-muon pT . Anyway, it should be significantly suppressed by the isolation
requirement and also it should not be appearing predominantly in the low mass
6.3 QCD background estimation
The largest background in the considered invariant mass range is expected to
be multijet + heavy flavour jets with leptonic decay of mesons. These mesons can
decay semi-leptonically, where one of the quarks decays via a charged current
weak decay to produce a charged lepton and a neutrino. This charged lepton
can be mis-identified as coming form the DY interaction. Only energetic charged
leptons produced from meson decays will be selected by the DY selection. The
requirement that the muons are isolated removes a large fraction of potential
multijet background events. However, multijet processes have large cross sections
and therefore still remain a large background, particularly for lower values of
di-muon invariant mass and muon pT .
Another source of background comes from decays of , K and hadrons mis-
identified as muons due to random coincidences between inner detector tracks
and hits in the muon spectrometer. This background is reduced greatly by isolation
requirements and using high-quality muon reconstruction working points. As this
is expected to be symmetric between + and  charges, it can be easily subtracted
by performing same-sign muons subtraction. On the contrary, the background
from heavy flavours decays is expected to have an excess in the opposite-sign
pairs, e.g. gg  bb +X,X . To extract this heavy flavour component, the
fact that muons from heavy flavours decays originate from the decay vertices
of the respective B hadrons and thus the two muons will not originate from a
common vertex, as for the DY pairs, can be exploited.
Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are thought to only perform moderately well at
simulating QCD background processes, and indeed are thought not to get the
normalisation right (even though the event shapes may be reasonable). For this
reason a template fit method has been developed to minimise the reliance on MC
6.3 QCD background estimation
predictions. The template fit provides a way of improving the QCD background es-
timation in Monte Carlo, by utilising supplementary information about the shape
of the distributions given by the non isolated Opposite-Sign (OS) data, subtracted
by Same-Sign (SS) data component.
In the following this fully data-driven method (we refer to this method as Super-
Fitter in the following) for the QCD background estimation is presented.
6.3.1 The SuperFitter method
An almost pure sample of QCD background events is selected in the data
by requiring the full event selection except the FixedCutTight isolation cut.
A not-isolated muon pair is made by two muons both failing one or more of the
following requirements:
 ptvarcone30/pt < 0.06;
 topoetcone20/pt < 0.06;
The variable in use for discriminating the QCD background is defined as follows:
2QCD =
d0(1)
d0(1)
d0(2)
d0(2)
z0(1, 2)
(z0(1, 2))
(6.2)
where the last term of the equation represents the significance of the z0 of the
pair, defined as follows:
significance z0 =
|z10  z
2 + (
. (6.3)
Then, assuming a gaussian resolution on d0 and z0, for two muons originating from
the same vertex, the distribution of 2QCD follows a 
2 distribution with 3 n.d.f. . Af-
terwards, the probability to be a signal-like (flat between 0 and 1) or background-
like (peaked around 0) event has been evaluated as Prob(2QCD,n.d.f. = 3) and it
has been used for estimating the QCD background. The distribution of this new
variable can be found in Fig. 6.24.
This new variable is preferred to the |d0 significance| of the muon pair,
|d10  d
)2 + (
, (6.4)
which is dominated by the muon with the worst resolution.
Calling iso the isolation efficiency and DY the number of signal events before any
isolation requirement, the number of DY events after the isolation selection on
two or zero muons (namely DYii and DYnn) can be defined as follows:
DYii  2iso DY
DYnn  (1 iso)2 DY

Fig. 6.24: Prob(2QCD,n.d.f. = 3) distributions for both data and sum of MC samples. All
selection criteria are applied. The statistical uncertainties for the signal and background
distributions are combined in the shaded band in the ratio panel (lower panel), and the
statistical uncertainties are shown on the data points (vertical bars). The method to retrieve
the data-driven normalisation of the LO Pythia bb/cc samples will be described Sec. 6.3.7
and the factor shown in Tab. 6.5 have been applied to produce this plot.
So, under the assumption that the background shape of the variable chosen is
independent from the isolation requirement, we can fit the distributions for the
following two different cases, namely isolated-isolated (ii) and not isolated-not isolated
(nn), with:
Nii = k DY jii + bii Bj + EW
Nnn = k DY jnn +Bj + EW jnn,
(6.6)
where j indicates a given bin of the Prob(2QCD,n.d.f. = 3) distribution, k is the
DY signal strength, bii is the coefficient to normalise the ii background, B is the
number of nn multijet background events and EW represents the sum of the
following backgrounds: tt, Z/  +,   + and   +. Nii and
Nnn represent the number of isolated-isolated and not isolated-not isolated events
respectively, while DYii and DYnn are the MC predictions for ii and nn DY events.
Then, the following 2 function can be defined for a given measurement bin in
(m, |y|):
ii N

n.d.f. = 2  (number data bins) number background bins 2 = N 2, (6.8)
with  representing the statistical uncertainty only and the N + 2 free parameters
in the fits corresponding to Bj , k and bii.
The result of the fit to the isolated-isolated and not isolated-not isolated distributions
for all the different invariant mass bins is shown in Fig. 6.25. The statistical un-
certainties are approximately 2% for 14 < m`` < 60 GeV,  4% for 12 < m`` < 14
GeV and it is between 11% and 16% in the first invariant mass bins (7 < m`` < 9
GeV). It is also visible that the normalisation of the MC DY samples is always
around the unity, but not in the lowest invariant mass bin, where is close to 2.
This could explain the disagreement between MC and data in the first bin of the
invariant mass distributions shown in Fig. 6.20, in the first plot of Fig. 6.13 or in
the kinematic distributions plotted in Fig. 6.23.
6.3.2 Comparison with the TFractionFitter method
In order to cross-check the DY sample normalisations found with the SuperFitter
method presented above, the following method has been used. The relative fraction
of bb+ cc and Drell-Yan (DY) MC required to describe the Prob(2QCD,n.d.f. = 3)
variable in data are defined by
Ndataii = f1 DYii + f2  (Ndatann N other MCsnn ), (6.9)
where f1 is the fraction of the isolated DY events and f2 is the fraction of the
not isolated data, after the subtraction of all the other not isolated MC samples,
including the DY sample, namely: Z/  +, tt,   + and   +
(an event is considered not isolated when both the muons in the pair do not satisfy
the isolation requirement). A likelihood fit using the TFractionFitter tool
within the ROOT framework is used to determine f1 and f2. f1 and f2 are defined
in each measurement bin in (m, |y|), being f1 the DY signal strength previously
defined as k in Eq. 6.6. To compute the goodness of this QCD background esti-
mate, a 2 function is defined comparing the data and MC distributions after this
procedure. Eq. 6.9 assumes that the normalisation of the DY MC in N other MCsnn is
correct. As this is not true, the fit has to be repeated recursively. The convergence
of the TFractionFitter method has been studied and it has been found that
this method needs four iterations to converge e.g the normalisation of the DY
MC sample does not change between the third and the fourth iteration within a
tolerance of 0.1%.
A comparison between the normalisation of the DY MC sample found with these
the two above-mentioned methods is shown in Fig. 6.26. As it is clearly visible

from Fig. 6.26, a nice agreement between the two methods has been observed. It
can be also seen that the uncertainty on the DY normalisations computed with the
TFractionFitter method are always larger than the ones estimated with the
SuperFitter method.
6.3.3 Closure test
As a closure test, the fit results with pseudo data have been checked or so-called
Asimov sample constructed from MC simulation:
Asimii(x) = k DYii(x) + bii  HFnn(x),
Asimnn(x) = k DYnn(x) + HFnn(x),
where DY is the MC DY signal, HF represents the bb+ cc MC background and the
indices ii and nn stand for isolated-isolated and not isolated-not isolated muon
pairs. The HF quantity for the isolated-isolated case is obtained by scaling the
HFnn quantity by arbitrary factors kii, given the assumption that the shape of
the multijet background is the same for isolated-isolated and not isolated-not
isolated events. Note that the error is not the actual MC error, but it is the error
associated to a data sample with the number of events expected by the MC, so:
(x) =
Asim(x). The results of this closure test are summarised in Fig. 6.27. As
expected, the normalisation of the DY MC sample is compatible with unity in
every (m``, y``) bin. This closure test proves that our fitting methodology does not
introduce any bias in the normalisation of the DY MC sample.
6.3.4 A new tailored isolation working point
The possibility to use tailored isolation working points with different cone
sizes has been considered: in particular, it has been investigated if a larger cone
size could have helped in discriminating the DY signal from the QCD multijet
background better. The following two choices have been explored:
 ptvarcone40/pT < 0.06 (iso WP1)
 ptvarcone40/pT < 0.06 and topoetcone30/pT < 0.06 (iso WP2)
The former contains a requirement on the track isolation (expected to be easier
for evaluating systematic uncertainties), while the latter requires both track and
calorimeter isolation. These two above-mentioned isolation working points have
been compared to the standard one provided by the IsolationSelectionTool11,
namely FixedCutTight (FCT) and FixedCutTightTrackOnly (FCTTO). The
former isolation working point is the one in use in the analysis event selection,
described in Sec. 6.2.
In order to understand which isolation working point would be the most suitable

one for this analysis, the following two variables have been studied: the DY signal
efficiency and the background rejection. They are defined as follows:
DY =
DYii +DYin +DYnn
1 QCD = 1
QCDii
QCDii +QCDin +QCDnn
where DY is the number of signal events, QCD represents the number of QCD
multijet events and the indices in all the events where one of the to muon of the
pair is isolated and the other is not. Fig. 6.28 shows these two quantities as a
function of the di-muon invariant mass for four different isolation WPs, namely
FCTTO, FCT, and the two tailored ones, iso WP1 and iso WP2. It can be seen
how the iso WP1 has a similar rejection power compared to FCT, but higher
efficiency. The stability of this results has been studied as a function of the rapidity
of the di-muon system for a given invariant mass bin and the outcome of this
study for the lowest invariant mass bin (from 7 to 9 GeV) is reported in Fig. 6.29.
The same conclusions as from Fig. 6.28 can be drawn: iso WP1 has a15% higher
signal efficiency and a slightly lower rejection power (3-5%) with respect to FCT.
Furthermore, the ratio between the efficiency on the DY signal and the square root
of the efficiency on the bb+ cc background has been evaluated:
(DY)
(bb+ cc)
(6.10)
and the outcome of this study is reported in Fig. 6.30, where it can be seen that
the iso WP1 is better than any other isolation WP in the most critical region for
background subtraction (m < 25 GeV) and it is comparable with FCT for higher
invariant masses. A concise summary of the efficiency for the four isolation work-
ing points considered in the lowest invariant mass bin can be found in Table 6.4.
For the two official isolation WPs (FCTTO and FCT), the statistical and systematic
errors due to isolation have been assessed. Furthermore, the sum in quadrature

of these error has been compared with the statistical error on the DY normalisa-
tion coming from the SuperFitter method and it has been found that the optimal
way to extract the DY normalisation is using FCT as default isolation WP, mainly
because it is the one better performing in rejecting the QCD multijet background
in the low mass region and it has smaller systematic uncertainties with respect
to FCTTO. This study has not been conducted for the other two isolation WPs
because systematic uncertainties were not available. It is visible from Fig. 6.30 and
Table 6.4 that iso WP1 has a higher signal efficiency and a comparable rejection

power with respect to FCT but it has not been used in the analysis because there
were not official recommendations for its usage.
Indeed, the inclusion of this more stringent and better performing isolation WP
in Rel20.7 has been requested but our proposal was not accepted because addi-
tional manpower was needed.
6.3.5 Cut on maximum 2QCD
The vertexing and the iloose isolation requirements at HLT level in our analy-
sis trigger has been studied using the following reference trigger: HLT_2mu6_10inv
m30_pt2_z10 (please refer to Sec. 6.4.2 for the description of this trigger and
further discussion). It has been found that the trigger efficiency decreases for
2QCD ' 15 and it is not well-modelled by MC. In order to avoid this region where
the data/MC agreement is poor because the trigger simulation is not perfect, a
possible cut on 2QCD has been considered.
Several cuts have been imposed and both their efficiency on the DY signal and
their rejection power of the QCD background have been evaluated. In the end, it
has been found that a cut 2QCD < 16 has a sufficiently large efficiency (larger than
98.5% for DY signal) and a rejection power of about 30%.
6.3.6 Improvements in the multijet background estimation
In order to maximize its discriminating power, different binning schemes for
the Prob(2QCD,n.d.f. = 3) variable have been studied. A finer binning for lower
values of Prob(2QCD,n.d.f. = 3) could help in discriminating the DY signal from
the QCD multijet background, while wider bins in the high-Prob(2QCD,n.d.f. = 3)
regime would avoid bins with few entries, which are difficult to be treated by the
SuperFitter method. Three different scenarios have been tested:
 100 fixed-width bins
 200 fixed-width bins
 bins with variable width
Fig. 6.31 shows the comparison between the various 2/n.d.f. obtained with the
above-mentioned methods, where it is visible that the 2/n.d.f. obtained with
Prob(2QCD,n.d.f. = 3), 
QCD < 16 and adopting bins with variable width are the
most stable and closest to unity.
6.3.7 The LO Pythia samples normalisation
Thanks to the SuperFitter method the number of QCD multijet events has
been found so it was possible to scale the LO Pythia prediction by a fraction
to exactly matched this number in each invariant mass and rapidity bins. The
outcome of this study is shown in Fig. 6.32. Then, the weighted average of these
scaling factor has been computed in each invariant mass bin and we applied the
following factors reported in Tab. 6.5. As expected, the relative uncertainty on the

fractions used to scale the LO Pythia predictions gets larger when increasing the
invariant mass and the rapidity. In the high-mass regime, the scaling factor applied
to the MC b b/cc sample is equal to 0, either because there are no events predicted
by the simulation or the SuperFitter prediction for the multijet background event is
null.

SFs presented in Fig. 6.32 and its error has been computed as the RMS in each bin.
6.4 Systematic uncertainties
The systematic uncertainty on the low-mass Drell-Yan cross section (DY )
comes mainly from the uncertainties on the trigger efficiencies and on the mul-
tijet background estimation. Other effects are due to inefficiencies for selecting
collisions with a reconstructed primary vertex, as well as the muon momentum
scale and resolution and the isolation efficiencies. The impact on the analysis is
evaluated by varying scale factors within their uncertainties. The uncertainties
are taken from the official tools provided by the performance groups. The total
systematic uncertainty on DY is then the sum in quadrature of the following
contributions (the ATLAS nomenclature is given in brackets):
 Muon momentum scale and resolution: Variations in the smearing of the
ID track (MUON_ID_STAT/SYS), variations in the smearing of the MS track
(MUON_MS_STAT/SYS), and variations in the scale of the momentum
(MUON_SCALE_STAT/SYS).
 Muon reconstruction efficiency: Statistical error on the scale factor (MUON_
EFF_STAT), and systematic error on the scale factor (MUON_EFF_SYS).
Other two systematics, due to measuring low-pT muons (MUON_EFF_STAT/
SYS_LOWPT) are added in quadrature.
 Isolation scale factor: Statistical error (MUON_ISO_STAT) and systematic
error on the scale factor (MUON_ISO_SYS).
6.4 Systematic uncertainties
 Sagitta correction: Corrections for charge dependent local effects due to
misalignments mainly in the Inner Detector and smaller local effects due
to local misalignments in the Muon Spectrometer (MUON_SAGITTA_RHO
and MUON_SAGITTA_RESBIAS).
 Pileup: The systematic uncertainty is defined as the difference between
reweighting to <  > with the nominal scale factor and scale factor varied
according to the tracking-CP group recommendations, corrected for changes
in the lepton identification and isolation efficiencies.
 d0 and z0 smearing: Variations in the smearing of the d0 (TRK_RES_D0_MEAS)
and z0 track (TRK_RES_Z0_MEAS).
 Luminosity: A constant systematic uncertainty of 2.1% related to the lumi-
nosity is considered, as described here12.
 Electroweak background: The normalisation of the DY  , tt,   
and   MC samples has been varied by 5% up and down with respect
to the nominal value.
In the above-describe list, the ATLAS label to identify the various systematics is
reported. The uncorrelated component of the systematic uncertainty is labelled as
STAT, while the correlated component is labelled as SYS.
The systematics uncertainties related to trigger efficiencies have not been assessed
using the standard MCP tool, but they have been computed by other members of
the analysis team, as reported in Sec. 6.4.1.
6.4.1 Trigger systematic uncertainties
The systematic uncertainties related to the trigger efficiency are computed
merging together the uncertainties related to the tag and probe method done with
muons from the Z boson decay and the uncertainties related to the tag and probe
method done with muons from the J/ decay.
They include a statistical component and two different source of systematics. The
first one (defined as TrigSyst1 in the following) adds in quadrature the following
contributions related to the background contamination of the samples:
 Z boson tag and probe:
 Cut on the |d0 significance| of the probe varied between 2 and 4 (nomi-
nal value: 3)
 Variation of the invariant mass cut, from 80 < m < 100 GeV to 83
< m < 97 GeV.
 J/ tag and probe:
 Variation of minimal R between tag and probe (0.240.02)

6.4 Systematic uncertainties
 Variation of sidebands from [2.7-2.9],[3.3-3.5] to [2.7-2.8],[3.4-2.5]
Furthermore, it includes a 3 per-mille uncertainty for the ID efficiency at the HLT-
level in the low-pT regime.
The latter one (defined as TrigSyst2 in the following) takes into account variations
of the azimuthal correlation between tag and probe: in the J/ region, it is done
through removing the reweighted  distribution of the probes, while throughout
imposing a cut | |< 0.1 between tag and probe in the Z region.
The effect of all these variations extremely small, less than 1%.
6.4.2 Vertexing and iloose requirement at HLT level
In order to evaluate the efficiency of the vertexing and the iloose isolation
requirements at HLT level in our analysis trigger, we considered the following
reference trigger: HLT_2mu6_10invm30_pt2_z10 (we refer to this trigger as
reference trigger in the following), which is characterized by the following re-
quirements:
 an invariant mass cut between 10 and 30 GeV
 the transverse momentum of the Z/ boson pT < 2 GeV
 z0(1, 2) < 10 mm
This study has been conducted selecting only the Lumi Blocks (LBs) in which
the analysis triggers were active. Furthermore, in order to avoid any possible
threshold effect, the 12 < m < 28 GeV range has been considered in order to
stay away from the mass cut applied at HLT level. The efficiency is calculated as
follows:
N(reference && LMDY)
N(reference)
(6.11)
where N(reference && LMDY) is the number of events passing both the reference
trigger and the analysis trigger and N(reference) represents the events passing
the reference trigger only.
Fig. 6.33 shows this efficiency as a function of Prob(2QCD,n.d.f. = 3) for both
data and MC. A difference of about 2.5% between data and MC is visible for
the region dominated by DY signal: Prob(2QCD,n.d.f. = 3) > 0.1. In order to
evaluate a systematic uncertainty related to this correction, it has been checked
this discrepancy between data and MC as a function of |y| for different invariant
mass bins and the results can be found in Table 6.6, where the last column displays
the SF computed as (SF(max) + SF(min))/2. Computing the RMS of the SFs it has
been found a correction factor of (2.1  0.3)% to be applied in every mass bin,
regardless of the considered rapidity bin.
6.4.3 Possible shape differences between isolated and not iso-
lated events

QCD background in the analysis signal region, another systematic to take into

account any possible difference in shape between isolated and not-isolated events
has been considered. This study is fully MC-based and the ratio between isolated
and not-isolated bb/cc MC events is fitted with the following function:
f(x) = p0  (1 + p1  exp(
2  p2
where x is the Prob(2QCD,n.d.f. = 3) variable. As a first step, a fit including all
the invariant mass and rapidity bins has been performed, in order to extract the
width of gaussian function (p2 in the previous expression.) The results of this fit is
presented in Fig. 6.34.
Then, fits in three different invariant mass regions, namely 7 to 14 GeV (with
the region from 9 to 12 GeV excluded), 14 to 28 GeV and 28 to 60 GeV have
been performed. In each invariant mass bin, two fits have been performed in two
different rapidity regions, more precisely: 0.0 < |y| < 0.8 (first rapidity region)
and 0.8 < |y| < 2.4 (second rapidity region). In these fits, the width of gaussian
function has been fixed to the value found in Fig. 6.34. The result of this study is
shown in Fig. 6.35. The up and down variations of the fitting functions are made
in an anti-correlated way, so if p1 was incremented by its associated error, p2 was

The impact of the up/down variations on the DY normalisation extracted with
the SuperFitter method has been assessed and Fig. 6.36 shows the results of this
study. The effect of these variations is tiny compared to the statistical uncertainty
on the DY normalisation. In the 12 < m < 17 GeV region the effect is quite big,
reaching the size of half the statistical uncertainty of the the DY normalisation.
Lastly, it is visible that the values found for high invariant masses and higher
rapidities may suffer from lack of statistics, as it is clearly visible also in Fig. 6.35.
As previously discussed in Sec. 6.2.8, the QCD background estimation does not
take into account the W + jets events. This contribution can be estimated by MC
simulations, but it is expected to be negligible in the considered invariant mass
range, as it has been found in the previous low-mass DY measurement performed
by ATLAS at 7 TeV [217].

6.5 Drell-Yan Cross Section
The cross section measurements are extracted using a bin-by-bin unfolding
technique due to high bin purity seen in both the one-dimensional (1D) and two-
dimensionals (2D) binning schemes. The justification for the unfolding techniques
used as well as the methodology for calculating the cross sections are described
in this section. The two analysis cross sections that are measured are calculated
using the following formulae:
L  CDY  m
(6.12)
dmd|y|
L  CDY  m  y
(6.13)
where N represents the number of data event, B is the estimated background,
L is the integrated luminosity of the data, CDY is an unfolding correction factor
(acceptance defined in Eq. 6.14) and m and y are the bin widths for the single
differential mass measurement and the double differential mass and rapidity
measurement respectively.
6.5.1 The Fiducial Volume
The cross sections measured in this analysis use the Born muon definition. The
Born level defines the unfolded truth particle as a particle that has not undergone
QED final state radiation (FSR). The following fiducial volume is used for the cross
section measurement:
 Muon pT > 4.5 GeV.
 Muon ||< 2.4.
 Invariant mass 7 < m < 9 GeV or 12 < m < 60 GeV (with the invariant
mass interval 9 < m < 12 excluded).
Moreover, a cut on the pZT > 8 GeV is applied in the 7 < m < 9 GeV bin.
The di-muon mass range of the fiducial volume is chosen to complement mea-
surements made of the DY cross section on the Z resonance [164] (66 < m < 116
GeV).
6.5.2 Invariant mass and rapidity resolution
The resolution of the di-muon rapidity is shown in Fig. 6.45, while the di-muon
mass resolution is shown in Fig. 6.46. The variables mgen and |ygen | are the Born
generator-level values and variables mreco and |yreco | are the reconstructed-level
quantities. The vertical bars shown in the plots represent the Root Mean Squared

6.5.3 Purity, Stability and Acceptance
In order to determine the cross section within the fiducial volume described in
Sec. 6.5.1, a correction factor, CDY , to take into account the differences between the
reconstruction and fiducial level selections needs to be calculated. This correction
accounts for any events that have migrated from their generated bins to other
analysis bins. In addition, because the detector does not have a perfect detector
efficiency some of the generated events will not be reconstructed at all and this
needs to be accounted for as part of the selection efficiency. The CDY factor is
determined from signal MC only.
The fraction of events generated in a bin to those reconstructed in a bin is given by
the acceptance, defined as follows:
CiDY =
N irec (reco selection only)
N igen (truth selection only)
(6.14)
where i represents the bin index, N irec and N
gen are the number of events recon-
structed and generated in a given bin i respectively. The level of bin migration in
the analysis can be assessed introducing the concepts of purity and stability. The
purity describes how many events in each reconstructed bin were generated in the
same bin:
Events generated and reconstructed in a bin i
Events reconstructed in a bin i
, (6.15)
while the fraction of events that have left the bin in which they were generated is
described by the stability:
Events generated and reconstructed in a bin i
Events generated in a bin i

Fig. 6.48: The purity (left) and stability (right) in the 2D binning scheme using DY MC

Fig. 6.47 and Fig. 6.48 show the purity and the stability in the analysis binning
schemes for the di-muon mass and di-muon rapidity respectively. From Eq. 6.15
and Eq. 6.16 it can be seen that the acceptance, defined in Eq. 6.14, can be computed
from the stability and purity CDY,i = Si/Pi. The purity in di-muon mass is over 80%
for the single-differential binning scheme. Purities higher than 90% are observed

resonance radiative tail. All these plots are made without taking into account
the prescale factor of 0.25 between the luminosities recorded by 2mu4 and 2mu6
triggers. The acceptances for both the one- and the two-dimensional distributions
are shown in Fig. 6.49. Acceptances of 95% or higher have been observed in the
single differential binning scheme, while the overall acceptance for the double
differential distribution is between 20% and 60%. The acceptances gets larger when
increasing the invariant mass and the rapidity.
6.5.4 Results
The measured fiducial double-differential cross sections
dmd|y|
is reported
in Fig. 6.50. These plots show the comparison between the lmDY cross-sections
and the NLO predictions from Powheg+Pythia, described in Sec. 6.1. In Fig. 6.50
the extracted lmDY cross-sections is also compared to additional theoretical pre-
dictions generated with Sherpa v2.2.1. A more detailed description of this
additional DY signal sample can be found in Ref. [2].
It can be seen that the measured cross-sections is broadly in agreement with the
NLO+LL predictions from Powheg+Pythia, while a disagreement both in the
normalisation and qualitatively in the shape of the cross section as a function of
|y| is visible when comparing the lmDY data to the Sherpa predictions.
It needs to be taken into account that the systematic uncertainties may be overesti-
mated, in particular the uncorrelated part between different rapidity bins. Indeed,

it will be possible to reduce the uncertainty on Isounc and 
unc considering the differ-
ent bin in the efficiency maps as uncorrelated.
The extracted lmDY cross-sections as a function of the invariant mass of the di-
muon pair, namely d/dm, is shown in Fig. 6.51. As already observed in Fig. 6.50,
the measured cross-sections is broad in agreement with the Powheg+Pythia pre-
diction, while a disagreement at 20%-30% level is visible when comparing the
lmDY data to the Sherpa predictions. This difference could be explained by the
fact that the low-mass DY cross section is extracted at Born level, but Sherpa does
not have this concept and the predictions are to bare level14.
As already discussed in Sec. 6.2.8 and as it can be seen from the plots shown in
Fig. 6.23, both Powheg+Pythia and Sherpa describe the measured cross section
(both single- and double-differential) poorly. This is probably due to the break-
down of the theory predictions, given that the considered phase space is very tiny
and close to the cut imposed on the lepton pT . In addition to that, this invariant
mass range probes the very high-pT tail and it could be that NLO MC predictions
do not reproduce kinematic distributions so well, taking into account that the pT
of the di-muon system is much more greater than the invariant mass in this region.
6.6 Summary of Chapter 6
The ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider has been used to measure the
double-differential cross section of Drell-Yan production in the low-mass regime,
namely between 7 and 60 GeV, with the range 9 < m < 12 GeV excluded. This
chapter presented the results of the measurement conducted with 3.2 fb1 of pp
collision data collected at
s = 13 TeV and recorded during 2015 data-taking
period. The observed distributions in the di-muon final state are consistent with
14Particle-level kinematics after final state radiation (FSR).

between the measured data and the theoretical predictions.
These data will be possibly included in a full QCD fit, in order to test the need
for ln(1/x) resummation in the low-x regime (as done in Ref. [142] for example).
However, this will possible only once theory exists for matrix element as well as
for splitting functions.

Conclusion
In this thesis, three analyses covering different aspects of the Drell-Yan process
have been presented. The search for a new heavy neutral gauge boson, a Z  boson,
decaying in di-lepton final state is the first analysis described in this thesis. In this
analysis, di-lepton events with invariant masses ranging up to 4 TeV were studied.
The data in use were collected by the ATLAS experiment in the year 2015+2016,
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb1. No significant deviation
from the Standard Model prediction is observed and several BSM theoretical
models have been benchmarked. Upper exclusion limits at 95% confidence level
are therefore set on the cross-section times branching ratio   B for a spin-1 Z 
Gauge boson decaying into di-leptons. The resulting lower mass limits are 4.5 TeV
for the Z SSM , 4.1 TeV for the Z
, and 3.8 TeV for the Z
, along with other E6 Z
models. Lower exclusion limits are also set on the energy scale  for various qq``
contact interaction models, ranging between 23.5 TeV and 40.1 TeV.
In the second analysis, the double-differential cross section measurement of the
process pp Z/  `+` at a center of mass energy of
s = 8 TeV is used in a
PDF fit to put constraints on the photon PDF of the proton. These data allow a
determination of x(x,Q2) with uncertainties at the 30% level for 0.02  x  0.1.
The resulting photon PDF is in agreement and exhibit smaller PDF uncertainties
that the only other existing photon PDF fit from LHC data, the NNPDF3.0QED
analysis, based on previous LHC Drell-Yan measurements. It is also in agreement
within uncertainties with two recent theoretical calculations of the photon PDF,
LUXqed and HKR16.
The last analysis presented in this thesis utilised
s = 13 TeV data, collected in 2015
(3.2 fb1), to measure the double-differential Drell-Yan cross section
dmd|y|
the di-muon final state. The extracted fiducial cross sections are in broad agreement
with predictions from Powheg interfaced with the Pythia v8.1 parton shower
program. The programs used the CT10 PDF and the AZNLO CTEQ6L1 tune for
Powheg+Pythia. These measurements can potentially be used to test the need
for ln(1/x) resummation once theory exists for matrix elements, as well as splitting
functions. In this regard, some preliminary studies have been already conducted
and they can be found in Ref. [200].
