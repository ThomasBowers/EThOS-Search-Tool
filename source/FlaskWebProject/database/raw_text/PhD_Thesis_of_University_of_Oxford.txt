First of all I would like to thank my supervisor Andrei Seryi. His in-
sights and ideas have driven the research in this thesis from the very first
day. Andreis encouragement and guidance created an extremely positive
working environment resulting in interesting group discussions and giving
me motivation and confidence in my work.
I would also like to thank Emmanuel Tsesmelis for taking over as my su-
pervisor when Andrei left, his feedback and support during the final stages
of my thesis was critical. Moreover, the first year accelerator courses that
he organises provided a strong foundation for the work during my PhD.
At this point I would like to acknowledge everyone involved in teaching
in these courses, especially Ted Wilson, who showed us how enjoyable
accelerator design can be.
I would like to thank all my colleagues in Oxford and the other JAI insti-
tutions who helped create a positive and familiar atmosphere within the
institute. Special thanks go, of course, to my group members and friends
Emila Cruz-Alaniz and Jose Abelleira who helped me a lot throughout
my studies and were great company along the way.
My thanks also go to the colleagues at CERN who have always been
welcoming and helpful when I was visiting. I would like to thank Roge-
lio Tomas who is very approachable and always has great input on my
work and ideas with whom I could co-operate. As well as Frank Zim-
mermann, for his keen interest and support in my work. My gratitude
also goes to Daniel Schulte and Antoine Chance as well as Roman Martin
and Andy Langner who were a great help on all FCC-hh related top-
ics. Moreover, I want to thank my friends and colleagues Michael Hofer,
Jacqueline Keintzel, Matthew Crouch and Demin Zhou  together we
created a great HE-LHC team. Finally, I want to thank the entire OMC
team for letting me join during various measurement session on the LHC
as well as teaching me how to extract the data.
I am eternally grateful for my mother who supported and motivated me in
everything I did, my father who was always there and I can count on and
my stepfather who has motivated me to follow an analytical path from a
young age. Without their love and support I would never be where I am
today.
Special thanks go to my partner Muna who supported me and was with
me on the PhD journey since the very first day. I want to thank my
brothers Aaron and David, who have been my best friends since I can
remember. Of course I have to also acknowledge my baby siblings Anouk
and Besarion who have been an inspiration to do well.
I also acknowledge all the friends I have made in Oxford and CERN during
my PhD outside of work. I am obliged to everyone who has played for
Keble College Darts Club during my time in Keble. I am grateful for all
the friends who shaped the MCR and made it a great place.
Finally I want to thank all my teachers, tutors and professors on my path
who have driven my interest to learn and research and guided my along
the way.
Abstract
In order to further probe our understanding of the structure of matter and
the universe, physicists constantly strive to create particle colliders that
reach higher energies and luminosities. Improved technologies can partly
help to fulfil these goals, however, novel experimental interaction region
(EIR) optics and methods are also essential to this cause.
This thesis covers several optics issues and solutions applicable to the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC), its High Energy (HE-LHC) upgrade as well
as the Future Circular Collider (FCC-hh). A key tool presented in this
thesis is an optimisation method to produce short final focus triplets that
produce large integrated gradients whilst having an aperture sufficiently
large to sustain the beams and radiation shielding.
The optimisation method uses a thin lens solution as a first approximation
for the required quadrupole strength. This solution is outlined in the
thesis, it has a large range of potential applications. This is demonstrated
by using it to optimise the dynamic aperture of the Nuclotron-based Ion
Collider fAcility (NICA), which is severely impacted by quadrupole fringe
field effects.
An optimised triplet for the FCC-hh is integrated into the EIR and the
resulting optics as well as the general impact it has on the machine is
presented in this thesis. It also presents how the LHC EIR can be modified
for the HE-LHC, including the implementation of an optimised triplet.
Dynamic aperture studies of the HE-LHC with triplet field errors were
also performed in the scope of this work.
Finally, a ballistic alignment optics for the LHC will be presented as well
as a method that uses singular value decomposition to measure the offset
of modulated quadrupoles. It will also be illustrated how this method can
be used to improve the accuracy to optics measurements. These efforts
can be used to improve the stability and luminosity of the LHC.

1.1 Single Particle Motion
1.1.1 Charged Particles in Fields
The underlying principle in all particle accelerators is the interaction of charged par-
ticles with electromagnetic fields. These fields can be used to accelerate but also steer
particles so that they can reach large kinetic energies, whilst being guided through the
machine. The force F a particle with charge q experiences when travelling through
an electric field E and magnetic field B at a velocity v is called the Lorentz force and
can be expressed as [1, p. 3]
F = q(v B + E). (1.1)
Since the magnetic component of the Lorentz force qv  B acts perpendicular to
the direction of travel it does not change the energy of the particle. Therefore, only
electric fields are used to accelerate particles to high energies. The energy, E, a
particle gains when travelling from one point r1 to another point r2 is equal to the
integral of the force along the trajectory [1]
F(r)  dr = q
E(r)  dr = qV, (1.2)
where V is the potential difference across the trajectory. Hence, the energy gain, in
electronvolt, for a particle with the elementary charge, e, is equal to the potential
difference across the field it travels through.
Since it is impossible to achieve a perfect vacuum, the highest obtainable electric
fields are limited by the dielectric strength of the vacuum. Even for the best vacuum
the highest static fields before breakdown are typically around 105 V m1 [2]. On the
other hand, particles in accelerators tend to have large kinetic energies and velocities
close to the speed of light, c = 3.0  108 m s1. Therefore, even for fields of around
1 T, the product |vB|  108  109 V m1, making the magnetic component much
larger than the electric component. Hence, even though magnetic fields cannot be
used to increase the energy of particles they are highly effective for steering particles
at high energies.
1.1.2 Natural Coordinates
In order to simplify the electrodynamics for accelerators, it is convention not to use
classical Cartesian coordinates but to define a co-moving system [3, p. 44-47]. In this
system the s axis is aligned with the trajectory an ideal particle would take through
the accelerator. The x and y axes are perpendicular to the s axis at every point and
lie in the horizontal and vertical planes respectively. A schematic of this system is
shown in Figure 1.1.
By using this coordinate system one can apply the chain rule to convert time
derivatives into spatial derivatives by realising that for any function f the time deriva-

point along the design trajectory represented by the dashed line.
tive f can be expressed as
= f v, (1.3)
where f  is the spatial derivative and v is the speed along the s axis. This system is
more natural as it describes the dynamics of the particles as a function of its position
in the accelerator rather than with respect to time.
In this coordinate system, and using the approximation v 
v, 0, 0
the Lorentz
force in a magnetic field can be expressed as
F = mr = mv2r = qv B = q
BsBx
 = qv
 0By
 , (1.4)
where m is the mass of the particle.
From this one can extract equations of motion in the x and y planes to be
x =
y =
(1.5)
respectively. In Equations 1.5, p is the longitudinal momentum mv and the quantity
B  p
is defined as the beam rigidity  a quantity describing the particle resistance
to the effect of a magnetic field [4, p. 24-26]. The rigidity depends on the particles
mass and charge but also the momentum it has been accelerated to.
In order to solve the dynamics analytically the equations are often linearised. The
first step in doing this is performing a Taylor expansion of the right hand side of
Equations 1.5. For the horizontal plane this would be
x =
By = 
By,0 +
+ ...
x3 + ...
(1.6)
An ideal particle has x = 0 and will therefore experience an acceleration equal to
By,0
Since for an ideal particle, the co-moving coordinates has to result in x remaining
zero, it has to result in a centrifugal force countering this effect. The centrifugal force
is given as F = mv
, where R is the radius of curvature  this results in x = 1
Therefore, in Equation 1.6, the convention
By,0
is used. The other component,
k, m and o are the normalised quadrupole, sextupole and octupole components of the
magnetic field [3, p. 44-46]. Often this equation is truncated at the linear quadrupole
term to simplify the equations, however higher order terms are found in accelerators
and have to be dealt with separately.
1.2 Elements in Synchrotrons
In this section the different electromagnetic components that can be found in an ac-
celerator will be described. First, it will take a closer look at dipoles and quadrupoles
and show how the dynamics can be linearised by only considering these components.
It will then outline the boundary conditions found in a synchrotron and how these
affect the dynamics. Next it will describe the effect of higher order static magnetic
elements before briefly describing radio frequency cavities.
1.2.1 Dipoles
A dipole magnet produces a field that is uniform and constant throughout its aperture.
This field is formed using two magnetic poles and causes all particles to be deflected
in the same direction. This property makes it convenient to use dipoles to steer the
trajectory of the entire beam and to define the geometry of the co-moving coordinates
around them. Whilst a particle that has the correct longitudinal momentum and lies
on the ideal trajectory will remain on this trajectory as it passes through a dipole,
the dynamics are more complex if the particle is not on the ideal trajectory.
In an ideal dipole, only the 1
dipole component of Equation 1.6 governs the
dynamics of the beam and is cancelled by the centrifugal force which is also equal
. A small deviation from the ideal orbit by x causes a change in the bending
radius causing this component to be 1
, this can be linearised by using a binomial
expansion and then truncating the results as followed
x =
R + x
1 + x
. (1.7)
This effect is often referred to as weak focusing as it produces a force in the opposite
direction of the offset, however, this effect is a lot weaker than the focusing effect from
quadrupoles. Another effect one has to consider are chromatic effects when a particle
has a small offset in longitudinal momentum, p. In this case the q
By has to be
corrected to
By, a similar linearisation as in Equation 1.7 can be performed
to come up with a full equation of motion for this system. The full equation of motion
also requires to subtract the centrifugal 1
resulting in
x = 
. (1.8)
In principle this could be repeated in the vertical plane, however, dipoles are almost
always used to steer beams in the horizontal plane for example in synchrotron arcs
or to manipulate the inter-beam separation. One exception to this are dipole kickers
that can be used to correct orbit distortions caused by imperfections or to induce
offsets from reference orbit.
1.2.2 Quadrupoles
Quadrupoles are magnets that are constructed by using four equidistant alternating
magnetic poles and produce a field in which the strength varies linearly with the
distance from the centre. The exact nature of this field depends on the orientation
of the quadrupole but the most common configuration produces a magnetic field
described by 
BsBx
 0Gy
 , (1.9)
where G is the constant gradient of the field. A useful property of this field is that
the resulting forces in the horizontal and vertical planes depend on the displacement
in the respective planes  thereby resulting in a focusing force whilst keeping the
equations of motion uncoupled.
The value of the gradient G depends on the strength of the field that can be
achieved at the poles as well as the distance between the poles. The simplest approx-
imation for this is that
, (1.10)
where BMAX is the highest achievable field with the magnet technology available and
r is the radius of the aperture of the magnet. The normalised quadrupole strength k
relates to the gradient as k = G
. As one can see from Equation 1.9, the strengths in
both planes are intrinsically linked such that kx = ky  k. Therefore, when adding
this term to the equations of motion in both planes one gets
x +
y + ky = 0.
(1.11)
If k is negative it has a focusing effect in the horizontal plane because it results in a
force that is in the opposite direction of the offset, at the same time this has a de-
focusing effect in the vertical plane. This is reversed when k is positive. Therefore,
quadrupoles of alternating gradient are commonly used to manipulate the beam in
both planes.
1.2.3 Solution to Linear Equations
From Equations 1.11 one can see that in an ideal lattice made of perfect quadrupoles
and dipoles would be sufficient for controlling the beams. It provides a means of guid-
ing the beam using dipoles but also focusing it using a combination of quadrupole
magnets. Moreover, these linear equations can be solved analytically, making it sim-
pler to design a lattice using these magnets.
For an on momentum particle Equations 1.11 can be summarised as
z +Kz = 0, (1.12)
where z can be x or y and K =
in the horizontal and K = k in the vertical
plane. Oscillatory equations of motion in this form are commonly found in physics
and it is referred to as the Hill differential equation. The solution to the Hill equation
is well studied and takes the form [5]
z(s) =
jzz(s) cos [z(s) z,0] ,
z(s) = 
z(s)
(sin [z(s) z,0] + z(s) cos [z(s) z,0]) ,
(1.13)
z(s) =
z(s)
(1.14)
. (1.15)
One can interpret this solution as a sinusoidal oscillation around z = 0 with an
envelope
jzz(s). z, z and z are known as the Twiss functions and depend
solely on magnets in the machine whilst jz and z,0 encapsulate the initial conditions
of the particle. The envelope of the oscillations depends on machine properties and
initial conditions, whilst the frequency of the oscillations varies as a property of the
machine.
Substituting this solution into the original equation of motion yields a differential
equation for z
2z +K
z = z
z  
z +K
z = 1. (1.16)
The solutions to this differential equation depends only on machine parameters and
not on the initial conditions of the particle. If one knows the z function and its
derivatives at a given point one can use these to compute the functions at a point
downstream.
The initial conditions,z0 and z
0, of the particle can be be used to solve for jz
and z,0, which leads to a system in which matrices of the position and momentum
downstream are described through a transformation acting on a vector containing the
initial conditions of the particle. The general expression is
z(s)
C(s) S(s)
C (s) S (s)
, (1.17)
where the S(s) =
z(s)
(cosz(s)+z,0 sinz(s)) and C(s) =
z(s)z,0 sinz(s) [6,
p. 28-30]. A common transfer matrix is that of a field free drift, in this case C(s) = 1
and S(s) = s. For a drift of length l this leads to a matrix
MDrift =
. (1.18)
Two other common matrices are those of a focusing (K > 0) and defocusing (K < 0)
segments of length l, these matrices are
|K|l) 1
|K|l)
|K| sin(
|K|l) cos(
|K|l)
cosh(
|K|l) 1
sinh(
|K|l)
|K| sinh(
|K|l) cosh(
|K|l)
(1.19)
respectively [4, p. 38-40]. In the limit of l  0, these matrices converge to the thin
lens approximation yielding
Mthin,F =
Kl 1
,Mthin,D =
. (1.20)
The properties of an accelerator can be computed by multiplying a series of matrices
representing the individual components to obtain the overall transfer matrix of the
machine. The particle dynamics can then be calculated from the initial conditions
of the particles. In addition to using this to design an accelerator, one can also
use these transfer matrices to measure the properties of a machine. To do this the
beam can be excited using a controlled dipole kick and the oscillations downstream
can be measured to compute the transfer matrix and compare it to the design for
corrections [7].
The solutions outlined above are for the homogeneous equation that sets p = 0.
For the full solution, the particular solution yielding 1
has to be found. This is
commonly done by finding the particular solution D(s), which is often referred to as
the dispersion function, for the case where p
= 1 so that a general solution can be
expressed as D(s)p
. The differential form of this solution is [6, p. 37-38]
D 
(1.21)
and the solution to this is
D(s) = S(s)
C(s)
R(s)
ds  C(s)
S(s)
R(s)
ds. (1.22)
This can be calculated along the accelerator and added to Equation 1.13 to obtain
the full solution
z(s) = z0(s) +D(s)
jzz(s) cos [z(s) z,0] +D(s)
z(s) = z0(s) +D
z(s)
(sin [z(s) z,0] + z(s) cos [z(s) z,0]) +D(s)
(1.23)
where z0(s) and z
0(s) are the position and transverse momentum of an on momentum
particle and D(s)  dD(s)
1.2.4 Closed Orbit
The linear equations in section 1.2.3 are dependant on the initial conditions and out-
line how the different elements affect the motion. The initial conditions depend on the
source and are not easy to define or measure. A special case arises in a synchrotron,
which is an accelerator that is designed to close on itself. In a synchrotron, the beam
reaches an equilibrium state in which it follows an orbit that might not be the same
as the design orbit but closes on itself. This orbit is referred to as the closed orbit [4,
p. 2]. The closed orbit zco at any point is defined as
, (1.24)
where M is the transfer matrix over one revolution.
In this case the periodicity z(s + C) = z(s) and z(s + C) = z(s), where
C is the circumference of the synchrotron, becomes the initial condition required
for the solution of the differential equations. This is often solved numerically by
defining all the elements in an accelerator and solving the dynamics through iterative
calculations [8, p. 127-137]. Once this is solved, one can evaluate the Twiss functions
at any point of the lattice and one can also define the transfer matrix, M, for one
revolution at any point of the lattice as [9, p. 18]
cos (2Qz) + z sin (2Qz) z sin (2Qz)
 sin (2Qz) cos (2Qz) z sin (2Qz)
. (1.25)
An important parameter used in this expression is the phase advance, z, over one
revolution in units of 2  this phase advance is referred to as the tune, Qz, of the
machine and is defined as [10, p. 318-319]
z(C)
 s0+C
z(s)
. (1.26)
Whilst the tune describes how many betatron oscillation a particle undergoes when
travelling around the ring once, we are often more interested in the non-integer part
of the tune as this describes how the particles location in phase space changes every
time it travels through the accelerator.
The closed orbit is also important when considering the effect of small linear
perturbations, such as dipole kicks or changed quadrupole fields, on the orbit and
tune of the machine. These effects can be unwanted or purposely induced in order to
obtain information about the lattice. One such effect is the so called k-modulation
of a quadrupole  in this process the current through a quadrupole is modulated to
result in a change of k by k.
The effect this has on the lattice can be approximated using the thin lens matrix
from Equation 1.20 with K = k and multiplying it by M. The new transfer
matrix, Mnew, will be of the same form of M but with Qz  Qz + Qz. Since
Mnew) = MMthin, one can equate the traces Tr(Mnew) = Tr(MMthin) to yield [9,
p. 19]
2 cos(2(Qz + Qz)) = 2 cos(2Qz) z(kl) sin(2Qz), (1.27)
where l is the length of the quadrupole and  is + in the x plane and  in the y
plane. This can be rearranged to form an expression for z in terms of k and Q,
which can be easily measured,
z = 
(cot(2Qz)[1 cos(2Qz)] + sin(2Qz))  4
. (1.28)
This method is useful to get very precise measurements of the average  functions
within a quadrupole. The modulation of the quadrupole also has an effect on the
location of the closed orbit if the quadrupole is misaligned by an amount zq or the
beam does not pass through the centre due an orbit error or bump of zq. To analyse
this case one can define M as the transfer matrix from the exit of the quadrupole to
the entrance of the quadrupole
M = M1quadM, (1.29)
where the quadrupole again has been approximated as a thin lens with a transfer
matrix Mquad. The misalignment of the quadrupole causes a kick equal to klzq for
z = x and z = y respectively. Therefore, Equation 1.24 can be expressed as [11]
zco  klzq
. (1.30)
Next one can perturb the system by increasing k  k+ k and labelling the change
in closed orbit as zco and z
co. to get
zco klzq  (k + )lzco
zco
. (1.31)
By substituting in Equation 1.25 one can show that at the exit of the quadrupole
zco = zq
z cot(Qz)kl
2 + z cot(Qz)kl
zco = zq
[1 z cot(Qz)] kl
2 + z cot(Qz)kl
(1.32)
1.2.5 Higher Order Effects and Corrections
In reality, momentum offsets, field errors and misalignments can cause non-linear
effects that have to be dealt with. The first such effect arises from quadrupole fields
that are not orientated in the same way as assumed in Equation 1.9  this might
arise from misalignments or errors in the magnetic fields. In this case an offset in
the horizontal plane causes a kick in the vertical plane and vice versa. This causes
complications because the equations of motion for both planes become coupled.
This coupling can be linearised which leads to coupling matrices that describe
how the motion in one plane affects that in the other, in an analogous way to the
single plane transfer matrices. In practice this coupling can be measured and then
corrected for using special skew quadrupoles that have been rotated by 45 around
the s axis and counter the unwanted coupling.
Another effect left out in the linearisation in Equation 1.11 is the effect quadrupole
fields have on off-momentum particles. A similar binomial expansion as used in Sec-
tion 1.2.1 can be performed to obtain a kp
z term. This term essentially indicates
that particles with a higher momentum experience a lower (de-)focusing effect than
particles with a lower momentum.
The fact that particles at different energies experience different focusing effects
means that the synchrotron tune of a single particle depends on its energy. The
chromaticity of a machine, Qz, is the measure of how much the tune varies with
energy. It is defined as Qz 
(p/p)
and it can be shown to be [10, p. 323]
Qz 
(p/p)
k(s)z(s)ds. (1.33)
This chromatic effect is often cancelled using sextupole magnets that produce a
Lorentz force kick of the form m
z2. One can substitute the orbit of an off-momentum
particle given in Equation 1.23 into this expression to get
z =
z0 +D
z20 +m
. (1.34)
In this expression the second term results in a quadrupole like term with a strength
, this strength is proportional to the chromatic term and can be used to
cancel this. This gives rise to second order terms in z and p, however, these can
be cancelled by using combinations of differently powered sextupoles and optics that
cancel these effects [3, p. 120-123].
Therefore sextupole families are used to reduce the chromaticity of the machine
and make sure the particles have a low tune spread. It can be shown that with
sextupoles the chromaticity is [10, p. 324]
Qz = 
(k(s) +m(s)D(s))z(s)ds, (1.35)
this can be used to find the sextupole strengths required to bring the chromaticity
to the desired value. For stability reasons this is often chosen to be a small positive
value.
Another way to quantify the chromatic effects of a machine is with the chromatic
amplitude function, W . This function is often referred to as Montague function
and quantifies the local distortion of the Twiss functions due to momentum due to
momentum offsets. The Montague function is defined as [12]
. (1.36)
It is often not possible to produce magnets that have pure multipole fields, instead
it is common to have a spectrum of unwanted multipole errors in a realistic magnet.
These field errors arise from systematic limitations from the design and the finite
length of the magnets but can also be a result in uncertainties and errors in the
manufacturing. If not compensated, these errors can distort the orbit and severely
affect the stability of the beam.
When including these non-linear terms in the equation of motion, it can be shown
that they result in orbit distorting terms, c(bn; p, q, l,m), on top of the linear solutions
outlined in section 1.2.3. It can be shown that these terms are [13]
c(bn; p, q, l,m) 
dsKn1(s)
i[(p2l)x(qm)y ], (1.37)
where Kn1 is the normalised multipole strengths as defined in Equation 1.6 corre-
sponding to a 2-n polar field. q, p, l and m are non-negative integers where q  2N,
p + q = n, 0  2l  p and 0  2m  q. A similar expression exists for resonances
due to skew fields  in this case bn is replaced with an, Kn1 is replaced with the cor-
responding normalised skew fields K
n1 and q  2N  1. If the unwanted multipole
fields in a machine are measured their effects can be cancelled out by using multipole
correctors at a specific phase and strength to minimise these orbit distorting terms.
It should also be noted that when considering the effect of an error in a single
location over multiple turns z is replaced by 2Qz. Since the 2Qz is multiplied
by integers in the exponent we can see by inspection that the term grows if the
non-integer part of the tune is a simple fraction. Therefore, it is common to run a
synchrotron at a non-integer that is far away from simple fractions.
1.2.6 Radio Frequency Cavities
All of the components explored so far produce static magnetic fields in order to guide
particles along a fixed path. However, sometimes one requires fields that vary with
time. On the one hand this may allow one to achieve higher peak fields without
breakdown but on the other hand it also creates fields that have a different effect
on particles at different locations in the bunch, thereby controlling the longitudinal
shape of the bunches and not just the transverse shape. These fields that vary in
time are often achieved in the form of standing waves produced by exciting different
harmonics in radio frequency (RF) cavities.
The most common type of RF cavity used in accelerators is an accelerating cav-
ity. It produces large electric fields in the longitudinal direction that accelerates the
particles in the beam as described in Equation 1.2. The standing wave produces a
voltage across the cavity that varies in time as V (t) = Vmax sin(2ft), where Vmax is
the peak voltage and f is the frequency at which the electric field varies.
One would achieve the largest acceleration if all the particles pass through the
cavity when V (t) = Vmax, however, for stability reasons it is desirable to design the
machine so that the individual bunches pass through an accelerating cavity slightly
earlier or later than this [4, p. 57-62]. At lower momenta the ideal time the particles
should pass through the cavity is slightly earlier and is illustrated by point A in
Figure 1.2.
The benefit of this is that if a particle has slightly less than average energy it
will be moving slightly slower. As a result of this the particle will reach the cavity
0 0.5 1
Time / Period

different phases in which bunches may pass through an accelerating cavity. Point D
shows the ideal time to pass through a crab cavity.
slightly later, illustrated by point B in Figure 1.2. Therefore the particle with lower
energy will experience a larger acceleration and catch up with the centre of the bunch,
whilst particles with higher energies will experience a smaller acceleration. This effect
provides buckets of stability, which cause particles to be in longitudinal bunches.
This effect breaks down when the velocity of the particles approaches the relativis-
tic limit and the difference in speed is negligible. In this case the dispersion function
causes particles with higher momenta to take a longer path resulting in them arriving
later - the energy at which this starts happening is known as the transition energy.
This is solved by changing the phase of the voltage in the cavities once this energy
is reached so that the bunch passes through the cavity as the gradient of the voltage
slopes down, this is represented in point C in Figure 1.2. This transition ensures that
the bunches remain in longitudinally stable buckets.
Another, less common, type of cavity is the crab cavity  this cavity induces
an electromagnetic kick in the transverse plane. It is phased in a way such that
particles in the centre of the bunch do not experience a kick, this is represented by
point D in Figure 1.2. Particles either end of the centre experience kicks in opposite
directions proportional to their distance from the centre. This cavity causes the bunch
to essentially experience a kick turning it around its longitudinal centre, the purpose
of this will be explained in section 1.4.
1.3 Synchrotron Conventions
1.3.1 Common Optics Structures
As discussed above, synchrotrons are designed to guide the beam on a trajectory
that closes on itself; this is done using a series of dipole magnets often arranged in
several arcs. In order to keep the beam focused, alternating gradient quadrupoles
are added in these arcs. The most common way of of doing this is through equally
spaced quadrupoles with opposite and equal strengths. These periodically repeating
structures are referred to as FODO cells [14].
The FODO cell gets its name from the fact that it consists of a focusing (F) and
de-focusing (D) quadrupole with drifts (O) filled with dipoles in between. The 
functions in a FODO cell are anti-symmetric in the two planes and are often matched
to produce a fixed phase advance, . The fraction of a FODO cell occupied by
dipoles is known as the fill factor. A larger fill factor means that a smaller dipole field
is required to bend the beam by the required amount.
Apart from arcs, synchrotrons also have straight sections that can be used to house
insertion regions (IRs) that fulfil different purposes such as injection and extraction,
collimation or acceleration. In colliders there are also IRs dedicated for the collisions,
such an IR is known as an Experimental Interaction Region (EIR).
1.3.2 Beam Emittance and Size
Section 1.2.3 outlines the motion of a single particle where the exact position and
momentum depend on the particle properties z,0 and jz. In a real bunch the in-
dividual particles have different initial conditions resulting in a distribution of z,0
and jz. One way of characterising this distribution is by measuring the root mean
square (RMS) size of the beam < z2 >. By calculating this for the expression of z in
Equation 1.13 whilst assuming z,0 is distributed uniformly one can show that [15]
< z2 >=
< jz >
z = zz, (1.38)
where we have defined <jz>
 z. It can also be shown that < z2 >= zz, where
z  (1 + 2z)/z.
Since the average position and momentum of the particles in the beam are zero
these averages correspond to the variance and it is therefore common to approximate
the beam size and divergence as the standard deviations z and z respectively where
z(s) =
zz(s), z(s) =
zz(s). (1.39)
The emittance can be measured using various methods [16] and the Twiss functions
are well defined by the magnets in a lattice so that the beam in an accelerator can
be well described using these equations.
The emittance decreases if the energy of the particles increases, therefore, the
normalised emittance,  = relrel, where rel = v/c and rel = (1  2rel)
1 is often
used, this is conserved during acceleration [4, p. 45-49].
1.3.3 Beam Stay Clear
Another important property of an accelerator is the beam stay clear (BSC), defined
as the distance from the centre of the beam to the wall of the vacuum chamber. It is
usually measured in units of beam size and in one dimension can be expressed as [17]
Lz  tz  kDz pp
, (1.40)
where Lz is the half width of the vacuum chamber and tz is the alignment tolerance
that is subtracted to give a safety margin. Another safety margin is provided by
the -beating factor k which summarises the uncertainty in the  function. This
uncertainty 
is called -beating as it propagates throughout the whole machine;
based on this k 
1 + / since z is proportional to
In practice the vacuum chambers can have complex shapes and the BSC is not
just evaluated in the x and y planes but at several angles. This is usually done by
software that evaluates the  functions at many points along a magnet and then
computes the BSC at several angles. These programs often also take into account
other factors like the beam halo or offsets of individual elements [8, p. 153-164]. The
minimum required BSC throughout the accelerator is known as the acceptance and
is usually limited by the collimator setting and how much beam intensity one is able
to afford to lose by tightening the collimators.
1.3.4 Dynamic Aperture
Another factor that limits the beam size is the dynamic aperture (DA). This is a
measure of the range of particles, again usual in units of beam size, that can circulate
the synchrotron without getting lost due to dynamic effects and non-linear imperfec-
tions. In an ideal linear machine the dynamic aperture would be infinite because all
particles follow well defined paths. Once you add errors, however, these orbits can
become unstable  since these dynamic effects are proportional to zn particles with
larger amplitudes, jz, are more likely to be on these unstable orbits.
The DA is evaluated by tracking particles at different amplitudes travelling around
the synchrotron up to ten million times and observing which particles remain on a
stable orbit [18]. The tracking is done with simulated non-linear errors and using
numerical integrators that are often symplectic, meaning that they do not truncate
the equations of motion, an example for such a tracker is Sixtrack [19, 20].
In order to speed up the computation by orders of magnitude, several other meth-
ods have been developed that aim to predict stability using many orders of magnitude
less turns. One method of how this can be done is by evaluating the Lyapunov ex-
ponent, L(z0), for particles with different initial conditions z0. This method tracks
two particles close to the point in phase space that is being sampled and evaluates
the distance between them d(z0, t) at every turn, t. The Lyapunov exponent is then
defined as [21, p. 60-64]
L(z0, t) =
 d(z0, t)d(z0, 0)
. (1.41)
For a stable region in the limit of t  , L(z0, t) should go to zero, therefore, the
change in L(z0, t) over many turns can be monitored and if it approaches zero it can
be considered a stable point.
In order to further increase the computational efficiency, Sixtrack uses two vari-
ants of this method, namely the distance and the slope method [22]. Both methods
also use data from tracking two initially close test particles, the distance method con-
siders a position in phase space to be stable if the distance between the test particles
does not exceed a certain threshold. The slope method measures the rate of change
of separation on a log-log scale and assumes chaotic motion if this exceeds a cer-
tain threshold. The distance method is considered to be optimistic, whilst the slope
method can be pessimistic, therefore, the commonly used dedicated post processing
programme SixDesk calculates a phase space average of the two methods [23].

This thesis focuses on the design, optimisation and measurement of the EIRs in
various hadron synchrotrons. This section will outline the typical layout of such an
EIR and give a brief overview of the different sections. A quick overview of a typical
half of an EIR used in this thesis is shown in Figure 1.3.
1.4.1 Interaction Point
The interaction point (IP), shown as point A in Figure 1.3, is the location at which
the two rotating beams collide and the interactions happen. The rate, Nr, at which
these interactions happen depends on the cross section, , of the interactions and the
collider luminosity, L, so thatNr = L. The cross-section is a quantity that represents
the effective transverse area two particles must lie in in order to interact, it depends on
all of the underlying physical interactions [24, p. 23-27]. The luminosity is a measure
of the probability of particles interacting per unit time, for identical infinitely short
beams it is expressed as [3, p. 25-27]
4yx
, (1.42)
where f and N are the frequency of bunches colliding and number of particles per
bunch respectively. It is common to measure the cross section, , in cm2 and L in
cm2s1. Often the average luminosity of a machine integrated over a time period
is a useful quantity to know, this is known as the integrated luminosity, commonly
measured in fb1 (1039cm2).
In order to prevent secondary collisions beyond the IP, the bunches are collided
at an angle as shown in Figure 1.4. This angle is known as the crossing angle, , and
is often measured in units of z where z is the plane in which the crossing angle lies.
As one can see in Figure 1.4 a) the crossing angle means that the bunches do not

fully overlap at the IP, thus reducing the luminosity. The luminosity with crossing
angle has to be corrected to L = RLL0 with [25]
, (1.43)
where s is the longitudinal beam size.
In order to counter this geometric reduction the crab cavities outlined in Sec-
tion 1.2.6 can be used to rotate the beams around an axis perpendicular to the
crossing plane to regain the full overlap as shown in Figure 1.4 b). This twist can be
achieved with a global crabbing scheme using a single cavity causing the bunches to
rotate around themselves as they travel around the accelerator. However, it is more
common to use a local scheme that kicks the beam just before it reaches the IP and
then kicks it just after in order to restore its original orientation. The equivalent crab
cavity voltage, Vc, required either side of the IP to fully recover the luminosity is [26]
2cEb tan
2fM12(cc IP )
sin (Qz)
sin (z[cc IP ]Qz)
, (1.44)
where c is the speed of light, Eb is the beam energy and M12(cc IP ) and z[cc
IP ] are the (1,2) transfer matrix element and phase advance in the crossing plane
from the crab cavities to the IP.
1.4.2 Triplet
From Equation 1.42 one can see that the luminosity is inversely proportional to the
beam sizes z =
zz. Therefore, it is desirable to have the  functions at the IP to
be as small as possible, this is usually achieved using strong focusing quadrupoles that
are often arranged in a triplet, B in Figure 1.3. The  function at the IP is labelled 
and it is common to design the accelerator so that the optics are symmetric around
the IP so that  = 0. The length of the drift between the IP and the start of the
triplet is known as L, using this it can be shown that the  at the entrance of the
triplet is [27]
 =  +
. (1.45)
From Equation 1.45 one can see that a small  results in very large  functions
in the triplet. This puts strong constraints on the minimum aperture of the triplet
magnets, this is worsened by the fact that the beams are on the same reference orbit
at that point, meaning that they pass through the same magnet aperture. From
Equation 1.10 we can see that the larger the aperture, the weaker the gradient meaning
that long quadrupole magnets are needed in order to get a large focusing effect.
Since the  functions and strengths in the triplet are very large it is one of the
biggest sources of chromaticity and non-linear resonance driving terms meaning it is
favourable to have shorter triplets with smaller  functions.
In this thesis the common convention of numbering the quadrupoles starting from
the closest to the IP will be adopted. The innermost quadrupole is labelled Q1, the
next one Q2 and so on. Sometimes quadrupoles are split for practical reasons, in this
case the sub-magnets are labelled alphabetically  i.e. Q1a, Q1b etc.
Final focus triplets are often used in hadron colliders with round beams, since
they help to reduce the  functions equally in both planes. However, in electron-
positron colliders, where the beams are usually flat due to radiation damping, it
is more common to use a quadrupole doublet. The innermost quadrupole usually
focuses in the vertical plane and the second quadrupole in the horizontal [28].
1.4.3 Separation Dipoles
In the arcs and most of the synchrotron, the two beams follow different reference
orbits and often also move through separate magnet apertures. However, in order to
collide they have to be put on the same reference orbit  this is usually done using a
pair of separation dipoles, shown in section C in Figure 1.3. As seen from the IP the
inner dipole, D1, separates both beams using a magnet with a single large aperture.
The second dipole, D2, steers the particles back onto parallel orbits.
Unlike the arc dipoles, the separation dipoles steer the beams in opposite direc-
tions, therefore if the beams circulate in different apertures there will be a large
magnetic flux through the separation between the two apertures in D2. This po-
tentially limits the aperture size of D2; the aperture in D1 is usually limited by the
mechanical stress the dipole can tolerate. The integrated dipole field required to sep-
arate the beams depends on the beams separation in the arc as well as the distance
between D1 and D2.
1.4.4 Matching Section
The triplet focuses the large  functions down again, however, these optics then
have to be matched to be compatible with the arc. This is achieved with a set of
individually powered quadrupoles in the matching section, D in Figure 1.3. The
strengths of these quadrupoles can be matched using special algorithms that are
often built into simulation software like MADX [8, p. 138-151]. These algorithms use
numerical methods to vary the strengths of the quadrupoles systematically in order
to get the desired Twiss functions at the exit. This process is called matching.
1.4.5 Dispersion Suppressor
The quadrupoles in the matching section would provide enough free parameters to
match the  and  functions in both planes. In addition to that, it is also good to
have no dispersion in the IP in order to keep the beam size as small as possible. The
arc FODO cells have some intrinsic dispersion, hence, a group of quadrupoles and
dipoles known as the dispersion suppressor (DS) are installed. One half of the DS is
installed either side of the IP at the interface between the arc and EIR, labelled as E
in Figure 1.3.
Traditionally, there are three different methods of designing and matching a DS
and all of these have advantages and disadvantages [29, p. 198-206]. A straight
forward way of doing it is to construct a DS half out of three arc FODO cells but
with individually powered quadrupoles. The quadrupole strengths can then be varied
to match the dispersion, its derivative and the Twiss functions. The advantage of
this method is that it is very flexible and does not alter the geometry. However,
powering the quadrupoles individually can be costly and this method usually results
in  functions and quadrupole strengths much larger than those in the FODO cells
leading to aperture and magnet constraints.
The half-bend method does not require individually powered quadrupoles and has
the same  functions as the arc. It suppresses the dispersion by installing special
dipoles with half the normal strength in two or three FODO cells, depending on the
phase advance in the cells. The downside of this is that the half strength dipoles have
to be especially made for this and they have a big impact on the geometry, on top of
that, it only works for 60 and 90 phase advance FODO cells. The missing-bend DS
works in a similar way, by introducing FODO cells that have no bending magnets.
In practice it is sometimes better to use a method that combines features of all three
methods to have a small impact on the geometry but keep the  functions reasonable.

a closer look at the EIR. It then gives a brief overview of possible future colliders
before going into further detail on the future colliders studied in the scope of this
thesis. An overview of the parameters of the colliders studied in this thesis is shown

2.1 The Large Hadron Collider
2.1.1 Motivation
In December 1994 the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) Council
approved the LHC project to succeed the Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP)
after its shutdown in 1999 [34]. The LHC is designed to collide protons at an ultimate
Centre of Mass (CoM) energy of 14 TeV making it the most energetic collider ever
built.
This energy reach was motivated by various theoretical particle physics predic-
tions and experimental sources, the most prominent being the Higgs boson, which
was expected at an energy of about 115 GeV [35]. The Higgs boson is responsible
for the mechanism resulting in particles having masses and was one of the last un-
solved problems of the Standard Model (SM). It was also predicted that the results
might shed light onto questions such as the origin of particle flavours or mechanisms
explaining gravity and unifying forces. More exotic predictions hoped to see evidence
of Beyond SM (BSM) theories. Another aim of the LHC was to understand the
matter-antimatter asymmetry and the quark-gluon plasma making up hadrons.
The LHC has two high luminosity experiments, A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS (AT-
LAS) and Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), in late 2012 both of these experiments an-
nounced the discovery of a 125 GeV Higgs like particle decaying to  and ZZ [36, 37].
Whilst these discoveries were made from beams colliding at a 7 and 8 TeV CoM, the
beam energy and luminosity of the machine have since been increased resulting in a
much larger data set; this has led to further discoveries such as the decay of the Higgs
boson to bb [38]. The LHC and its scheduled upgrades plan to constantly improve and
provide data for the next two decades [31]. On top of this, the LHC-beauty (LHCb)
experiment has provided insights into the CP symmetry violations and made it pos-
sible to accurately measure the decay rates of rare charm and beauty hadrons [39].
Moreover, the A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) experiment has provided
insights into the equation of state of nuclei by measuring the outcome of ion-ion and
ion-proton collisions in the LHC [40].
2.1.2 Layout
The LHC is housed in the same 27 km tunnel that was previously built and used
for LEP. A schematic layout of the tunnel is shown in Figure 2.1, it is divided into
eight octants, at the centre of each of these octants lies an IR labelled 1 to 8 [30, p.
37]. Each IR is quasi asymmetric around the IP, meaning that the  functions in one
plane are equal to the  functions in the other plane on the other side of the IP. The
IRs are connected through arcs that are labelled as Arcnp where n and p are the left
and right adjacent IRs. For example, the arc between IR1 and IR2 is referred to as
Arc12.
Each arc is constructed of 23 FODO cells containing six dipoles [30, p. 43-47]
that are designed to reach up to 8.33 T [41]. The phase advance in each FODO cell
is about 90 which is matched using quadrupoles that are powered in series in each
arc. Sextupole magnets are found next to each arc quadrupole, these are arranged
in two individually powered families and are used to correct the chromaticity of the
ring [42].

Beam 1 is injected in IR2 and circulates the LHC in a clockwise direction, whilst
beam 2 is injected in the opposite direction in IR8. Both beams are injected at
450 GeV from CERNs Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) with a design normalised
emittance of 3.75 m with bunches separated by 25 ns [43]. The beam is accelerated
using the RF cavities in IR4, this IR also contains most of the beam instrumenta-
tion [30, p. 38]. IR4 was also designed in such a way that it contained one quadrupole
more than needed to match the optics either side of the IP to give a handle to change
the tune of the LHC [44].
An extra quadrupole for tuning is also added in IR6, which contains the beam
dump for both beams [45]. The beam is collimated in IR3 and IR7, the betatron
cleaning takes place in IR7 whilst the momentum cleaning takes place in IR3. Both
IRs use warm magnets to avoid the risk of superconducting magnet quenching [30,
p. 36-38]. The beams cross each others path in the four EIRs, two lower luminosity
EIRs are in IR2 and IR8, whilst the higher luminosity EIRs, which are the most
relevant in this thesis, are located in IR1 and IR5 [30, p. 32-36].
At injection the LHC is run at 59.28 and 64.31 horizontal and vertical tune respec-
tively, once ramped up to full energy the optics are changed to collision optics and
the tunes are set to 59.31 and 64.32 [46]. The LHC is designed to have a minimum
BSC of 6.0 , however, it is run with a primary collimators set to 5.5  [47]. In its
design the LHC aimed to have a long term DA of 6 , adding safety margins and
uncertainties this translates to a computed DA of about 10  for 106 turns [48].
2.1.3 Experimental Interaction Region
As mentioned in Section 2.1.2, the LHC has four EIRs  this thesis focuses on the
two high luminosity IRs, IR1 and IR5, hence a more detailed overview of these EIRs
will be provided here.
The EIRs are designed to focus the beams down to a  of 55 cm in both planes and
collide the beams at a crossing angle of 7, resulting in a minimum BSC of 6.98 [30,
p. 47-53]. This design  has since been surpassed by utilising improved collimation
settings [47] and a special achromatic telescopic squeezing (ATS) optics [49].
The ATS optics works by decreasing the  by using the EIR magnets until the
threshold at which the resulting chromaticity can still be compensated using the arc
sextupoles. The  is then further decreased by increasing the  functions in the arcs
adjacent to the EIR whilst leaving the EIR magnets unchanged. The increased arc
 functions result in a higher efficiency of the sextupole correction as given by Equa-
tion 1.35 so that the chromaticity due to the lower  can still be compensated [42].
All these low  optics are achieved with a superconducting triplet located at an
L of 23 m [50]. The triplet was optimised to be symmetric [51] with Q1 and Q3
being the same length and Q2 split into two sub-magnets Q2a and Q2b. Q1 and
Q3 are 6.3 m long and the sub-magnets of Q2 are 5.5 m, the main quadrupoles are
separated by 3.5 m leaving space for dipole kickers, collimators and beam position
monitors (BPMs). The two Q2 magnets are 1 m apart and with a dipole kicker in
between [52]. All three magnets have a field of 205 Tm1 at collision and are powered
in series but can be shunted individually using dedicated trim converters [53].
A skew quadrupole as well as two non-linear corrector magnets are located adja-
cent to Q3 in order to compensate for coupling and reduce the orbit distorting terms.
The non-linear correctors can produce sextupole, octupole and dodecapole fields as
well as skew sextupole and octupole fields. These can be used to compensate for
errors in the triplet but also the dipole magnets [13].
The separation is achieved using a normal conducting D1 made of six 3.4 m long
normal conducting magnets with a field of up to 1.38 T and a superconducting twin
aperture D2 that is 9.45 m long and can produce a field of 3.5 T [52]. The LHC does
not use any crab cavities since the crossing angle is relatively low [54].
The matching section of the LHC is made of three individually powered supercon-
ducting quadrupoles Q4, Q5 and Q6  for historical reasons these three magnets are
sometimes referred to as the outer triplet [55]. The DS is highly constrained by LEP
tunnel geometry and made of two arc cells that have two instead of the regular three
dipoles per half cell, the quadrupoles in these cells, Q7-Q10 are powered individually.
In order to help the matching to the arc, the trim quadrupoles in the first arc cell,
QT11-QT13, are also used to for the matching. These are adjacent to the FODO
quadrupoles Q11-Q13 and are individually powered.
The injection optics of the LHC are designed to have a  of 10 m which results
in much lower  functions in the triplet which is a requirement at injection since the
emittance is larger. When the energy increases the  is squeezed to collision optics
by gradually changing the quadrupole strengths. An overview of the injection and
collision optics is shown in Figure 2.2 and Figure 2.3 respectively.
2.2 Future Colliders
The discovery of the Higgs boson was a great success for the SM and the acceler-
ator community but the LHC experiments have not yet shed light on all questions
it set out to answer. Currently, there are several options for possible colliders to
explore fundamental particle physics in the post-LHC era. In general the options
vary between various hadron synchrotrons that reach higher luminosities and ener-
gies, high-luminosity lepton synchrotrons and high energy lepton linear accelerators
(linacs) for precision measurements as well as ion-lepton and hadron-lepton colliders
for nuclear measurements.

This section will give an overview of some of these machines before going into
greater detail on the three machines that will be explored in the scope of this thesis,
namely the High Energy LHC, the Future Circular hadron-hadron Collider and the
Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility.
2.2.1 Future Collider Options
The High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) is an approved upgrade of the LHC that aims
to increase the LHC luminosity by upgrading the LHC injectors [56] to provide more
intense beams during the LHCs long shut down at the end of 2018 [57] and installing
an upgraded EIR in the long shut down at the end of 2024 [31]. These upgrades aim

to increase the luminosity by a factor of ten to fifteen, thus greatly increasing the
amount of data that can be explored. The upgrade is made possible with magnets
produced using a novel Nb3Sn superconducting technology to manufacture a new
triplet with higher gradients and aperture as well as new 11 T dipoles to be installed
in various location to provide more space for collimators [58].
A more extensive upgrade of the LHC is considered in the High-Energy LHC (HE-
LHC) upgrade, which explores the option of replacing all arc dipole magnets in the
LHC with 16 T Nb3Sn dipoles [59]. This increased strength would allow protons to
be accelerated to CoM energies up to 27 TeV to explore new energy scales. With the
same technology it is possible to reach even higher energies by increasing the radius
of the synchrotron. This is considered in the Future Circular Collider (FCC) study,
that looks into a hadron collider, FCC-hh, that uses 16 T magnets in a 100 km ring
in order to reach CoM energies of 100 TeV [60].
Whilst hadron synchrotrons are limited by the highest magnetic fields they can
achieve, the energy reach and beam intensity of electron synchrotrons are limited
by the synchrotron radiation produced by the beam and the power the RF-Cavities
can provide the beam to counter this effect. This is because the energy a particle
loses per turn due to synchrotron radiation is proportional to
, where E and m
are the energy and rest mass of the particle [6, p. 45], which is about 2000 times
lower for electrons than for protons. This results in electron synchrotrons being a lot
less energetic than proton accelerators of the same size. However, since protons are
composite particles, the actual CoM energy achieved in a collision depends on the
parton distribution in the colliding protons and is typically significantly lower than
the total CoM energy of the protons. Electrons are elementary particles so that the
CoM energy in each collision is always equal to the CoM energy of the electrons,
therefore electron colliders are sometimes favourable as they can be used for precision
measurements at specific energies.
The FCC study also looks into a electron-positron collider that could precede
the FCC-hh in the same 100 km as was the case with LEP and LHC. The FCC-ee
plans to initially collide leptons at CoM energies of 91.2 GeV with peak luminosities
of 200  1034cm2s1 and eventually reach energies of up to 365 GeV at the cost of
reducing the beam current and consequently the luminosity to 1.31034cm2s1 [32].
A similar study is also performed in the Chinese Circular Electron-Positron Collider
(CEPC) study that plans to house a lepton collider in a 70 km with plans to also
install the Super Proton-Proton Collider (SPPC) in the same tunnel [61].
Lepton linacs have the advantage that they do not require to bend the particles,
meaning there is no synchrotron radiation. As a result of this linacs can potentially
reach much higher energies, however, since the particles are lost after each collision,
it is a lot more challenging to achieve high luminosities. Both the Compact Linear
Collider (CLIC) [62] and the International Linear Collider (ILC) [63] study possible
electron linear colliders. The ILC aims to collide electron and positron beams at
CoM energies between 250 GeV and 1000 GeV and reach luminosities of up to 5 
1034cm2s1 [63, p. 11]. Similarly, CLIC aims to collide beams at CoM energies
between 350 GeV and 3 TeV with a peak luminosity of 6 1034 cm2s1 [62, p. 15].
The properties of the accelerators above are summarised in the Figure 2.4 which also
aims to illustrate some of the benefits and drawbacks of all three types of collider.
Other future colliders include ion colliders such as the approved Nuclotron-based
Ion Collider fAcility (NICA) in Russia [64] and Facility for Antiproton and Ion Re-
search (FAIR) in Germany [65]. Another option are ion-electron colliders, two possi-
ble such colliders are currently being considered in the US JLab Electron-Ion Collider
(JEIC) [66] and the electron upgrade of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (eR-
HIC) [67]. Electrons and hadron collisions are also considered in the Large Hadron
Electron Collider (LHeC), which proposes to collide LHC hadrons with electrons ac-
celerated in a dedicated energy recovery linear accelerator [68]. Both these types of
accelerators can help gain a deeper insight into the structure and spins in atomic

nuclei.
Another approach involves moving away from classical accelerator technologies
and using alternative accelerating techniques such as plasma acceleration, an example
of this technology was recently demonstrated in the Advanced Wakefield Experiment
(AWAKE) [69].
2.2.2 High Energy Large Hadron Collider
As mentioned in Section 2.2.1, the HE-LHC plans to benefit from the (HL-)LHCs
Injector Upgrade (LIU) to have a high intensity-beam but collide these at much higher
energies by using Nb3Sn magnet technology. Since the HE-LHC would be built in the
same tunnel as the LHC, the LHCs eight sector layout is adapted, broadly assigning
the same functions to the individual IRs as in the LHC and shown in Figure 2.1. When
optimising the individual IRs, the DS or the arc cells one is greatly constrained by
the the tunnel geometry [70].
Replacing all the arc dipoles in the LHC with 16 T magnets would result in a
CoM energy of 26 TeV. However, the HE-LHC aims to ideally reach a CoM energy
of 27 TeV by increasing the dipole fill factor in the arcs. It aims to increase this
fill factor by optimising the cell layout and by decreasing the number of cells per
arc while increasing the number of dipoles in each cell. Currently, there are two arc
options: a more conservative optimised LHC-like layout with 23 cells per arc and a
more challenging 18-cell layout that adds an extra dipole per half cell [71, p. 45-55].
Whilst the 18-cell lattice has a large enough fill factor to reach the 27 TeV, the
fact that the quadrupoles are further apart means that the  functions in the arc cells
are larger, potentially causing problems at the 450 GeV injection energy. This could
be solved by upgrading the SPS injector using single or double layer superconducting
magnets to achieve injection energies of 900 GeV or 1300 GeV respectively [72]. Apart
from the aperture one has to take great care that the geometry of these new arcs does
not deviate from the geometry of the LEP tunnel by more than a few centimetres.
Moreover, the DA of the machine with these new arcs and magnets has to be studied
carefully at the various injection energies [73].
The main challenging factor for the EIR is that its length is greatly constrained as
it was originally optimised for LEP. The experimental cavern is not planned to change
meaning that the LHCs L of 23 m is conserved. In order to reach the desired peak
luminosity of 28  1032cm2s1, the EIR needs to focus the beam to a  of 0.45 m
in both planes. The increased beam rigidity means that this requires a new triplet.
The new triplet has to be as short as possible in order to keep the chromaticity low
and to minimise the amount of space it takes up. At the same time it needs enough
aperture to support a minimum BSC of 12 instead of LHCs 6  since the increased
beam energy puts strong limits on the collimation [74]. Moreover, the aperture also
has to leave enough space for shielding to protect the triplet from the collision debris.
The separation dipoles have to be chosen so that they are strong enough to steer
the more rigid beams, have space for shielding and ideally compensate for the extra
space taken by the triplet. Due to the collimation limits, the beam also needs a large
crossing angle of 16.85  making crab cavities very favourable. The design has to
leave enough space for crab cavities between the D2 and the matching section, which
has to be adapted to the more rigid beam, whilst not exceeding quadrupole strengths
of 360 Tm1.
The DS has to be optimised to be compatible with the increased  functions and
dispersion in the arc cells as well as the large beam rigidity, whilst not deviating
from the LEP geometry by more than a few centimetres. On top of this it is very
important to have a phase advance of [
] from the IP to the focusing first sextupole in
each plane. This can help correct for spurious dispersion caused by the crossing angle
and will help the efficiency of the chromaticity correction for possible ATS optics [75].
2.2.3 Future Circular Collider
Unlike the HE-LHC, the FCC-hh would be constructed in a purpose built tunnel, the
conceptual layout of this tunnel is show in Figure 2.5. Like the LHC, there are eight
IRs with similar functions but labelled alphabetically. Six of these IRs are 1.4 km
long, whilst the  collimation and the extraction IRs are 2.8 km long. The FCC-hh
plans to have four 16 km long arcs and four shorter arcs, only 3.4 km in length [76].

Each FCC-hh arc cell contains twelve 16 T dipoles, arc cells of this length are
possible because FCC-hh plans to inject protons at 1.3 TeV from an upgraded SPS or
3.3 TeV protons from an re-optimised LHC [78]. The DS is similar to that of the LHC
and is made of two cells containing eight dipoles each [79]. At top energy the FCC-hh
beam stores 8.5 GJ of energy making collimation very challenging, the acceptance is
projected to be at 15.5 [80].
The detectors in the two high luminosity EIR (A and G) are planned to consist
of a main solenoid, two forward solenoids as well as two muon chambers at the end
caps [81]. This setup is projected to span 24 m either side of the IP, additional space
has to be budgeted to allow the detector to be opened and to leave space for a Triplet
Active Shielding (TAS) absorber, initially leading to an L of 45 m, which was later
reduced to 40 m.
The FCC-hh aims to achieve a peak luminosity of 30 1034cm2s1 and plans to
do this by focusing the beam down to a  of 0.3 m in both planes and by using crab
cavities to compensate for the 12 crossing angle.
In a first approximation the the FCC-hh triplet was constructed by scaling the
LHC triplet by a factor of
50TeV
 2.67 [82]. This triplet was then further optimised
to leave the right L and provide the right amount of shielding to keep the integrated
lifetime radiation dose between 30 and 100 MGy, depending on the nature of the
superconducting coils [83]. One of the goals of this thesis is to come up with an
alternative triplet design using a more systematic approach.
Apart from the the triplet, the rest of this alternative EIR is based on the baseline
EIR [82]. Initially superconducting separation dipoles were considered, however, it
was decided to use normal-conducting dipoles instead since these do not quench and
the purpose built tunnel provides enough space. Like the LHC, the matching section
is made of three individually powered quadrupoles. The rest of the IR is made of the
DS and the first arc cell, whose quadrupoles can be individually powered.
2.2.4 NICA
Unlike the HE-LHC and FCC-hh, the NICA collider is already approved by the Joint
Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia, with the construction and
commissioning of an upgraded injector linac LU-20 being under way [84] and the arc
dipole magnets being produced and tested [85].
By colliding ions, polarised protons and deuterons, the NICA facility aims to probe
the in-medium properties of hadrons and the equation of state of nuclear matter. The
high polarisation aims to give insights into the spin structure. The NICA project aims
to measure collisions in two experiments; the first IP will have the Multi Purpose
Detector (MPD) concentrating on heavy ion collisions, whilst the second one will
have the Spin Physics Detector (SPD) concentrating on spin physics [64].
The NICA collider aims to use 1.8 T superconducting dipoles to circulate 22
bunches in a 500 m ring. This will allow it to collide protons at CoM energy of
27 GeV and heavy ions such as gold to energies up to 11 GeV/u. The predicted
luminosities are 1032cm2s1 and 1027cm2s1 for protons and ions, respectively[86].
These luminosities are obtained by focusing the beam to  of 0.6 m using a
superconducting triplet located 5.25 m from the IP. Since this L and the triplet are
relatively short, the beams can be collided without a crossing angle with very low
long range beam-beam effects after they have been separated again.
After passing through the triplet the beam is matched using six trim quadrupoles,
one of which is located after the triplet and before D1, the other five located between
D2 and the arc. The dispersion is suppressed using a missing dipole scheme made
of two FODO cells without any dipoles. An overview of the Twiss functions of the
entire ring is shown in Figure 2.6.
Whilst the design of the machine is almost complete and the arc dipoles and
quadrupoles are in production, one challenge faced by the NICA collaboration is a
large reduction in the DA when tracking is performed with fringe triplet quadrupole
fringe fields turned on. These fields occur due to an intrinsic effect of the finite length
of the quadrupoles and exert an octupole-like kick on the particles in the beam [87].

Chapter 3
Triplet Optimisation Code
3.1 Motivation
As outlined in Chapters 1 and 2, a fully optimised triplet is essential for a well
designed EIR. Especially in synchrotrons, a short triplet can help save space, keep
the chromaticity low, improve the DA and save costs. The large  functions in the
triplet put lower limits on the aperture and in turn upper limits on the quadrupole
gradients, forcing the triplet to be long in order to have the required integrated field.
In future colliders, this is amplified by the fact that the unprecedented amounts
of collision debris require quadrupole apertures to be large enough to leave room for
shielding. Moreover, the large beam rigidity calls for very high gradients. In order
to tackle this challenge one of the main aims of the work in this thesis is to come
up with a way to systematically find the shortest possible triplet that satisfies all
the other design constraints. This is achieved with a Triplet Optimisation Code that
scans through the triplet design parameter space to find the optimum solution.
3.2 Thin Lens Solution
3.2.1 Introduction
The properties of a triplet can only be fully described when the strength of each
magnet has been matched using a numerical algorithm, such as MADX, and the
beam size along the entire triplet has been calculated in order to work out the BSC
of the triplet. Both these processes can be very computationally intensive and it
would take several hours to scan through the whole parameter space. Furthermore,
the solution found by the matching algorithms often depends on the initial conditions
used.
To tackle both these issues, it is possible to approximate the triplet as a system
of thin lenses. Whilst not being as accurate as finite element tracking, thin lens
systems have the benefit that they can be solved analytically and require no numerical
matching. This means that they can be used to perform a very fast scan through
parameter space and provide a good guess for the initial conditions of a realistic
system with finite length quadrupoles. Moreover, the strengths of the thin lenses can
be used as an estimate of the apertures of the magnets they represent.
The idea of approximating the final focus using thin lenses has been used before,
for example in the design of the final focus section in the CLIC [88]. In this process
the final focus section is expressed as a block of elements with the overall transfer
matrix
1/z 0
0 z
, (3.1)
where z are the de-magnifying factor in the x or y plane.
This system has eight constraints and was solved using eight variables in the
form of four unique thin lenses and four unique drifts  meaning that this system
requires one quadrupole more than is available in the triplet. In [89], the number of
constraints was reduced to six by realising that det Mz = 1 can be used to eliminate
one constraint per plane, showing that an arbitrary transfer matrix can be constructed
out of three lenses and three drifts. Whilst this bears closer resemblance to a triplet
solution, there is no freedom to vary any of the design parameters as desired.
For completeness, it should also be pointed out that a mathematically more rig-
orous process is presented in [90], which shows a focusing system as described in
Equation 3.1 that can be achieved with four lenses and five drifts. This solution
introduces a scaling factor, , by which drifts can be multiplied and focal strengths
can be divided, to make the solution more applicable to real life situations, however,
again this requires one quadrupole more than in a triplet.
3.2.2 Problem Formulation and Parameterisation
The novelty of the thin lens solution presented in this thesis is that it does not aim to
solve for the entire transfer matrix and therefore leaves a lot more free variables that
can be used to constrain the triplet layout and length but also vary design parameters
to optimise the layout. In a first step it does this by approximating the triplet as three
thin lenses lying at the centres of quadrupoles Q1, Q2 and Q3 as shown in Figure 3.1.
The focal strength of a thin lens, g, is equal to the normalised field strength, k, times
the length of the quadrupoles it represents, LQ. The lenses in the configuration have
focal strengths g1, g2 and g3 respectively. The distance from the IP to the first lens is
l1, the distances between the first and second lenses and the second and third lenses
are l2 and l3 respectively and results in six variables.
Figure 3.1: Layout of thin lens system as approximation of triplet.
The model also includes a fourth drift with an arbitrary large length l4. The
simplification then arises from the realisation that the key property of a final focus
triplet is that it focuses a particle originating from a far away point at z = 0 and an
arbitrary z = zexit to z = 0 at the IP, again with an arbitrary z
 = zIP . This can be
expressed mathematically as(
zexit
m11 m12
m21 m22
m12  zIP
m22  zIP
. (3.2)
From Equation 3.2, it can be seen that this condition is met if m12 = 0 in both planes
 ultimately leading to two constraints. An expression for m12 in terms of l and g
can be found using simple matrix multiplication of the drift and thin lens transfer
matrices given by Equation 1.20. A further constraint is obtained from demanding
that the total length of the triplet is equal to LTrip. In order to parameterise this we
need to find expressions for finite lengths of the quadrupoles, LQ, the thin lenses are
representing. Since the thin lens is located at the centre of each quadrupole, the half
length of Q1 is l1  L, hence
LQ1 = 2 (l1  L). (3.3)
The half length of Q2 is l2 minus half of the space taken up by Q1, LQ1/2 and the
separation between the quadrupoles, d. The full length is therefore
LQ2 = 2 (l2  d
) = 2 (l2  d l1 + L). (3.4)
Similarly for Q3
LQ3 = 2 (l3  d
) = 2 (l3  l2 + l1  L). (3.5)
The overall length of the triplet is given as
LTrip = LQ1 + d+ LQ2 + d+ LQ3 = 2 (l3 + l1  L). (3.6)
Fixing this length puts a constraint on l3 in terms of l1, leaving three free variables.
Using this l3 is set to
LTrip
+ L  l1. (3.7)
It was decided to add another length constraint to reduce the number of free variables
further. This constraint was chosen to set the lengths LQ1 and LQ3 to be the same.
This constraint is found in many colliders, such as the LHC [51], and reduces the
number of different types of magnets that need to be designed and produced. This
leads to
LQ1 = LQ3  2 (l1  L) = 2 (l3  l2 + l1  L) l2 = l3. (3.8)
Furthermore, the equations for LQi can be simplified in terms of l1 to be
lQ1 = lQ3 = 2 (l1  L), (3.9)
lQ2 = LTrip  2 d 4 (l1  L). (3.10)
These relations also define the upper and lower limit of the domain of l1 since we
require LQi > 0.
Apart from l1, this leaves one more free variable; this variable was chosen to be
the strength of the first quadrupole, g1. The overall transfer matrix in terms of li
and gi was worked out using Wolfram Mathematica [91], which was then also used to
solve the set of equations yielding expressions for g2 and g3 in terms of g1, l1 as well
as l4 and the other drift lengths, which are constrained by l1. The solutions for these
two strengths are
g1l3l
1(l3 + l4) + c
bl3(l3 + l4)
, (3.11)
l4l3(b+ al3)
, (3.12)
where
l3(b+ al3)(l3 + l4)(b+ a(l3 + l4)) (3.13)
a  l1(l1l2g21 + 1), (3.14)
b  l1(l1 + 2l2 + l22g
1l1). (3.15)
In order to find an appropriate choice of l4 a brief study was performed that aimed
to find out at which value of l4 the solutions converge. To this end a system was set
up with l1 = 50 m, l2 = l3 = 10 m and g1 = 0.5 m
1 and the solutions to g2 and g3
were found using this solution whilst varying l4 from 500 m to 4000 m. The results
are shown in Figure 3.2.

Figure 3.2: g2 and g3 found using the thin lens solution for various l4 values.
From Figure 3.2 one can see that the solutions follow an asymptotic behaviour
with respect to l4. One can also see that at l4 = 1000 m the solution seems to already
be within about 2 % of the asymptote. Therefore, an l4 = 1000 m was used in this
thesis.
3.2.3 Tracking and Aperture
The thin lens solution can also be used for a first estimate of the BSC of the solution
that it found. The first step required in doing this is to obtain an estimate of the
beam size in each quadrupole. This can be done by tracking the position of a 1 
particle through the system using matrix multiplication. From Equation 1.39, a 1 
particle has zIP =
z/z, this particle can be traced in both planes to work out x
and y in every thin lens.
An example of various tracked particles is shown in Figure 3.3, which is produced
with a triplet in the same configuration as used for Figure 3.2 but l4 is set to 100 m
for the purpose of visualisation. The plot shows the x and y co-ordinates for a tracked
particle with xIP = y
IP = 1 and a range of initial g1.

planes for various solutions.
Next, the aperture of each quadrupole has to be evaluated. In order to do this the
algorithm calculates the length of each quadrupole using Equations 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5
and then works out the normalised field strength ki = gi/LQi. Using Equation 1.6,
the absolute magnetic gradient can be worked out to be Gi = ki (B). This can be
substituted into the approximation used in Equation 1.10 to give an estimate for the
aperture radius as
ki  (B)
BMAXLQi
gi  (B)
. (3.16)
Together with the tracked 1 orbits, zi, this can be used to obtain an estimate for
the BSC to be
max(xi, yi)
BMAXLQi
max(xi, yi) gi  (B)
. (3.17)
Since BMAX and B are simply constants that depend on the available technology
and the machine specifications, these can be set to one to get a machine independent
general figure of merit (FOM) that is proportional to the lowest BSC. This FOM is
equal to
FOM = min
max(xi, yi) gi
. (3.18)
Since all machine-dependent constants were dropped for this FOM, it is no longer
necessary to track a 1 particle and a particle with z = 1 can be tracked instead.
This FOM can be used to get an estimate of the BSC of triplets over a large pa-
rameter space using a programming language such as Python [92]. Because this FOM
can be worked out using a relatively small amount of simple mathematical operations
a high resolution scan can be computed almost instantaneously. An example of such
a scan is shown in Figure 3.4, which was performed using an FCC-hh like layout with
L = 45m, LTrip = 140m and d = 12.5m.
3.3 Finite Element Aperture
3.3.1 Conversion and Matching
The thin lens solutions provides a good estimate for the quadrupole strengths required
to focus the beam for a given quadrupole configuration. Moreover, the FOM can be

[m-1]

used to get an estimate of the BSC. To get the accurate BSC, however, one has to
consider a system of finite length quadrupoles, accurately matched and with the BSC
calculated along every quadrupole.
To do this the algorithm has to take the solutions produced by the thin lens code
and convert them to a sequence of finite length quadrupoles that can be read into
MADX [8]. This conversion is done using the pymadx [93] library that can be used
to generate a MADX sequence file with a triplet out of quadrupoles with lengths LQi
as in Equations 3.9 and 3.10 above, and strength ki = gi/L. The sequence is then
called by a MADX mother file that can also set the properties of the beam and the
Twiss functions at the IP and compute the Twiss functions through the triplet. An
example of the results of this conversion is shown in Figure 3.5a, where the  is set
to 1.1 and L is 45 m like initially considered for the FCC-hh. The thin lens solution
gives the highest FOM for a configuration with a triplet that has a length of 54 m
and the quadrupoles 3 m apart, as mentioned above, l4 of 1000 m is used.
As one can see from Figure 3.5a, the solution does not result in the  functions
going down to zero at the end of l4. This shows the limitations of the thin lens
approximation when converting to very long finite length quadrupoles.
The MADX matching module can be used to fine tune the strengths of Q2 and Q3
for finite length quadrupoles. This can be done using the built-in LMDIF matching
algorithm to match x and y to zero at the exit by varying the strengths of Q2 and
Q3. The LMDIF is the fastest matching method in MADX and uses the gradients of
the parameters being matched to minimise the sum of their squares [8, p. 146]. This
method is sufficient for this simple matching of two constraints using two variables.
This can be applied to the solution shown in Figure 3.5a to obtain an optics as shown
in Figure 3.5b.
To explore how much the quadrupole strength is changed by this matching, a
script was written that varies g1 and stores the thin lens solutions for g2 and g3 for
the layout above. It then performs the matching and stores the matched quadrupole
strengths. The results are shown in Figure 3.6, from which one can see that whilst
there is a systematic offset between the thin lens and matched strengths they follow
the same trend, indicating that the thin lens is a good approximation. The matched
values are larger than the thin lens values, which is what one would expect since the
finite length of the quadrupoles means that the  functions in the quadrupoles in the
focusing plane are smaller than in the thin lens.

3.3.2 Aperture Module
To evaluate the actual BSC of the matched triplet, the MADX aperture module has
to be used [8, p. 153-164]. This slices each magnet into smaller segments. The 
functions can then be worked out at each of these segments using matrix multiplica-
tion, rather than just evaluating it at the entrance and exit of the quadrupole. The
2D beam size can then be evaluated from the  functions and the emittance, that can
be specified by the user in the algorithm, to work out the BSC at every point using
Equation 1.40.
To do this MADX also has to calculate the beam pipe aperture in each quadrupole.
In the first step of doing this the minimum coil radius required to achieve the gra-
dient of the quadrupole has to be calculated. This is technology dependant and the
simplest expression for this is Equation 1.10 but more complex expressions can also
be implemented. This coil radius can be worked out internally in the MADX mother
file.
Next MADX has to subtract the space taken up by other components such as the
insulation, beam screen and shielding from the coil radius. The simplest and most
common triplet beam pipe geometry is circular, but in principle MADX is capable of
computing the BSC for more complex geometries too. An example of the result from
running the aperture module on the same triplet as shown in Figure 3.5b is shown
in Figure 3.7. The BSC was calculated with the FCC-hh beam parameters [82]. As
a result of the slicing, the  functions within the quadrupoles in Figure 3.7 look
smoother than in the drifts or in the previous Twiss plots.
Pymadx can also be used to read the output file containing the results of the
aperture computation and store it in python. The code can then extract the mini-
mum BSC for each of the matched triplets to find the triplet with the largest BSC.
Figure 3.8 shows the results of a scan using the MADX aperture module on matched,
finite triplets over the same domain as Figure 3.4. It is noticeable that the the BSC
is zero for a relatively large area in parameter space, this is because the matching
module was not able to find a solution in these areas and hence the optimisation code
set the BSC to zero.

Figure 3.7: Example of MADX aperture output for a matched triplet.
A complete scan as shown in Figure 3.8 is very computationally intensive and
can take several hours of CPU time to produce. This can be sped up by an order
of magnitude if the domain over which this precise scan is performed is reduced to a
smaller area in parameter space. The location of this area can be determined using
the results of the fast FOM scan since the results of the two methods are in relatively
good agreement, as one can see from Figures 3.4 and 3.8. In practice, when optimising
the triplet for any machine it is advisable to start off with a large range around the
maximum FOM and narrow it down based on the observed behaviour of the BSC.
It should be noted that many hadron colliders have round optics at the IP with
x = 
y and 
x = 
y = 0, with anti-symmetric optics such that normalised quadrupole
strength k(s) = k(s) around the IP. In this case it is sufficient to perform the
scan in one triplet because the anti-symmetry implies that y(s) = x(s) and
y(s) = x(s) around the IP, so that the BSC of the triplets on the left and
right side of the triplet are the the same, provided the aperture of the beam pipe is
round. If an optics with unequal  or with a more complex beam pipe model was
considered the code would have to be modified in order to do two aperture scans in
MADX, one for each side. This modification can be easily applied by modifying the
MADX mother file.

3.3.3 Optimisation Code Overview
The functionality of the optimisation code is shown in Figure 3.9. Initially one can
specify the required BSC as well as the design constraints such as L, the separation
between quadrupoles, the amount of shielding required in each quadrupole and the
relationship between aperture and quadrupole strength in the main python code and
the MADX mother files. The user also has to specify the  and the beam parameters
in the MADX mother file for aperture calculations.
Next, a fast FOM scan is performed for this triplet length and the maximum FOM
is determined. A sensible range about this maximum is then chosen for a more precise
scan where the initial guess is based on the thin lens solution which is then converted
to MADX using pymadx. The scan matches the solutions and works out the BSC
using the precise MADX aperture module. If the configuration with the largest BSC
does not fulfil the acceptance requirements the code goes back to the first step but
automatically increases the triplet length. This is repeated until a triplet with enough
BSC is found; the code then prints out the parameters of this triplet and produces a
plot of the optics and BSC.
3.3.4 Modifications and Outlook
The Triplet Optimisation Code offers a method to systematically find a triplet that
is as short as possible whilst still offering enough BSC. However, the code can readily
be modified to fulfil other purposes. One could, for instance, use it for a design that is
driven by limitations other than BSC. An example could be a triplet design that aims
to reduce the natural chromaticity of an accelerator in order to reduce the cost and
space of sextupole magnets. This could be especially interesting for triplet upgrades
of existing machines where the sextupoles are already installed in the arcs.
From Equation 1.33, the chromaticity is proportional to the integral of k, hence
a new thin lens FOM can be defined that aims to approximate this as
FOM =
kzz 
kziziLQi 
iLQi =
i , (3.19)
where z  z2 was used and z can be determined in each lens using a tracking similar
to that for the aperture FOM. The code could then do a more precise scan of matched
triplets and work out the natural chromaticity using the MADX Twiss module in a
similar way as before.
Another interesting modification could arise from dropping the requirement that
LQ3 = LQ1. This would leave an additional degree of freedom to improve the BSC.
At the same time this addition freedom would increase the computation time by an
order of magnitude. For this thesis it was decided to use this constraint because it
provides practicality and is common practice. However, an interesting investigation
could be a more general exploration of the optimum layout. This could be done for
a single triplet length to find out for which configuration the BSC is the largest and
how significant the impact of the choice of LQ3 = LQ1 is.
A last modification could look into ways of increasing the precision of the thin
lens solution and the FOM. One of the main limitations of the thin lenses is that
they represent very long quadrupoles and the  functions within these quadrupoles
change largely. One way of improving this might be to use several equally spaced
thin lenses with the same strength to represent each quadrupole. This could also give
a better estimate of the orbit in the quadrupole and in turn improve the accuracy
of the FOM. The downside to this is that it would result in a transfer matrix with
gi raised to higher orders. This might make it harder to find a solution, moreover,
it would result in several roots to the equation and it would be harder to determine
which of these roots is a physical solution.
3.4 Fringe Field Optimisation
The optimisation code was written primarily to create short triplets with enough
BSC for the FCC-hh and later the HE-LHC, the results of which will be shown
in Chapters 4 and 5. However, as discussed in Section 3.3.4, the structure of the
optimisation code can easily be changed to solve other problems. One opportunity
to do this is the optimisation of the NICA final focus triplet to reduce the effect of
fringe fields on the DA. The DA decreases drastically once fringe fields are turned on
during the tracking, this effect is thought to be largely dominated by the fringe fields
in the triplet, where the  functions are the largest.
3.4.1 Application to NICA EIR
Whilst most of the NICA design is in a very mature status, the ring has a very low
DA when particles are tracked with fringe fields. The NICA triplet has a total length
of 4.1 m, of which 3.5 m are occupied by the triplet quadrupoles which are separated
by 30 cm drifts. This triplet is used to focus the beam to a x,y = 0.6 m with
x,y = 0. Initially, the optics was symmetric around the IPs and all triplet magnets
were powered in series. However, studies by members of the NICA design team
showed that anti-symmetric layout with individually powered quadrupoles drastically
increases the DA with fringe fields. A plot of the optics of this anti-symmetric layout
is shown in Figure 3.10.
Instead of evaluating functions based on the Lyapunov exponent for many par-
ticles, for the NICA collider, the DA is determined by short term tracking, which
calculates the position of particles travelling around the ring thousands of times and

checks which particles are lost. The tracking is done using the Polymorphic Tracking
Code [94] (PTC) which is integrated into MADX. The PTC tracking is done for 40
particles originating at the IP with the initial x coordinate increasing from 0 to 2 cm
over 2000 turns and similarly 40 particles with the initial y coordinates in the same
range. PTC calculates the positions of each particle every turn for on momentum
particles and a ring with no magnet errors. It then determines which particles are
lost before the 2000 turns were completed. The positions obtained from this tracking
are shown in Figures 3.11a and 3.11b, from which one can also get a qualitative idea
of the stable area in phase space.
For these optics the PTC tracking determined that the particle with the largest
amplitude that was not lost had an initial amplitude of xmax = 7.0 mm, this can also

be seen from Figure 3.11a. Since x = 0 and at the IP, one can use Equation 1.39 to
show that
xmax = NDAx = NDA
xx, (3.20)
where NDA is the size of the DA in units of standard deviation. This can be rearranged
to give
NDA =
x2max
. (3.21)
Using x = 0.6 m and  = 1 m this yields a DA of approximately 9.0 . The last
stable particle in the vertical plane originates at ymax = 6.0 mm. Since 
 and  are
the same in both planes, the DA in the vertical plane can be worked out using the
same constants to give 7.7 .
3.4.2 Tracking with Fringe Field Kicks
Since the fringe fields in the triplet are thought to be one of the biggest factors con-
tributing to the low DA [95], an optimisation of the triplet to reduce this effect could
help improve the DA. The infrastructure created for the triplet optimisation code can
be exploited for this optimisation. The thin lens solution and translation to MADX
can be used to define a wide variety of triplets, however, instead of testing these
triplets for BSC, the code can test for a metric that tries to measure the magnitude
of the fringe field effects.
Because the design of NICA is in a very mature stage, there is very little room to
adjust the length of the triplet, therefore it can be kept constant during these scans
with LTrip = 4.2 m and d = 0.3 m. Moreover, the constraint LQ1 = LQ3 was not
applied in this design as it was not valid in the initial design. This leads to a new
free variable so that l2 can also be varied.
The scan was set up to probe thirty values of l1 and l2 as well as six values of g1.
The lower resolution in g1 than in the other variables can be justified by the results
of Figure 3.8 that show the BSC slopes steeper as you go along the l1 axis than as
you go the k1LQ1 axis. This is probably because for a given spatial configuration, the
MADX matching might converge to a similar solution.
The triplets are imported into MADX and matched in the same way as was done
for the aperture code. The key difference being that this was done for all triplets and
there was no selection performed using thin lenses. Since the aperture module was
not used in this case the MADX computations are significantly faster. The strengths
of the matched quadrupoles are read out using pymadx.
Since PTC tracking would require a more carefully matched machine, which has
to be done by hand for each triplet, a simplified tracking is done in the python
script. This tracking traces the paths of 200 random particles originating from the
IP through the triplet using the transfer matrices for a finite quadrupole and drift
given by Equations 1.19 and 1.18. The same random particles with initial positions
and momenta are computed using normal distributions in x, y, x and y with a zero
mean and a variance of z =
zz and z =
z/z , as defined in Equation 1.39,
were used for each triplet.
Initially, the tracking is performed without fringe field effects and the co-ordinates
of each particle at the exit is recorded. The tracking is then repeated but with fringe
fields kicks applied to each particle at the entrance and exit of each quadrupole. The
fringe field kicks at the entrance are given as [96]
(x3 + 3xy2), (3.22)
x = 
[(x2 + y2)x  2xyy], (3.23)
y = 
(3x2y + y3), (3.24)
y =
[(x2 + y2)y  2xyx], (3.25)
where the sign is reversed at the exit.
The effect the fringe fields have on the particles can be determined by comparing
the final positions of the particles without and with fringe field kicks. To quantify
how big this effect is, a second figure of merit was defined as
FOMfr =
|z0,i  zfr,i| 
|z0,i  zfr,i|, (3.26)
where z =
, z =
and the indices 0 and fr refer to the particles tracked
without and with fringe fields respectively. For every spatial configuration, the triplet
strength solution with the lowest FOMfr is recorded and the corresponding FOMfr
is written into a file for further evaluation and processing.
3.4.3 Symmetric and Anti-Symmetric Solutions
As mentioned above, the NICA collaboration found that the DA was improved when
an anti-symmetric optics was implemented. To test the hypothesis if anti-symmetric
triplets are automatically advantageous and to understand the general relationship
between symmetry of the triplets and DA, the code was modified again to explore
EIRs with different symmetries.
This is done by creating and matching triplets as before but then performing the
tracking not from the IP to the exit through a single triplet but from the entrance
of the system, through a triplet, the IP and another triplet to the other exit of the
system. The second triplet can be set to be symmetric or anti-symmetric compared
to the first matched one.
Since the optics at the entrance depend heavily on the matching, the coordinates
of the tracked particles at the entrance are determined by tracking 200 particles from
the IP distributed in the same way as described in Section 3.4.2 back to the entrance of
the system without any fringe field kicks. The particles are then tracked to the exit
of the system with fringe field kicks with a symmetric and anti-symmetric layout.
Due to symmetry, the tracking without fringe field does not have to be repeated
since zexit = zentrance in the symmetric case and
xexit

in the anti-
symmetric case. The FOMfr is recorded for both the symmetric and anti-symmetric
cases and written into separate files.

3.4.4 Results
The results from the optimisation code are shown in Figure 3.12, where the logarithm
of the FOMfr is plotted to show the difference between the various configurations
more clearly. Overall the results of the two scans show very similar structures for
the symmetric and anti-symmetric case with the lowest FOM achieved with an anti-
symmetric triplet with l1 = 5.63 m and l3 = 1.21 m.
For a better comparison of the symmetric and anti-symmetric layouts, the FOM
was compared for each layout and the results are plotted in Figure 3.13, where blue
squares represent areas where anti-symmetric triplets are preferable and yellow rep-
resents areas where symmetric triplets have a lower FOM. From this one can see
that the anti-symmetric configuration is indeed better in most situations, however,
in the areas where the FOM is especially low, the symmetric configuration seems to
be better.

The design parameters of the optimum triplet found are shown in Table 3.1. A
significant observation one can make from these results is that the last quadrupole is
field free, making this triplet a doublet solution. The doublet was integrated into the
EIR and the optics was re-matched, the result is shown in Figure 3.14.

The results are shown in Figures 3.15a and 3.15b with the last surviving particle
at xmax = 8.0 mm and ymax = 5.5 mm. This translates to a DA of 10  in the
horizontal and 7.1  in the vertical plane. Compared to the original triplet this is
an improvement of 11% in the horizontal and a decrease of 8% in the vertical plane.

Overall, however this translates to a large improvement in the DA that supports the
results of the FOM.
In order to increase the DA further the entire space available can be used for the
doublet so that the focusing can be achieved with lower gradient quadrupoles. To
do this the code can be modified to restrict LQ3 = 2 cm and only use the strengths
of Q1 and Q2 for the matching. This was done and parameters of the optimum
doublet found is shown in Table 3.2. In this case the optimum solution was found in
a symmetric case, so a symmetric triplet was integrated into the EIR and matched
to the arc as shown in Figure 3.16.
Again the tracking was repeated using the PTC tracking module for short term
DA tracking in MADX with the new optics. The results are shown in Figures 3.17a
and 3.17b. The last stable particles after 2000 circulations are at xmax = 8.5 mm

and ymax = 9.0 mm, which corresponds to 11.0  and 11.6  respectively. This is
a significant increase in DA by 22% in the horizontal and 51% in the vertical plane
compared to the original anti-symmetric triplet. Moreover, these values of over 10 
mean that the DA is a lot more robust once magnet errors are added on top of the
fringe fields and more long term tracking is applied.
Overall, the optimisation of the NICA triplet has shown that the triplet code can
be altered very easily to fulfil other tasks instead of aperture optimisation. By using
a FOM that is based on a simplified particle tracking and by scanning through the
parameter space important insights into the effect symmetry has on the DA with
fringe field effects were made. The fact that the triplet optimisation converged to a
doublet like configuration inspired the installation of a doublet in order to increase the
DA, the benefit of which was not initially obvious. Most importantly, the optimisation
code helped come up with a design with a much larger DA than before, providing
the NICA collaboration a possible alternative should the low DA of the initial design
persist and cause problems.
3.5 Conclusion and Outlook
In the first half of this chapter a Triplet Optimisation Code was introduced that
can be used to find the shortest possible triplet that has apertures large enough to
accommodate enough shielding and is able to fulfil the optics requirement. In a first
approximation the code uses an analytic solution obtained from a simplified thin lens
system. The novelty of this solution is that it simplifies the focusing properties of
a triplet to a single constraint per plane, leaving many degrees of freedom for the
optimisation. The code then uses a thin lens FOM to identify a smaller area in
parameter space in which a more precise scan can be performed. The more precise
scan uses the thin lens solutions as a first guess that is converted into a finite length
equivalent and passed into MADX for precise matching and aperture computations.
This Triplet Optimisation Code can be used to quickly and systematically find the
shortest possible triplet for a given accelerator. On top of this, the tools developed
during this process can be modified in order to solve other triplet optimisation prob-
lems. This is demonstrated by exploring the effect of fringe fields on the DA of the
NICA accelerator. To do this, the paths of test particles are tracked through the EIR
with a pair of matched triplets with and without fringe field effects to identify the
configurations where the fringe fields have the smallest impact. This process resulted
in a symmetric doublet which significantly increases the DA once integrated into the
lattice. The fact that the optimisation resulted in a doublet shows the benefit of
this type of optimisation, which assumes very little prior information. This moti-
vates further expanding the range of applications of these tools to a wider selection
of machines and problems. One aspect not considered in this study is the impact the
size of the magnetic aperture has on the fringe fields. The doublet has significantly
larger  functions in the triplet requiring a larger aperture. exploring this would be
a possible extension of this study.
Chapter 4
FCC-hh Triplet Optimisation
4.1 Motivation
As mentioned in Chapter 2, the baseline design for the FCC-hh EIR contains a triplet
based on a scaled LHC triplet. Before optimisation, this triplet was so long that the
EIR length had to be increased from 1.4 km to 1.6 km. Along with the more general
reasons for finding a short triplet outlined in Section 3.1, this was another motivation
to find a short triplet using the optimisation code. Moreover, designing a triplet
without basing it on any prior assumptions or knowledge about ideal designs can
lead to a design more tailored to the individual situation. Or alternatively, if the
alternative design converges to a triplet similar to the baseline, it could confirm the
assumptions used so far.
4.2 Design Goals
The triplet has to be able to achieve a  of at least 0.3 m and ideally have a  reach
slightly lower than this, which would provide a handle to increase the peak luminosity
if needed. It also has to support a crossing angle of 15.5 , which translates to 176 rad
in the  = 0.3 m case with a HL-LHC like normalised emittance of 2.2 m. The
triplet has to do this whilst leaving a BSC of 15.5 . This has to be achieved for on
momentum particles with no alignment tolerances but with closed orbit tolerances of
2 mm and a  beating of 20 %.
The aperture also has to have enough space for shielding to protect the triplet from
collision debris. Since the levels of debris produced in the FCC-hh are unprecedented
and the way this debris is spread along the triplet depends largely on the design and
the length of the triplet, the amount of shielding required to protect the triplet was
initially unknown. Therefore, the triplet optics design was done in close co-operation
with energy deposition studies done using the FLUKA code [97].
The way this co-operation works is that a first estimate of the required shielding is
made and the Triplet Optimisation Code is used to find the ideal triplet for this case.
This triplet is then integrated into the EIR and the shielding is slightly adjusted to
be compatible with the matched optics. The energy deposition in the matched triplet
is then tested using a FLUKA model. Based on the results the shielding estimate is
increased or decreased and the optimisation, matching and testing is repeated. This
is done until a triplet that meets all criteria is found, this work flow is illustrated
in Figure 4.1. Moreover, if design criteria in the machine slightly change during
the optimisation process, they can be adjusted in the various processes during the
iterations.

4.3 Application of Triplet Code
4.3.1 Input and Modifications
Based on the design specifications of the BPMs and orbit correctors, that have to
be nested in the FCC-hh triplet, the main quadrupoles Q1, Q2 and Q3 had to be
separated by 5 m drifts to allow enough space to install these elements. Moreover,
the main quadrupoles have to be split into sub-magnets that are no longer than 15 m
for transport purposes. Each sub-magnet has to be housed in an individual cryostat;
the end caps and connectors of these cryostats take up some space, resulting in the
sub-magnets having 2 m drifts between them.
Since the triplet code only takes into account the drifts between the main quadrupoles,
the distance between the sub-magnets has to be added to these drifts in a first ap-
proximation. Based on the results in [82] it can be expected that the triplet found

has a magnetic length of  100 m. This would result in 100 m/15 m  7 sub-magnets
spaced by 2 m each. Hence the quadrupole separation in the triplet code was set to
5 m + 14 m
= 12 m.
The BSC is calculated using the beam parameters of the FCC-hh with the toler-
ances outlined above. Whilst the individual beams need a BSC of 15.5 , this BSC
also has to take into account the reduction of the BSC due to the beams not travel-
ling through the centre of the quadrupoles. The crossing angle of 15.5  results in a
beam-beam separation of 15.5  in the quadrupoles. As illustrated in Figure 4.2, this
is equivalent to one beam with 1.5  15.5  = 23.25  BSC travelling through the
centre of the quadrupole. Hence, the Optimisation Code is set to find the shortest
possible triplet with 23.25 minimum BSC.
The final drift, L, is set to 45 m and the  functions at the IP are set to x =
y = 0.2 m, which is slightly lower than the experimental requirements but ensures
the triplet is able to have some margin to achieve lower . After an initial run with
larger BSC scans around the highest FOM, it was found that an interval of l1  6%
and g1  0.005 m1 at a resolution of 25 12 around the maximum FOM was most
suitable for the precise scan in this situation. Finally, l4 was set to 500 m as an
approximation of the distance between the triplet and the matching section.
4.3.2 Field vs. Aperture
Initially the coil aperture for a given quadrupole gradient was approximated using
Equation 1.10, with B = 11 T. After consultation with the FCC-hh magnet design
team an estimate of the achievable gradient for a set of coil radii was produced [98],
the estimates produced by the magnet team are shown in Table 4.1. In order to find
a function that describes the relationship between the radius, r, and the gradient, G,
as described in Table 4.1, the data was fitted using a function of the form
, (4.1)
where  and A are determined from the fitting. The line of best fit was found
with A = 29.96 and  = 1.215. The fact that  > 1, as we would expect from
Equation 1.10, implies that Equation 1.10 is an overestimate at very high gradients.
The values from Table 4.1 as well as the exponential fit of Equation 4.1 are shown in
Figure 4.3, which also shows points calculated using Equation 1.10 and B = 11 T.

From Figure 4.3, one can see that the B/G is a relatively good first approximation,
therefore it was kept for the thin lens FOM.
The MADX mother file was modified to read out the strength of the matched
triplet quadrupoles and work out the coil radii using Equation 4.1. The MADX code
then subtracts the widths of the cold bore, the liquid helium cooling channel, the
kapton insulation, the beam screen and the beam screen insulation from the coil
radius to work out the aperture available for the beam and shielding. The widths of
these components for the FCC-hh were established together with the beam screen and
magnet design team and are shown in Table 4.2. Finally, the width of the shielding
has to be subtracted from this radius to work out the aperture available for the beams.
This circular aperture can then be used for the the MADX aperture module.
In the first iterations the aperture for each quadrupole was calculated individually

and all quadrupoles had different apertures. However, it was soon found that the
collision debris would be spread more evenly throughout the triplet and there would
be less peaks if all quadrupoles had a similar aperture. Therefore, the code was
modified to use the largest quadrupole gradient from all three quadrupoles to compute
the coil radius of all magnets. This would not only help reduce radiation peaks, but
also reduce the number of different types of magnets that have to be designed and
produced for the triplets.
4.3.3 Energy Deposition Studies
Whilst the energy deposition studies were not done in the scope of this thesis, the co-
operation between the optics design and the energy deposition studies is an integral
part of the work. Therefore, for completeness, the FLUKA model is briefly described
here, a more detailed overview can be found in [100] and [101].
The collision debris at the IP was taken from proton-proton collision simulations
using the DPMJET-III generator [102]. As well as the quadrupoles and dipole kickers,
the full FLUKA model contains a Target Absorber Neutral (TAN) in front of the
triplet, to shield it from the debris. A typical cross section of the FLUKA model of the

quadrupoles is shown in Figure 4.4, the model allowed one to easily parameterise the
various apertures and thicknesses and adapt the model during the design iterations.
4.4 45 m L Solution
After several iterations the optimum solution is found for a triplet that has a uniform
coil aperture and a shielding that varies from quadrupole to quadrupole. In the
studies it was found that the largest amount of debris is deposited in Q1 and the
lowest amount in Q3. At the same time the  functions are smallest in Q1 so it
makes sense to have more shielding in Q1 and less in Q3. The Optimisation Code
was run with 40 mm of shielding in Q1, 30 mm in Q2 and 20 mm in Q3. The

optimum triplet found using the code has quadrupole lengths of LQ1 = LQ3 = 26.7 m
and LQ2 = 45.5 m and is shown in Figure 4.5.
In order to fulfil the requirement of not having magnets longer 15 m the quadrupoles
have to be split into shorter sub-magnets. One of the advantages of having a uniform
coil aperture is that fewer different magnet types have to be designed and built, this
would be an even bigger advantage if all sub-magnets had the same length. Therefore
the quadrupole length can be rounded to the nearest multiple of 15 m and split into
sub-magnets of 15 m. In this case this implies increasing the length of Q1 and Q3 by
2.3 m and constructing it out of two 15 m sub-magnets, whilst decreasing the length
of Q2 by 50 cm and splitting it into three 15 m sub-magnets.
This split triplet can then be integrated into the FCC-hh EIR and re-matched
to give acceptable  functions in the matching section. Since the triplet is relatively
compact, the matching section and D2 dipole can be moved 100 m closer to the IP
to shorten the EIR to the required 1400 km. The matching section and DS can then
be used to match the Twiss functions and dispersion to the arc. Finally, the BSC of
the triplet is computed for the integrated and split configuration and the shielding
can be increased or decreased in order to give the right BSC for a 0.2 m . The final
design parameters for the integrated triplet after this process are shown in Table 4.3.

The matched optics with the ultimate  of 0.3 m is shown in Figure 4.6, the
figure also shows the orbit of the beam for a crossing angle of 15.5  in the horizontal
plane. The EIR can also be matched and integrated for when the  has been reduced
to 0.2 m and 0.15 m with the 15.5  crossing angle adjusted accordingly. The BSC
for these three configurations is shown in Figure 4.7.
From Figure 4.7, one can see that at  = 0.3 m the BSC is larger than 20 
and therefore lies well above the allowed minimum of 15.5 . The BSC goal is also
achieved for  = 0.2 m optics, however, for  = 0.15 m the BSC is slightly lower

ultimate 0.3 m would be to have a handle to increase luminosity if it is lower than

expected and one of the main reasons for the luminosity to be lower than expected is
a lower beam current than expected. If this is the case then collimation system can
probably afford tighter settings which would result in a lower allowed BSC, therefore
the  = 0.15 m optics might become a viable in this situation.
4.5 40 m L Solution
4.5.1 Motivation
An update of the design of the main detector around the IP reduced the space required
for constructing and manoeuvring the detector in the experimental cavern [103]. This
gave the opportunity to potentially reduce the L from 45 m to 40 m. From Equa-
tion 1.45, one can see that the  functions at the entrance of the triplet increase with
the square of L. Therefore, this reduction of L by 10 % could potentially mean a
decrease in the triplet  functions by about 20 %.
The reduction in the  functions would decrease the orbit distorting terms given
by Equation 1.37 and hence increase the dynamic aperture and make corrections
easier. Moreover, the lower  functions would also decrease the natural chromaticity
of the synchrotron which would mean that less or weaker sextupoles can be installed
in the arcs, which can potentially save a lot of cost and space.
In order to test the effect of the L on the chromaticity, the chromatic Montague
functions, W , of the synchrotron can be plotted for the three scaled LHC triplet
designs presented in [82]. The three triplets have an L of 36 m, 45 m and 61 m,
and have all been integrated into the same lattice version. The W functions are
computed with the arc sextupoles turned off and the results of this study are shown

in Figures 4.8a and 4.8b.
As one can see from Figures 4.8a and 4.8b the chromatic effects depend heavily
on the L as one would expect. For example, the 20 % reduction in L from 45 m to
36 m results in a reduction of maximum Montague functions by about 20 % in both
planes. Similarly, the increase in L by 33 % to 61 m results in an increase of the
Montague functions by about 33 %. This provides a good motivation to decrease the
L to 40 m.
4.5.2 40 m L Solution
In order to provide for the 40 m final drift, the triplet found for the 45 m case can be
moved 5 m closer to the IP. The correction package and D1 dipole can also be moved
by this amount. The new configuration requires the triplet to be slightly re-matched
since the focal point in the two planes will have shifted. This re-matching changes
the strength of the quadrupoles by up to 2 %. This change is not very significant,
still the apertures can be recalculated and the BSC can be computed again. The
parameters of the re-matched triplet are shown in Table 4.4.

The re-matched optics are shown in Figure 4.9, from which one can see that
whilst the maximum  function does not change much, the  functions closer to
the IP decrease significantly. The two EIR were integrated into different versions of
the lattice at different times, therefore, a plot comparing the Montague functions is
not possible. Instead the chromaticity due to the triplet can be worked out using
Equation 1.35, which reduces to

since the dispersion is suppressed to zero. Due to the anti-symmetry, it is sufficient
to work out this integral over both triplets in one plane, since it will be the same
in the other plane. The integral can be evaluated analytically from the strengths of
quadrupoles and the Twiss functions at the entrance of the sub-magnets. For the
45 m L this integral is 1790 m1, which reduces by 4.2 % to 1718 m1 for the 40 m
L as would be expected.

after the shift to the 40 m L as seen in Figure 4.10, which shows the BSC for the
same three  values as for the triplet at the 45 m L. This slight increase is most
likely due to the smaller orbit in the triplet, which is a direct consequence of moving
the triplet closer to the IP. Moreover, as seen from Figure 4.10, the  reach improves
slightly but remains largely unchanged for this configuration.
Energy deposition studies for this triplet using the FLUKA mode have been per-
formed and the peak dose for an integrated luminosity of 10 ab1 for a vertical and
horizontal crossing angle are shown in Figure 4.11 [101]. The peak dose can be fur-

ther reduced by implementing a scheme where the crossing happens in the horizontal
plane for half the fills and in the vertical plane for the other half  this can reduce
the largest peak dose to 15 MGy. The FCC-hh aims to achieve an integrated lifetime
luminosity of 30 ab1, this would result in a maximum peak dose of 45 MGy, which
is close to the lower bound of the acceptable peak dose of 30-100 MGy.
4.5.3 Flat Beam Alternative
The round  optics for the ultimate luminosity goal in the FCC-hh depend heavily on
the crab cavity technology. This technology has thus far only been used in collisions
for electron colliders and feasibility for high energy proton colliders will not be known
until they have been installed and tested in the HL-LHC upgrade [104]. In the event
of crab cavities not being able to perform as expected, the peak luminosity would
decrease as described by the reduction factor RL from Equation 1.43. In the case of

the FCC-hh, this would result in a decrease in the integrated luminosity of around
30 % [101].
This reduction can be countered by designing an optics with a lower RL, such an
optics would need a low crossing angle, , and a large beam size, z, in the crossing
plane. The crossing angle is proportional to 
2 and the beam size is proportional to
2 , so one has to increase  in the crossing plane. At the same time one would want
to avoid decreasing the ideal luminosity given by Equation 1.42. The ideal luminosity
is proportional to (xy)
1, therefore, when the  is increased in the crossing plane
it has to be decreased in the other plane. This results in a so called flat optics where
the  in the crossing plane is larger than the  in the non-crossing plane. The ratio
between the  is referred to as the flat beam factor.
One consequence of having different  is that it results in a different beam-beam
tune shift in the two planes. In order to keep this effect low, the crossing angle in
terms of z has to be increased [105]. An extensive study of the integrated luminosity
evolution for beams with different flat beam factors was performed and it was found
that the loss in integrated luminosity could be reduced to less than 20 % by using a
flat beam configuration with  = 1.2 m in the crossing plane and  = 0.15 m in the
non-crossing plane [101].
The optics with these parameters can be matched with the alternative triplet.
This is done for both a horizontal and vertical crossing plane so that the crossing
plane can be altered between the two high luminosity EIRs and between different
runs to reduce the peak radiation dose. The optics with the crossing in the horizontal
plane is shown in Figure 4.12. Since, the  functions in the triplet depend on 1/,
the  functions in the crossing plane are a lot smaller than in the other plane. The
crossing angle used for this optics is 114 rad, which is equivalent to 19.5 .
Whilst a  of 0.15 m resulted in a BSC below 15.5  for round optics, the low
 is not an issue in the flat case because the orbit bump due to the crossing angle is
in the other plane. Moreover, since the absolute crossing angle is 35 % lower than in
the round case, the orbit bump in the triplet is also 35 % lower in the the flat optics.
This leads to a relatively large BSC as shown in Figure 4.13. The BSC for the flat
beam optics is slightly larger than that of the 0.3 m round optics, showing that there
is room to squeeze the  in the non-crossing plane further to increase the luminosity
if needed. Moreover, there is a lot of margin to increase the crossing angle further
should beam-beam studies find that the separation has to be increased.

The matched optics can also be used for energy deposition studies. Since the
optics were matched for crossing in both planes the peak dose can be calculated for
scenarios where the crossing is in the horizontal and vertical planes [101]. The results
of this study are shown in Figure 4.14, from which one can see that the peak radiation
dose is largely not affected by the change to the flat optics. Again, the peak dose
could be reduced to 15 MGy/10ab1 by alternating the crossing plane.

4.5.4 Injection Optics
For completeness, the EIR also has to be matched with an optics that gives sufficient
BSC at injection. There are currently various injection scenarios for the FCC-hh,
the scenario with the lowest injection energy aims to inject 1.3 TeV protons from a
superconducting SPS. Since the normalised emittance is conserved, the emittance is
significantly larger at injection energy than at the collision energy of 50 TeV. This
results in much larger beam sizes for the same  functions. A special injection optics
has to be designed to ensure the BSC is large enough at injection.
These injection optics require a large  so that the  functions in the triplet
remain small enough to provide enough BSC. The beams would be injected with
these optics and then accelerated to collision energy whilst keeping the normalised
magnet strengths constant, before slowly changing the optics to squeeze the  values
for collisions. Since the normalised strength of the triplet magnets remains unchanged
the injection optics have to be achieved using the strength constraints for the matching

and DS quadrupoles at collision energy. For the alternative triplet presented in this
thesis an injection optics was matched with  = 6 m in both planes. The  functions
for these injection optics are shown in Figure 4.15.
The BSC for this optics can also be computed using MADX, for this computation
an orbit bump for a 15.5  separation was matched and turned on since the beams
are not collided in these optics. The resulting BSC plot is shown in Figure 4.16, from
which one can see that the BSC is above 20  for these optics. This BSC is more
than sufficient but it could be increased further by increasing the the  even more.
This is not done in this case as the resulting optics would deviate more from the
collision optics making the squeezing process more complicated and time consuming
as well as making it harder to maintain a constant phase advance between injection

4.6 Comparison to Baseline
The final design of the alternative triplet can be directly compared to the final version
of the baseline triplet that was designed and modified in parallel and also moved to
an L of 40 m [106]. The optics of this baseline design are shown in Figure 4.17 and
the design parameters of the individual quadrupoles are presented in Table 4.5
As one can see from the from Figure 4.17, the peak  functions in the baseline
triplet are about 70 km in both plane. The fact that they are equal is a direct result

from the triplet being scaled from the LHC triplet design  the LHC triplet was
designed to have equal maximum  functions in order to have the maximum aperture

functions are not equal in the optimised triplet is a result from the optimisation taking
into account the varying shielding as well as the fact that all quadrupoles have the
same gradient. Therefore, it can be argued that the alternative triplet is optimised
more for this experiment.

4.5 m longer than the alternative. The biggest benefit of the alternative triplet is that
it was designed so that it can be made of a single magnet family, whilst from Table 4.5
one can see that the baseline triplet needs three different quadrupole families with
two different lengths and two different coil apertures.
The fact that only one family is needed means that it is less complex to design the
different magnets and easier to manufacture them. Moreover, the triplet requires a
smaller pool of backup magnets which is another cost saving factor. Another potential
benefit of making the triplet of identical magnets arises from the fact that, as shown
in Figures 4.11 and 4.14, the peak dose is not equal in every magnet. The lifetime of
the quadrupoles could be increased by swapping magnets that are in areas with large
doses with magnets in areas where the doses are lower. This could be done during
the scheduled long shut downs of the FCC-hh.
The baseline triplet comes with two shielding options, the first option considers
a uniform 15 mm shielding and has a  reach of 0.1 m. The second option, is
more comparable to the alternative triplet presented here, uses a uniform 35 mm of
shielding and has  reach of 0.2 m. The peak lifetime dose deposited in the baseline
triplet with the 35 mm shielding is about 75 MGy for a 30 ab1 lifetime, meaning
the magnets have a similar lifetime [107].
Both the baseline and alternative triplet EIRs are integrated in the same lattice so
the DA of the FCC-hh can be evaluated with either one. For the alternative triplet
the DA was computed for the round and flat optics with errors in the arc dipoles
as predicted from the magnet team and triplet errors scaled from the errors of the
HL-LHC triplet [108]. The DA was computed in Sixtrack for 60 error seeds with and
without non-linear correctors as described in Equation 1.37 and the results are shown
in Figure 4.18.
Without any correctors, the minimum DA is above 16.4  for the round optics
and 12.2  for the flat optics  in both cases this is slightly higher than the 11.6 
of the baseline design [109]. When applying non-linear correctors, the DA increases
to 25.4  and 20.4  for the round and flat optics, which is comparable to the 24.6 
of the baseline. One reason for the slightly larger DA of the alternative triplet could
be shorter magnetic length, nevertheless it should be noted that both triplets easily

EIRs for alternative round and flat optics with and without non-linear correctors.

fulfil the design goal of a 10  DA.
Overall, the alternative triplet has a very similar performance to the baseline
triplet in both energy deposition and DA. The largest benefits of the alternative
design is that the triplet is shorter, the individual quadrupoles are made of identical
sub-magnets. This work has also shown that it is possible to have a specially designed
flat optics that could help recover luminosity if the crab cavities do not work.
4.7 Conclusion and Outlook
This chapter has shown the successful implementation of the Triplet Optimisation
Code introduced in Chapter 3 in order to find an optimised triplet for the FCC-hh.
During the process it has been shown how findings from energy deposition studies were
used to further constrain the solutions to produce a triplet with a uniform aperture.
It has also been shown how results can be interpreted and slightly modified when
installing the triplet into the lattice.
The close co-operation with energy deposition studies was a key feature of this
process. The flexibility of the algorithm and the speed at which it finds solutions was
key in this as it meant many iterations could be made. The final triplet designed for
the 40 m L configurations is comparable to the baseline option in many respects,
however, it has the benefit of being made of seven identical magnets. Moreover, this
thesis also shows that a flat optics is viable in FCC-hh EIR, which could be used if
crab cavities are not available. This design has to be updated if there are further
changes to the design requirements. If the changes are small, like the change in L,
this can be done without changing the triplet. However, if larger changes are required
the optimisation can be redone with the knowledge gained from this iteration as a
starting point. This knowledge can also be used when applying these methods to
other future accelerators that may face similar challenges.
Chapter 5
HE-LHC Optics
5.1 Introduction
This Chapter will show how the knowledge obtained from the FCC-hh triplet op-
timisation in Chapter 4 can be applied to the HE-LHC. The HE-LHC triplet faces
similar challenges due to the high collision debris and novel technologies. Moreover,
the length of the triplet is arguably more crucial as the length of the EIR is fixed by
the tunnel layout.
The optimisation will go further and come up with a proposed design for the
remaining EIR, including separation dipoles, space for crab cavities and a matching
section. This is required since there was no previous dedicated HE-LHC design. The
compatibility of the proposed EIR with the rest of the machine is also tested with
extensive DA studies at collision. This work also includes implementing a spurious
dispersion correction scheme and a redesign of IR4, which contains the RF cavities,
to help tune the machine.

5.2 Requirements and Starting Point
The HE-LHC would be constructed in the same tunnel as the LHC and HL-LHC,
therefore, the geometry and layout of the HE-LHC has to be very similar to that of
the LHC. For this reason, the lattices of the LHC and HL-LHC are a good starting
point for the HE-LHC. However, these lattices will have to be heavily modified to
include the new arc designs and make the IRs compatible with the increased beam
energy and the Nb3Sn magnet technology.
Whilst the LHC lattice V6.503 is used as the starting point for most of the HE-
LHC, the triplet installed in the HL-LHC V1.2 [31] lattice is used as a starting point
for the triplet design. This triplet is designed to be made of Nb3Sn superconducting
quadrupoles, which is the same technology intended to be used in the HE-LHC [110].
The triplet has a total length of 41.5 m and all three quadrupoles are 3.62 m apart
and are split into two sub-magnets. Q1 and Q3 consists of two 4.2 m sub-magnets
with 0.6 m separation whilst Q2 is made of two 7.15 m sub-magnets with a 2 m
separation in which BPMs and dipole kickers can be installed. An overview of the
triplet is shown in Figure 5.1.
The simplest way to obtain an estimate of the triplet length needed for the HE-
LHC is by scaling the HL-LHC triplet with momentum, p. For a fixed magnetic
gradient, the normalised strength, k, scales as 1/p. Hence, in order to keep the same
integrated strength kL, the length of the triplet would have to scale with p. This
approximation assumes the gradients and subsequently the apertures in the triplet
magnet remain the same. This holds if the beam sizes,
 remain roughly the same.
Which is true, since on the one hand a longer triplet results in larger  functions since
  L  p but on the other hand   1/p so that. Based on this the HE-LHC triplet
would need to be 13.5 TeV
7 TeV
 41.5 m  80 m long. This is a substantial increase,
considering that the straight section has a length of only 268.9 m from the IP to the
Therefore, the first task for the HE-LHC EIR design is to optimise the triplet in
order to keep it as short as possible. Like in the FCC-hh, the optimisation also has
to include finding the right amount of shielding since both the energy and the peak
luminosity will be much higher than in the HL-LHC. The increased shielding is a
factor that was not taken into account in the scaling and could potentially make the
triplet even longer.
The triplet then has to be integrated in the lattice. Since there was no HE-LHC
EIR design before this thesis, the whole EIR has to be adapted for the optimised
triplet and for the other challenges arising from the HE-LHC beam. New separation
dipoles are needed to steer the more rigid beams and achieve the increased arc beam
separation for the HE-LHC. Moreover, the high collision debris means that the dipoles
have to be designed in such a way that enough shielding can be fitted to protect them
sufficiently.
The matching section of the EIR has to be adapted for the HE-LHC, a starting
point for this was the HL-LHC lattice version SLHC V6.1a, which is close to the LHC
design but already has some space reserved for the crab cavities, which will also be
needed for the HE-LHC. Since the magnet technology of the HE-LHC is identical to
that of the FCC-hh the matching quadrupoles gradients must not exceed 360 Tm1.
This may result in changing the length of the matching quadrupoles in order to achieve
the desired integrated strengths.
A similar principle applies to the optimisation of the DS, however, the lengths of
the quadrupoles have a significant effect on the overall geometry of the ring. Conse-
quently, this optimisation has to be done in close collaboration with the rest of the
lattice design team. This collaboration also has to be extended to integrating the
EIR into lattices with both the 18 and 23-cell arc options. This integration has to
include the implementation of spurious dispersion correction schemes and detailed
DA studies.
5.3 Triplet Optimisation
The design constraints used for the HE-LHC triplet optimisation are partly based
on the those of the HL-LHC but largely assume FCC-hh technology. The HL-LHC
triplet shown in Figure 5.1 uses Nb3Sn technology, hence its separations between
the quadrupoles can be taken as a good estimate for the separations required in
the HE-LHC triplet. Since the optimisation code only simulates three quadrupoles
the various separations can be absorbed into two separations of 5.22 m between the
three main quadrupoles. Apart from this, FCC-hh constraints were assumed, so that
the same magnet model as for the FCC-hh was used with the coil radius varying in a
power law as stated in Equation 4.1. Moreover, the different magnet and beam screen
components as described in Table 4.2 were subtracted from the coil radius to work
out the beam screen radius.
Since the HE-LHC plans to use the same injector chain as the HL-LHC, the aper-
ture was computed in MADX using the HL-LHC beam parameters with a normalised
emittance of 2.5 rad, a momentum spread, p
, of 2 104, a closed orbit tolerance
of 2 mm and a beam halo of 6 . The fractional parasitic dispersion was set to 0.1 in
both planes and  beating of 20 % was used. Based on the findings for the FCC-hh in
Chapter 4 it was decided to constrain the quadrupoles to have a uniform coil aperture
in order to have a more even distribution in debris.
At the start of the design process the HE-LHC required a  of 0.25 m, there-
fore, this was used for the optimisation. The minimum BSC in the code was set to
18.75  to accommodate two beams with 12.5  BSC each and a crossing angle of
12.5  [111, pp. 2935]. The initial guess for the sufficient amount of shielding was
a uniform 10 mm shielding [112]. The triplet optimisation was done together with
the energy deposition in the same way as for the FCC-hh. The energy deposition
studies were done using a modified version of the FLUKA model used in the FCC-hh
optimisation [113].

5.3.1 Solution and Integration
The triplet found at the end of the optimisation process was found with a uniform
shielding of 20 mm. The triplet has a total length of 56 m which is only 35 % longer
than the HL-LHC triplet and therefore much better than expected. The solution is
shown in Figure 5.2, the lengths of Q1 and Q3 are 12.9 m and Q2 is 20.9 m long. This
means that the total magnetic length of the triplet only increases by 50 % compared
to HL-LHC. It should also be noted that the maximum  functions in both planes
are almost equal, this is probably a result of the shielding being uniform during the
optimisation.
Whilst for the HL-LHC Q1 and Q3 were split for manufacturing reasons this is
not done for the HE-LHC triplet since the magnet specifications are assumed to be

time, Q2 has to be split into two 10.45 m sub-magnets separated by 2 m to allow
for instrumentation like in the HL-LHC. The 0.6 m separation between the sub-
magnets of Q1 and Q3 in the HL-LHC are absorbed into the drifts between the main
quadrupoles as a safety margin, resulting in a total separation of 4.22 m. A layout of
the integrated HE-LHC triplet is shown in Figure 5.3, for reference it is shown next
to the layout of the HL-LHC triplet drawn to scale.
The realistic triplet is integrated into the SLHC V6.1a EIR lattice, using macros
that are defined in the original lattice file, to help remove the LHC triplet from the
LHC lattice and replace it by a user specified triplet. The macros also allow the user
to specify the location of the separation dipoles and matching quadrupoles, however,
these locations are left unchanged in order to ensure there is enough room between
the D2 and the matching quadrupoles to fit the crab cavities.
Using this setup the triplet was re-matched so that the  functions in both planes
are low enough in the matching section for a  = 0.25 m optics. The ,  and

dispersion functions were then matched to the arc, before matching the 12.5  crossing
angle, this corresponds to an absolute half crossing angle of 135 rad. The coil
apertures were calculated using the gradient of the strongest triplet quadrupole and
set to be constant throughout the triplet, the properties of the sub-magnets are shown
in Table 5.1. Next the BSC was computed using the MADX aperture module and
the resulting  functions and BSC in the triplet are shown in Figure 5.4.

As seen in Figure 5.4, the re-matching of the triplet resulted in the first  function
peak to be slightly reduced. The minimum BSC in the triplet is about 14 , which
gives a very low margin to further decrease the . At the same time, the BSC in
the Q1 magnet is above 24  meaning that more shielding could be fitted into this
quadrupole if needed. A final point to note is that from Table 5.1, we can see that
the fields of the quadrupoles are much larger than the ones in the FCC-hh triplet,
this is mainly due to the fact that much less shielding is needed and hence the coils
can be tighter.
5.3.2  and Crossing Angle Change
During the design process, the  was changed from 0.25 m to 0.45 m to provide for
a slower burn off and a more even luminosity evolution [60]. This reduces z at the
IP significantly, so that a separation of 12.5 is achieved with a half crossing crossing
angle of 135 rad. However, the half crossing angle was was kept at 165 rad due
to beam-beam considerations [114]. In terms of beam size, this results in a crossing
angle of 16.785 . An advantage of the fact that the magnitude of change in the half
crossing angle is the same as that for
, is that the voltage required in the crab
cavities remains unchanged.
Since the increase in  means that the  functions in the triplet will decrease, the
0.45 m optics can be achieved with the optimised triplet. The optics can be changed
by adjusting the matching section whilst leaving the triplet unchanged. An advantage
of using the same triplet for the 0.45 m optics instead of optimising it again is that it
will provide more margin for  reduction if needed since it has been demonstrated

to leave enough BSC for a  of 0.25 m. This provides a good margin to increase the
luminosity if needed, in a similar way as was done for the FCC-hh.
The  functions and BSC for the optics with the 0.45 m  are shown in Figure 5.5.
The BSC shown is calculated for a scenario with the crossing angle in the vertical
plane. The fact that the crossing angle is relatively large results in a significant
reduction in BSC when the  functions in the vertical plane are large. This effect
is especially dramatic in Q3 in the left triplet about 460 m in Figure 5.5, where the
BSC reaches its minimum at about 18 . Since the orbit is still relatively small in
Q1 the aperture in this quadrupole is larger than 30  meaning that more shielding
can be installed in Q1 if needed. Figure 5.5 also shows the BSC in the separation
dipoles without any shielding, the apertures of these magnets will be explored further
in section 5.4.
Figure 5.6: Energy deposition in HE-LHC triplet.
Source: [113]
Energy deposition studies of this triplet show that for both vertical and horizontal
crossing the shielding is sufficient to keep the total dose below 25 MGy for an inte-
grated luminosity of 10 ab1 [113], which is roughly equal to the expected integrated
luminosity of the HE-LHC [32]. This means that the triplet radiation dose stays
safely below the 30 MGy lower limit. The energy deposition is shown in Figure 5.6,
from which one can see that the largest dose is in Q1  increasing the shielding in
this quadrupole could potentially reduce the radiation dose even further to keep it
below 15 MGy throughout. Currently, this is not needed but it is a viable option
should the expected lifetime luminosity increase.
5.4 Separation Dipoles
5.4.1 Requirements
The separation between the two rotating beams is 194 mm in the (HL-)LHC arcs [115],
the magnet design in the HE-LHC requires this separation to be increased to 250 mm
in order to use larger arc dipole coils [111, p. 59]. On top of achieving this larger
separation, the HE-LHC separation dipoles also need to be strong enough to do this
at the high beam rigidity. Moreover, D1 has to be moved further away from the IP
than in the (HL-)LHC to make room for the longer triplet. Since moving D2 further
back is not possible as it would reduce the space for the crab cavities and matching
section, the separation has to be achieved over a shorter space.
These challenges can be met by using stronger superconducting dipoles, however,
the strength of these dipoles is limited by their aperture. The apertures have to be
large enough to give enough BSC to the two beams but also leave some room for
shielding. The strength of D1 is limited by the high amount of magnetic flux that
arises due to the large aperture and has to be returned [116]. Similarly, the field in
the D2 magnet is limited by the flux density in the separation yoke [117]. This flux
is a lot higher than in the arc dipoles because the dipole fields in both apertures have
the same orientation.
The simplest way to reduce the field of the dipoles is to increase their length,
however, since the space for the crab cavities and triplet have to stay fixed, this can
only be done by reducing the drift space between the two dipoles. Furthermore, the
longer the separation dipoles are, the more the curved paths of the beam deviate from
the centre of the dipole, reducing the BSC.
Therefore, a careful optics study is needed to explore all separation dipole options
and find the one that best fulfils the requirements outlined above. In order to ensure
the magnets are realistic, this has to be done together with the HE-LHC magnet
design team. Further energy deposition studies are needed to ensure the magnets have
enough aperture to install shielding to protect them from the radiation. The options
also need to consider the placement of a target absorber neutral (TAN) between D1
and D2 to protect D2 and all the following magnets from neutrons.
5.4.2 Solutions
The HL-LHC design includes plans for replacing the LHCs warm separation dipoles
with a pair of superconducting NbTi dipoles. In this configuration D1 is 6.25 m long
and has a field of 5.6 T and D2 has a length of 7.8 m and a field of 4.5 T. The first
scenario explored for the HE-LHC is one with the dipole lengths remain unchanged,
in this case the HE-LHC would require fields of 18.6 T and 14.8 T, which is more
than 200 % larger than in the HL-LHC and therefore unrealistic. On the other hand,
to maintain the strengths of the HL-LHC it would require a D1 magnet made of two
10 m sub-magnets and a D2 magnet made of two 12.5 m sub-magnets, however, this
would only achieve the necessary separation if the crab cavities were removed and D2
moved next to Q4. Both these options are shown in Table 5.2.
With these two extremes in mind and after consulting with the magnet design
team a more realistic set up can use a 12 m D1 dipole together with a 15 m D2
with fields of 9.7 T and 7.7 m respectively, this is also shown in Table 5.2. This
configuration would not decrease the space available for the crab cavities and ensures
that D2 does not have to be split. Moreover, the fields are slightly more than 70 %
larger than those in the HL-LHC. In this configuration D1 has a coil radius of 80 mm
each aperture in D2 can have a coil radius of 38.5 mm.

Table 5.2: Different separation dipole options in the HL-LHC and HE-LHC.
After including the space needed for the beam screen and magnetic components,
it was found that D1 has a similar BSC to the triplet if it has a shielding of 21.5 mm,
which is slightly larger than the shielding in the triplet and therefore provides similar
protection. With this shielding the radiation dose is kept below 20 MGy [118] as
shown in Figure 5.7a.
The apertures of the two beams in D2 have to be in parallel for manufacturing
reasons. At the same time, the two beams travel through the dipoles at an angle
which reduces the BSC and only allows for a uniform 9 mm shielding. This relatively
low shielding results in a high integrated peak dose of almost 100 MGy, as shown in
Figure 5.7b.
The beam envelopes in the horizontal and vertical planes are plotted in Fig-
ures 5.8a and 5.8b. The tungsten shielding shown in Figure 5.8a is not arranged

in a uniform distribution but in a way so that it is equidistant from the beam. Whilst
a uniform shielding would only be allowed to have a thickness of 9 mm, this varied
shielding can have a thickness between 9 mm and 27 mm. At the entrance of the
magnet this results in less shielding on the inside, however, this section of the dipole
is in the shadow of the TAN so this should be tolerable. At the other end, the shield-
ing is thicker on the inside which protects the dipole from lower momentum debris
being steered into the dipole. This type of shielding can reduce the peak dose from
100 MGy to 40 MGy for an integrated luminosity of 10 ab1 [118].
5.4.3 Crab Cavities
The crab cavities are located between D2 and Q4, where about 20 m are reserved for
them and further beam instrumentation [104]. The crab cavity voltage is given by
Equation 1.44, but for low  and  it can be simplified to
crab
, (5.1)
where crab is the  function in the crab cavities, which is of the order of 1500 m
in these optics. Assuming a cavity frequency of 400 MHz this results in a crabbing
voltage of 10 MV per side. The HL-LHC aims to supply 6.8 MV either side of the
IP using two cavities housed together in a 6.6 m cryostat [104]. The 10 MV could
therefore be achieved with three such cavities per beam either side of the IP, taking
up about 10 m and leaving enough space for interconnects, instrumentation and other
components.

5.5 Matching
The aim of the matching section and dispersion suppressor is to match the optics so
that the Twiss functions are at the correct value at the arc interface and ensure that
there is no dispersion in the IP. On top of this it is important to have the right phase
advance between the IP and the arc sextupoles. In the LHC, this phase advance is
matched to be 2n1
, n  Z+ from the IP to the first sextupole in that plane [42].
This phase advance is important in order to have a high efficiency in the chromaticity
correction but also for correcting the spurious dispersion induced by the crossing
angle bump using an HL-LHC like scheme. In the case of the FCC-hh the spurious
dispersion correction had a significant positive impact on the DA [108], moreover,
this would become more important should an ATS optics be used for the HE-LHC.
5.5.1 Matching Section
Since the dipoles are chosen in such a way that the position of D2 remains the same
as in the SLHC V6.1a lattice and because the room reserved for the crab cavities is
more than sufficient, the location of the matching quadrupoles can be adapted from
the SLHC V6.1a lattice. The LHCs NbTi matching quadrupoles have a maximum
gradient of 200 Tm1 [30, p. 222] and the HE-LHC aims to use FCC-hh technology
with a 80 % higher maximum gradient of 360 Tm1. At the same time the HE-LHC
has a 93 % higher beam rigidity than the HL-LHC, meaning that longer quadrupoles
are needed to achieve the same integrated fields.
It is not known how much longer these quadrupoles have to be, therefore the
required length was determined from the matching. To do this the matching is initially
done without any maximum strength constraints in the quadrupoles. The solution was
then taken and the integrated strength of each quadrupole was calculated to work out
the required length such that the maximum field is below 360 Tm1. The matching
was then repeated with the longer quadrupoles and no constraints to determine if
the quadrupoles are long enough. This was performed until a sufficient solution was
found, the final results are shown in Table 5.3.

Q6 4.8 7.2 50
Q7 2 3.4 2 5.1 67
Table 5.3: Lengths of HE-LHC matching quadrupoles compared to LHC quadrupoles.
From Table 5.3 one can see that the length of the matching quadrupoles increases
most for the magnets farther away from the IP. One reason for this might be the fact
that the  functions are smaller in this region and the focusing effect is proportional
to the  functions. Considering the typical drift between the quadrupoles is about
20 m, as seen in Figure 5.8, these increases of a few metres do not reduce these drifts
significantly.
5.5.2 Dispersion Suppressor
The DS is adopted from the (HL-)LHC with two FODO cells with two arc dipoles
between each pair of quadrupoles. The three quadrupoles are individually powered
so they can be used to match the dispersion. On top of this the first three arc
quadrupoles are individually powered so that they can help match the optics to the
arc. In the LHC the matching is also helped using the first FODO cell, however,
this is done using short trim quadrupoles which allows all main arc quadrupoles to
be powered in series [68]. The decision to power the first three arc quadrupoles
independently may result in slightly higher costs but results in a lot more flexibility.
In the LHC the length of the three quadrupoles in the DS is 4.8 m, this length was
adapted for the majority of the HE-LHC [71]. However, in order to help the matching,
the length of these quadrupoles in the two EIR is increased by 25 % to 6 m. This
increase results in a slight shift in the DS dipoles, which can be compensated by
changing the drift between the arc and the DS. This might have an impact on the
geometry, in this case this would have to be improved in further iterations. The
length of the arc quadrupoles cannot be changed since this is dictated by the arc cell
design which is driven by energy reach, geometry and correction schemes [71].
5.5.3 Matching Results
Using the modified matching section and DS, the IR optics can be matched to the arcs
for both the 18 and 23 arc cell lattice. The matched optics for the 18 arc cell layout is
shown in Figure 5.9 and the optics for the 23 cell layout is presented in Figure 5.10. In
both cases the Twiss functions are matched to the arc and the dispersion is sufficiently
suppressed.
In both lattices, matching is done by matching each side of the EIR separately,
starting from the IP with z = 
 and z = Dz = 0. MADX usually computes the
Twiss functions from left to right, so in order to match from the IP to the left arc the
matching script extracts and reflects this section before matching it and passing the
resulting strengths back into the original sequence. First, only the  functions are
matched to the arc and the strengths are saved. Next, the  functions are added to
the constraints, before adding the dispersion constraint. Another constraint imple-
mented is that the  functions have to be below 3000 m due to aperture constraints.
The matching is done using various weightings of the strengths of the individual
quadrupoles in order to avoid converging on local minima to obtain the best result.

Figure 5.9: EIR collision optics for HE-LHC with 18 arc cell layout.
The only limitation of the matching shown in Figures 5.9 and 5.10 is that the
phase advance in the horizontal plane on the right hand side of the EIR could not
matched to be exactly 2n1
, n  Z+ but is off by 0.14 in the 18 cell layout and by
0.06 in the 23 cell layout. The most likely reason for this is that in order to suppress
the very large arc dispersion on the right hand side of the EIR, the  functions in the
DS have to be relatively large, putting a limit on the possible phase advance. Since
the arc dispersion in the 23 cell layout is lower than in the 18 cell layout, the effect
is not as dramatic in this situation.
Another point worth noting about the dispersion peak on the right side of EIR is

that the peak of the dispersion is in the gap between the DS and the first arc cell,
which means there is space for a collimator at location of the dispersion peak. This is
especially desirable for ion runs since the collisions produce ions with different charge
to mass ratios, these particles can be treated as off momentum particles that are most
likely to be lost in areas of large dispersion. Since the right hand side is downstream
of the IP for beam 1, a collimator in this region can prevent these particles from being
lost in the cold magnets.
5.5.4 Spurious Dispersion Correction
The EIR matching ensures that the dispersion contributions from the arc dipoles, DS
and separation dipoles cancel at the IP to give zero dispersion. This matching does
not consider the dispersion due to the dipole fields of the orbit kickers used to achieve
a crossing angle or separation at the IP. If the beam is on an orbit with a crossing
angle, as shown in Figure 5.11a for a lattice with the 23 cell arc layout and the EIR
presented above, spurious dispersion arises. This produces a dispersion wave that
propagates through the entire machine, as shown in Figure 5.11b. In the example in
Figure 5.11 the crossing angle is in the horizontal plane in IP1 and in the vertical for
IP5 and causes the arc dispersion to be larger than nominal in both planes.
This dispersion wave can have a negative impact on the dynamic aperture because
it breaks the periodicity in the arcs. It also changes the beam size which has an effect
on the luminosity and functionality of the other IRs. One method of dealing with
this dispersion wave that was proposed for the LHC involves inducing an orbit bump
in the arcs adjacent to the EIR [119]. These bumps should be in the same plane as
the respective crossing angles and can be produced using the first two orbit kickers
in the arc. The kicks can be matched in such a way that the resulting orbit through
the quadrupoles and sextupoles cancels out the effect of the dispersion wave so that
the dispersion in the next IR is back to the nominal value. Finally, the last two arc
kickers can be used to steer the beam back onto the nominal orbit.
The correction works because the offset orbit through the quadrupoles and sex-
tupoles induces dipole and quadrupole like fields as outlined in Section 1.2.4. The

phase advance of 2n1
, n  Z+ to the first arc sextupole ensures that correction orbit
does not induce skew terms. The fact that this condition is not met in the horizontal
plane in the right hand side of the EIR in the matched optics has a direct impact
on the spurious dispersion suppression scheme. The first effect is that the dispersion
and orbit can only be matched correctly if a small bump in the non-crossing plane is
induced simultaneously as shown in Figure 5.11c.
Another effect is that the orbit bump is slightly larger in the arc on the right of
the EIR, which is where the slight mismatch is located. Moreover, the orbit bump
due to the horizontal crossing angle is larger than that in the vertical plane with a
maximum amplitude of almost 9 mm. This is quite a significant deviation given that
the HE-LHC beam screen is roughly 27.6 mm wide and 24.4 mm high [120]. However,
this correction is only used with the collision optics which is used at top energy. At
this energy the emittance will have decreased by a factor 30 and hence the beam
size would be
30 times smaller than at 450 GeV injection, meaning there should be
enough space for a bump taking up about one third of the aperture.
5.5.5 Injection Optics
There are currently three injection scenarios for the HE-LHC. The most cost efficient
approach considers an injection from the current SPS at 450 GeV whilst the other two
assume an upgraded SPS with superconducting magnets made with one or two layers
of superconductor reaching energies of 900 GeV and 1300 GeV, respectively [72].
Since the injection energy is not fixed, the injection optics have to provide enough
aperture for the 450 GeV injection, which has the largest emittance.
The injection optics designed for this purpose has a  of 11 m, similar to that
of the HL-LHC. Since the triplet  functions are relatively small, the chromaticity
and spurious dispersion correction are not important. Therefore, the phase advance
from the IP to the sextupoles does not have to be matched. However, the overall
phase advance of the EIR should be the same as for the collision energy to avoid tune
changes during the squeezing process.
The injection optics designed with these requirements is shown in Figure 5.12.

Figure 5.12 also shows the beam orbit for a 16.785  crossing angle in the vertical
plane and a 16.785  separation in the IP. This separation and crossing is needed to
avoid beam-beam interactions that can have an impact on the tune and DA.
The BSC in the triplet for this optics at 450 GeV is shown in Figure 5.13, from the
plot one can see that the BSC is larger than 17  meaning there is sufficient margin
should the crossing and separation need to be increased.
5.6 Dynamic Aperture
Apart from being able to create an EIR that achieves the luminosity requirements in
the space available whilst still offering enough aperture and protection to the machine
components, the impact of the EIR on the rest of the lattice has to be studied. In

particular, the effect the high  functions and non-linear errors in the triplet have on
the DA have to be understood and the scope of the methods to counter this effect
has to be studied. This is done with a HE-LHC lattice version 0.5 which has the EIR
outlined above integrated into the 23 arc cell layout, this arc layout was chosen to
be the baseline in the course of the HE-LHC study as the 18 cell layout did not have
enough physical aperture in the arcs at injection [111]. Based on the experience with
the LHC [48], a minimum DA of 10  with all errors and beam-beam effects should be
achieved. Based on previous experience for the FCC-hh, the DA decreases by about
5  when other errors are added [108], therefore, a DA of about 15 20  is required
when just applying triplet errors, in order to leave enough margin for when further
magnet errors and beam-beam effects are added.
5.6.1 Triplet Errors and Machine Parameters
The tracking for the DA studies are done for 106 turns using Sixtrack [20] with a
momentum spread of p/p = 1.7104 as predicted by the RF design team [121] and
closed-orbit uncertainty of 2 mm. The tracking requires a thin lens Sixtrack lattice
file that is generated using MADX, in order to perform the symplectic tracking. The
error table used for the triplet quadrupoles is based on the triplet error table of the
HL-LHC [31, p. 101] scaled to the aperture radius of the HE-LHC triplet magnets.
The errors are applied to the magnets in MADX before the Sixtrack conversion takes
place.
Three types of errors are specified in the HL-LHC error table. The first type is the
systematic error, bnS, which arises from design limitations in the bulk of the magnet
such as the realistic geometry of the coils as well as the fringe field effects at the
ends of the magnets. These errors can be predicted and measured and are the same
for each magnet. Since the lattice uses thin lenses the average error throughout the
magnet has to be applied to the lenses rather than applying the individual bulk and
end errors separately. This average is calculated as
bnS =
Lbulk  bbulk + Lends  bends
Lbulk + Lends
, (5.2)
where L and b are the lengths and errors of the bulk and the ends pieces. Hence, the
systematic error from the HL-LHC error table has to be recalculated for the length
of the HE-LHC triplet quadrupoles.
The two other types of errors are the uncertainty, bnU , and the random error, bnR.
For each magnet these three errors are combined to the total error, bn, as
bn = bnS +
bnU + RbnR, (5.3)
where U and R are random Gaussian numbers with a standard deviation of unity
generated in MADX and truncated at 1.5 and 3, respectively. U is the same for all
magnets of a family and this term represents the uncertainty in the design of the
magnets whilst R is different for each magnet and the term encapsulates random
imperfections in each magnets. The estimates for both bnU and bnR can be adapted
from the HL-LHC table but the HL-LHCs reference radius at which these harmonics
are measured has to be scaled to adjust for the different coil aperture in the HE-LHC
triplet magnets.
In order to have an accurate idea of the DA the tracking is performed 60 times,
with 60 different seeds for the random variables U and R. This is done by using the
SixDesk Run Environment [23] and the most pessimistic value from all the seeds is
taken as the minimum DA. The DA is determined using the post processing function
of the SixDesk software [23] determined at seven angles.
5.6.2 Dynamic Aperture Results
In order to establish a baseline and to check the thin lattice, an initial simulation
without any errors can be performed. After loading the thin lattice the tune and chro-
maticity are matched using the arc quadrupoles and sextupoles respectively. Next,
the 16.785  crossing angle is matched and activated and the spurious dispersion
correction outlined above is implemented. The lattice is then converted for tracking,
the results for all seven angles are shown in black in Figure 5.14 with a minimum of

Figure 5.14: HE-LHC DA computed using 106 turns without errors and using 60 error
seeds and various correction schemes.
DA of 50.8 .
The next simulation applies the errors as discussed in Section 5.5.4 but does not
apply any corrections. The minimum DA computed using all 60 error seeds at each
angle is plotted in red in Figure 5.14. This leads to the minimum DA dropping to
8.1 , which is not sufficient for operation when additional effects such as beam-beam
are included.
In order to improve this, the non-linear corrector package at the end of the triplet
can be used to cancel several resonance driving terms, as described in Equation 1.37.
This is implemented by MADX calling a python script that reads out the errors
and  functions throughout the triplet and computes which multipole strengths are
required to cancel out a set of resonance driving terms. The strengths are then read
in by the MADX file again. Based on LHC experience [13] the resonance terms
chosen for correction are the c(a3; 0, 3) and c(a3; 3, 0) as well as the c(b3; 1, 2) and
c(b3; 2, 1) terms. The resulting minimum DA using this correction is plotted in blue
in Figure 5.14 with a minimum of 21.4 , which is safely above the minimum required
The DA can be further increased by reducing the linear coupling caused by the
errors. This is done by matching the skew quadrupole next to the triplet in MADX
so that the coupling matrix reduces to zero. On top of this the double tuning method
used in the FCC-hh [108] was applied to find an optimum working point by adjusting
the phase advance between the EIR by varying the strength of the arc quadrupoles.
These two methods increase the minimum DA to 24.0  and is show in green in
Figure 5.14.
5.6.3 Double Tuning
The positive impact double tuning can have on the DA of future hadron colliders is
apparent from Figure 5.14 and from work on the FCC-hh [108]. The simplest way
to change the tune between the EIRs is to slightly change the phase advance in each
arc cell. The downside to this is that it can increase the  functions in the arcs and

have an impact on the efficiency of correction schemes. An alternative way to achieve
the tuning is to change the phase in the IRs between the two EIRs. To illustrate this
concept, the HE-LHCs IR4, which contains the RF cavities and instrumentation, was
redesigned to be able to achieve a large range of phase advances.
Since the HE-LHC aims to rapidly ramp to higher energies it will need more RF
cavities than the LHC and since the beam separation and rigidity is larger than that
of the LHC, the layout of this IR was already being modified for the HE-LHC [122].
The layout for the design optimised for this purpose is shown in b) of Figure 5.15,
which also shows the layout of the LHCs IR4 in a) for comparison. In order to achieve
the required flexibility in phase advance, a fourth quadrupole, Q4, was added to the
design, this is shown in c) of Figure 5.15.
The optics of IR4 in the LHC are shown in Figure 5.16a, which can be compared
to the optics in the HE-LHC with the extra quadrupole in Figure 5.16b. From the
two plots in Figure 5.16, one can see that the maximum  functions in the IR are

unchanged even though the length of the drift reserved for the cavities has increased.
This is achieved by making the quadrupoles slightly longer so that they can achieve
a larger integrated field. Another point to note is that in the LHC the  functions in
each plane have one peak either side of the centre of the IR, whilst in the HE-LHC
there is an additional  peak on each side. This is due to the fact that there is an
extra degree of freedom for the matching from the additional quadrupole.
This extra freedom can be used to manipulate the  functions in the IR without
changing the  functions at the arcs and in the cavities. The  functions can be
matched in such a way to give the desired phase advance in both planes over the
IR. Some examples of optics where the phase advance has been changed is shown
in Figure 5.17, in which one can see how the matching changes the positions of the
peaks but keeps the optics and dispersion in the region of the cavities constant.
The phase advance range of the IR can be explored by increasing or decreasing
the phase advance in either one or both planes as much as possible whilst keeping

phase advances.
the optics in the arc and cavity areas constant and not allowing any  functions to
increase by more than 10 %. When increasing or decreasing the phase advances in
both planes simultaneously, the magnitude of these changes were set to be the same
in the two planes. The phase advances achieved using this matching are plotted in
Figure 5.18. The points are connected using the smooth line feature in Microsoft
Excel to give an idea of the overall range available.
As seen in Figure 5.18, IR4 has a phase advance range of more than  in each plane.
If another IR, for example IR6, containing the beam dump, was to be optimised the
entire machine could be tuned over the full 2  range just using the IRs. This could
be useful for maintaining the machine tune during  squeezing in the EIR without
Figure 5.18: Phase advance range of HE-LHC IR4.
changing the arc optics. More importantly, since IR4 and IR6 are on opposite sides
of IR5, the two IRs could be used for the double tuning process without affecting
the arcs. The LHC IR6 was designed to have a large range of phase advances [45],
therefore this IR would be a good choice for this optimisation. However, implementing
this would require a first optics design from the beam dump team.
5.7 Conclusion and Outlook
The HE-LHC EIR presented in this chapter largely meets the requirements set at
the beginning of the design process. The triplet optimisation tool and the experience
from the FCC-hh design have helped create a triplet that is significantly shorter than
expected. This leaves sufficient room for the separation and matching sections that
have been adjusted for the HE-LHC beam. The layout of the DS might require further
optimisation to help adjust the HE-LHCs layout. Another interesting addition might
be the matching of ATS optics that can be used to squeeze the  as the beam
emittance burns off in order to keep a constant luminosity.
The phase advance to the arc sextupoles could not be matched perfectly, however,
spurious dispersion correction is still possible as shown above. Whilst future design
iterations should aim to improve this phase advance, this should have a relatively low
priority as the DA is already large. The inclusion of beam-beam effects and other
magnet errors for the DA studies would make the simulations more realistic and help
identify potential issues. This could also include further iterations on the double
tuning, which ideally could be done with the IR4 presented in this chapter and an
updated IR6.
Chapter 6
Optics for Experimental
Applications and Analysis Methods
6.1 Motivation
The impact errors in the triplet can have on the DA has been illustrated in the
previous chapters. On top of magnet errors, errors in magnet and beam alignment
and in the Twiss functions can decrease the DA and BSC. These factors are included
in the DA and BSC studies in the previous chapters as tolerances that are used to
anticipate the worst possible case. Therefore, on top of modifying optics designs
to increase the DA, decreasing and understanding these tolerances can increase the
stability and acceptance of the beam. Being able to precisely measure the beam and
machine optics is also important for controlling the luminosity of the machine since
changes in the  and orbit can decrease the luminosity considerably.
These factors motivate the work presented in this chapter, where optics and ex-
perimental methods that can be used to improve the knowledge about the alignment
and Twiss function in the EIR are presented. These methods are applied to LHC
data as it is the largest hadron collider and the most similar machine to the ones
explored in the previous chapters.
First, this chapter will present the design procedure and outline possible chal-
lengers of an optics that switches off the triplet and Q4 magnets to create a field
free region for BPM alignment. Next, it will look at the k-modulation method for 
measurements and its limitations in general and for van der Meer optics in particular.
Finally, it will outline a method that uses singular value decomposition (SVD) and
k-modulation data to compute the alignment errors in the triplet and discuss how
this could also be used to improve the  and crossing angle measurement.
6.2 Ballistic Alignment Optics
Ballistic optics are configurations in which a series of quadrupoles are switched off so
that the beam can travel in a straight line through a field free region. The readings
from the BPMs whilst these optics are used allow one to find the centres of the BPMs
and identify the ideal path of the beam. A ballistic optics with the triplet quadrupoles
turned off is especially important since the quadrupole fields are high in this region
and a precise measurement of the orbit can improve the luminosity, BSC and DA.
For this reason, a ballistic optics with the triplet turned off for the LHC was already
considered and matched during the LHCs design phase [123]. Moreover, triplet free
optics have been designed, tested and used for measurements in the LHC [124]. The
ballistic optics in IR5 used during the 2016 LHC run are shown in Figure 6.1 [125].
Next to the triplet, the field in Q4 also has a big impact on the trajectory of the
beam, therefore, a ballistic optics with Q4 turned off was also matched for the LHC,
and this optics is shown in Figure 6.2. The biggest drawback of this optics is that

it is only designed to work at injection energies. Therefore, the aim for the optics
presented in this thesis is to have the triplet and Q4 turned off whilst keeping the
normalised magnet strengths low enough to be compatible with collision energies.
6.2.1 Matching and Hardware Limitations
The ballistic optics must have the Twiss and dispersion functions matched to cen-
timetre level in order to be compatible with the machine and the fractional tunes
of 0.28 and 0.31 in the horizontal and vertical planes, respectively, are conserved.
Moreover, the  functions have to be low enough to ensure that the BSC is above 6 
for a test beam with 1 m normalised emittance. It is also desirable to have an optics
that, unlike the previously designed optics, is symmetric around the IP to provide the

same BPM resolution in both planes. The dispersion does not have to be matched
to be zero at the IP since there are no collisions. In fact, some dispersion could even
be useful for calibration purposes, on the other hand however, too much dispersion
might have an impact on the BSC.
On top of the optics constraints, there are several hardware constraints in the
LHC limiting the choice of magnet strengths. These constraints include that on
the one hand the magnet strengths cannot exceed the maximum values at collision
energy. On the other hand, very low strengths at injection are very sensitive to
current fluctuations so that no magnet strength should be lower than 3 % of the
nominal value. In addition, it is important that the strength imbalances between the
two apertures does not exceed a factor two.

6.2.2 Results
The ballistic optics designed to meet the constraints outlined in Section 6.2.1 and
matched using MADX is shown in Figure 6.3. The symmetry is achieved by enforcing
the condition that  = 0 in both planes. A similar optics is designed for beam 2. The
strengths of the individual quadrupoles for both beams in this optics are shown in
Table 6.1, which also shows the imbalance in the strengths between the two apertures.
In all cases the imbalance is between 0.5 and 2 as required.
Due to the symmetry condition and the extra switched off quadrupole, the maxi-
mum  functions for this optics are around 900 m, which is considerably larger than
for the 2016 ballistic optics, where the maximum  functions were below 500 m. One

consequence of these large  functions is that the dispersion at the IP is not fully
suppressed by the DS and still has a value of almost 1 m, which is larger than in
2016, as shown in Figure 6.4. Whilst this was not one of the design goals, it can be
benefitial as it can help calibrating the beam position monitors.
The effect the large dispersion has on the BSC can again be tested using the
MADX aperture module on the matched optics and the physical apertures of the
LHC stored in the lattice version 6.503. The aperture module is executed with a

 beating of 20 %. The calculated BSC is shown in Figure 6.5, which illustrates that
the minimum BSC is above the required 6  and the bottleneck is in the separation
dipoles, as one would expect since the  functions are largest in this area.
6.2.3 Dry Run Testing
Whilst, all strengths are below the maximum allowed strength and above 3 % of the
nominal value, the strengths of Q5, Q7 and Q8, highlighted in Table 6.1, were flagged
up as they result in currents below 200 A. This might cause stability issues since
the power converters are designed to have a current range of 200 A to 20 kA [126],
however, in practice currents as low as 100 A have been used. The left Q5 magnet
has the lowest strength in this optics with a k-value of 2.97 in the beam 1 aperture,
Figure 6.6: Example of current read out during dry run.
corresponding to 120 A.
In order to test the stability of these low currents, a dry run of the optics without
beam was performed. This dry run was done at 3 a.m. on the 26.04.2017. During
this run four converters were not set properly so they were redone later that day. The
data from the current converters can be read out using the PyTimber library [127]
in a python script, an example current read out for the right Q5 magnet is shown in
Figure 6.6. As one can see from Figure 6.6, the current fluctuated by about 0.005 A.
In order to quantify the fluctuations the python script can work out the mean
current and then work out the root mean square (RMS) deviation of the current
during the dry run. This is done for the currents of all the power converters powering
quadrupoles Q5, Q6, Q7 and Q8 either side of the IP. In order to get a comparison
and check if these deviations are acceptable the same is done with a reference low
magnet current data set obtained from the 2016 ballistic optics run, measured on the
28.03.2016.
The resulting values in each magnet are shown in Tables 6.2 and 6.3, from which
it can be seen that the RMS deviation of the current deviations are of the same
magnitude for both readings. The deviations are highest for some of the Q6 power
supplies, however, this quadrupole was not flagged up and has a larger current than
the other quadrupoles which would lead to larger deviations. After the positive
outcome of the testing, the optics were used for 2017 LHC commissioning and further
analysis [125].

6.3 k-Modulation
6.3.1 Applications and Limitations
In Section 1.2.4 it was outlined how the modulation of the k value of a quadrupole
by k leads to a measurable tune change Qz from which the z in this quadrupole
can be worked out as
z = 
(cot(2Qz)[1 cos(2Qz)] + sin(2Qz))  4
. (6.1)
In the LHC, k-modulation has proven itself a robust and reliable method to ac-
curately measure the  in the inner triplet and hence work out  and distance of
the -waist from the IP, w, and is one of several tools used to ensure a precise op-
tics control [128]. In this process the currents in the innermost quadrupoles around
the IP are modulated and the resulting k is computed using the magnet models.
The tune change is then measured in order to reconstruct the  functions in the
two quadrupoles. These estimates can then be used to obtain a  and w measure-
ment [129].
Simulations have shown that for nominal LHC collision optics this method is very
accurate as it has a 0.4 % uncertainty in the absence of a waist and increases to 3.5 %
for a 20 % waist (w/) [129]. During the k modulation measurement of a special van
der Meer (vdM) optics the measured  deviated from the model by 8 % on average
in IP1 and IP8 with very large error bars whilst it was not able to measure a physical
 in IP5 [130].
A major question arising from this is whether this is due to the method in gen-
eral or if the vdM is a special case. vdM optics are anti-symmetric optics with the
largest possible  achievable with  = 0, that can be used for luminosity scans and
calibrating the beam profile monitors [131]. Given that for  = 0, the  function at
the entrance of the first quadrupole is given by Equation 1.45 as
 =  +
one can find the roots of this equation to get an expression for  to be
2  4L2
, (6.2)
for which only the solution with the negative sign is physical. From this, one can see
that the largest  is obtained for  = 2L, which corresponds to  = L. Therefore,
the vdM optics are designed to have a  very close to L.
6.3.2 Mathematical Properties of Reconstruction
In order to understand the limitations of the  reconstruction for vdM optics it is
useful to take a closer look at the mathematical properties of the simplified Equa-
tion 1.45, which assumes the waist to be at the IP. For this simplified case, the
relationship between the error of the  function measured in the quadrupole and the
reconstructed  can be approximated to first order as
 
 =
1 L22

From this, the fractional error / is

meaning that a
small relative error in  measured in the quadrupoles leads to a much larger error in
the reconstructed . To quantify this effect one can look at the LHCs vdM optics
in IR8 where L = 26.15 m and  = 24.11 m, whereby Equation 6.4 approximates
 25
Another limitation can be understood when looking at the solutions to the quadratic
equation given in Equation 6.2. As  approaches 2L, as is the case for the vdM op-
tics, the discriminant
2  4L2 approaches zero meaning that the two solutions
of the quadratic equation lie very close together. Whilst only the solution subtract-
ing the discriminant is the physical solution, a numerical solver might converge to
the wrong solution in this regime. In the nominal case these solutions lie far apart
and prior knowledge about the model  can ensure that the right solution is found,
however, this does not hold for the case of the vdM optics.
A final problem that can be seen from the quadratic solution is that if there
is an error in the measured  in the quadrupoles making it smaller than 2L, the
discriminant becomes negative resulting in a complex solution. This could prevent
a numerical solver from finding a solution or result in finding solutions that do not
make any physical sense.
6.3.3 Testing of the Code
The explanations given in the previous section are for a very simplified case, however,
they do provide an insight in the physical properties of the reconstruction. To test
how valid these approximations and insights are, the accuracy of the k-modulation
 reconstruction code used in [129] can be applied to simulated data and artificial
errors.
The code reads in k for the left and right innermost quadrupoles and the corre-
sponding Q in both planes. It then outputs the measured  and waist. In a first
step a MADX model of the LHC is used with the vdM optics configuration and the
nominal tune is saved. The strength of the Q1 quadrupoles in IR8 are then changed
manually in the MADX script and the new tune is read out in order to determine the
change in tune, Q.
In order to simulate errors, the change in tune in the horizontal plane for both
the left and the right quadrupole is varied in increments of 0.1 % to be 5 % higher
and 5 % lower than the actual tune change. The k-modulation reconstruction is
then performed on all combinations of possible tunes and the calculated  values are
plotted, this is shown in Figure 6.7a. The plot also contains a red circle highlighting
the location the correct value. Figure 6.7b shows the same data but from a different
angle and with the errors normalised to the absolute correct value.
The results shown in Figure 6.7 indicate that all of the predictions made using
the simplified case described in Section 6.3.2 can be seen in the real example. The
k-modulation code yields the correct result for the modelled data without errors,
showing that the underlying theory of the code is still valid. However, the error in
calculated  can be off by 10 % for tune change errors smaller than 1 %. For 5 %
tune change errors the measured  function can even be off by almost 50 %.
As one would expect from the quadratic evolution of  functions in drifts and
from the simplified Equation 1.45, the plotted data resembles a paraboloid, with the
designed optics lying close to the point of inflection. This causes the gradient of
measured  to be very high in tune space in this region. A nominal  below 1 m
would be in a much flatter region and much less vulnerable to errors.
Only the lower half of the paraboloid corresponds to physical solutions, however,
the code converged to unphysical solutions for a large amount of cases and can jump
between the physical and unphysical results between adjacent points in tune space
with only 0.1 % error between them. This issue could potentially be fixed relatively
easily by constraining the solver to  values that are below L. Again, in a nominal
case this would not be a problem since the physical and unphysical solutions are much

further apart and the solver has prior knowledge of the approximate location of the
solution.
Especially in Figure 6.7a, one can see that there is a large flat region beyond the
inflection point of the paraboloid for low tune changes. This corresponds to regions
where the solutions to the quadratic equations would be complex. To fully understand
what the found  values mean one would have to take a closer look at the code and
the libraries used, however, it is likely that the code just returns the real component
of the solution, which would be  = L according to Equation 6.2. This region is
normally sufficiently far away from the actual solution, however in the case of the
vdM optics it would be helpful to modify the code to return an error message when
the solution is complex to make it easier to spot errors in the measured tune.
Overall this analysis has given a valuable insight in the limitations of measuring
vdM optics in general since other methods can often measure  functions around the
IP accurately but the  reconstruction is prone to give large errors in this regime.
This provides strong motivation to improve measurement techniques but also to re-
think the type of optics used for calibration measurements. Moreover, the analysis
has provided a better understanding of the underlying concepts of k-modulation for
 measurements.
6.4 Beam Based Alignment
Apart from changing the tune of the machine, modulating the strength of a quadrupole
can also change the closed orbit of the beam if the quadrupole or beam are misaligned.
The change in orbit then alters the position of the beam as it passes through the sex-
tupoles which results in the beam experiencing a quadrupole like field inducing a
parasitic tune change. This parasitic tune change can have an impact on the mea-
sured  functions and the resulting  measurement. It is therefore helpful to be able
to predict this parasitic tune change to increase the accuracy of the measurements.
Measuring the orbit throughout the machine can allow one to reconstruct the
initial offset causing this effect. This section will outline a method that exploits the
orthonormality of the singular-vectors produced using SVD to compute this offset and
remove noise. Such a method can help align the quadrupoles and measure the crossing
angles in the LHC and future machines and hence reduce errors and luminosity loss.
The method can also be used to help reconstruct the orbit in the sextupoles and
estimate the parasitic tune change in order to improve k-modulation  measurements.
6.4.1 Data Set
A good data set on which this method can be tested is fill 5380, taken on 07.10.2016.
During this fill both the  in IP1 and IP8 were measured twice using k-modulation.
The benefit of this fill is that the first k-modulation measurement in IR8 was done
with a crossing angle of 230 rad switched on in the horizontal plane and the crossing
angle was switched off for the second measurement. The measurement with crossing
angle should give a clear signal that can be compared against the measurement with
the crossing angle turned off. For both measurements a separation bump in the
vertical plane was turned on so there should also be a signal in the vertical plane that
remains unchanged.

Figure 6.8: Example of measured k-value and corresponding orbit change during
k-modulation.
Figure 6.8a shows the change in k value in the left Q1 magnet during modulation
without a crossing angle whilst Figure 6.8b shows the resulting change in orbit in
beam 1 measured in BPM.31L1.B1, which is located in the arc between IP8 and IP1.
As expected, there is a clear orbit response in both planes.
On top of the data from the measurement, it is useful to apply the method on
model data so that the results can be compared and the method can be validated.
The model data used is generated using a MADX script that loads the optics used
during the measurement and turns on the 230 rad crossing angle as required. It
then varies the k-value of the inner quadrupoles and writes the resulting orbit in the
BPMs in an output file. The script outputs the k-value and orbit data in the same
format as the real data with artificial time stamps so that it can be read in the same
algorithm.
6.4.2 Straightforward Method
The closed orbit response, zco, to a change in k is given by Equation 1.32 in Sec-
tion 1.2.4 as
zco = zq
z cot(Qz)kl
2 + z cot(Qz)kl
zco = zq
[1 z cot(Qz)] kl
2 + z cot(Qz)kl
which is directly proportional to the offset between the beam and the centre of the
modulated quadrupole, zq. The resulting change in closed orbit in downstream BPMs
can be determined using the transfer matrix between the modulated quadrupole and
the BPM, MQBPM so that
zBPM = MQBPM,11zco +MQBPM,12z
co, (6.5)
which also varies linearly with zq. The Twiss parameters in the quadrupole, tune and
the transfer matrix can be determined from the MADX model and the kl value is
given by the measurement. This implies that the orbit change in the BPM can be
rewritten as
zBPM(t, s) = f(k(t), BPM(s))zq, (6.6)
where f(k(t), BPM(s)) is a function of the machine properties of the longitudinal
position of the BPM, s, and the value of k at the time of the measurement, t. The
offset of the modulated quadrupole can then be estimated from the measured orbit
in a BPM as
zq = zBPM(t, s)/f(k(t), BPM(s)). (6.7)
The most straight forward way of exploiting this could be done by computing this
offset from every BPM at every time step during the modulation and calculating the
average.
Before calculating this, it is helpful to get a qualitative understanding of the data.
This can be done by averaging the measured zq from each BPM over the entire time
and plotting a histogram showing the results. Figure 6.9 shows four histograms with
the measured zq from beam 1 for the first quadrupole left of IP8 in the horizontal
and vertical planes with and without activating the crossing angle.
The first observation that can be made is that, as expected, most BPMs measure
a large offset of several millimetres in the horizontal plane when the crossing angle is
on. Once the crossing angle is turned off, most BPMs measure a small offset below
one millimetre but the results are less coherent. In the vertical plane, the histograms
indicate an offset of about a millimetre for both measurements. The location of the
peak is consistent between the two measurement which is expected since the vertical
separation remained turned on.
Another observation seen in Figure 6.9 is the fact that there is a large spread in
estimated offset and a large number of outliers. This makes it hard to justify the
results since a single outlier can greatly skew the results and the standard deviation
is of the same order of magnitude as the measurement. This means the method has
to be optimised to reduce this error, either by applying statistical methods to filter
Figure 6.9: Histograms showing offset measurements calculated using different BPMs
whilst modulating the first quadrupole left of IP8.
the data or by improving the analysis method.
6.4.3 Ratio Method
One source for errors and outliers in the measured offset could be inaccuracies in the
optics model used and effects not taken into account when deriving Equation 6.5. A
simple way of checking this conjecture is by comparing the actual maximum amplitude
of oscillations measured by the BPMs against the amplitude predicted using the optics
model and Equation 6.5. This is done in the horizontal plane with data obtained
whilst modulating the left quadrupole in IR8 whilst the crossing angle is on and is
shown in Figure 6.10a.
Figure 6.10 also provides a zoomed in sample of the plot in Figure 6.10b, from
which one can see that whilst there is a good agreement overall, there are some severe
disagreements, for example in BPM number 719. One solution might be to identify
BPMs that have a large disagreement and excluding their results in the measurement.
However, one would have to be careful not to lose information when selecting these
BPMs.
Another approach, could exploit the fact that there are measurements with and
without crossing angle orbit bumps turned on. For the case with the crossing angle
turned on, the offset can be expressed as the sum of the offset due to the misalignment,
zq,mis, and the offset due to the crossing angle, zq,cross so that the orbit change in the
BPM when the crossing angle is turned on is
zBPM,on(t, s) = f(k(t), BPM(s))(zq,mis + zq,cross). (6.8)
Similarly, when the crossing angle is turned off the change in orbit will be
zBPM,off (t, s) = f(k(t), BPM(s))(zq,mis). (6.9)
Dividing the orbit changes for measurements with equal k with and without crossing
angles therefore yields
zBPM,on
zBPM,off
zq,mis + zq,cross
zq,mis
= 1 +
zq,cross
zq,mis
. (6.10)
This can be used to work out the ratio between the misalignment and the con-
trolled orbit bump and is independent of the model. This method was applied to

modulation.

modulation of the left quadrupole around IP8.
the data from modulating the left quadrupole in IR8 and the results obtained using
different BPMs for both beam 1 and beam 2 are shown in Figure 6.11.
The results for beam 1 and beam 2 in the horizontal plane agree with each other
since the ratios observed by the BPMs are almost opposite and equal. This is because
whilst zq,cross is in opposite directions for the two beams, zq,mis is the same for both
beams. However, again there is still a lot of noise and outliers making it hard to justify
the results. Similarly, in the vertical plane both beams produce seem to produce a
ratio of around one, which is what one would predict given that the vertical separation
bump stayed unchanged. The level of noise and outliers is also very high in the vertical
plane, making it hard to justify the results.
The accuracy of the measurements does not seem to have increased significantly
by using this model independent approach. Moreover, in order to measure the actual
misalignment, one needs to precisely know or measure the offset due to the crossing,
which is complicated in the first place. Finally, two sets of measurements are not
always available and it would take at least twice as long to record the data needed.
These reasons suggest that the model independent ratio approach does not provide a
satisfactory solution and it would be preferable to use statistical methods to system-
atically reduce the noise in the measurements.
6.4.4 Singular Value Decomposition Method
Singular value decomposition (SVD) is a method widely used in accelerator physics
to identify and eliminate noise in a large data set [132]. SVD factorises a matrix M
so that
M = UVT , (6.11)
where U and V are unitary matrices and  has diagonal entries known as singular
values, i. Because U and V are unitary, their columns form a set of orthonormal
vectors known as the left- and right-singular vectors, ui and vi respectively.
For accelerators, it is common to store the orbit data from all BPMs during a
measurement in a matrix B such that Bij = xj(ti). It can then be decomposed,
leading to left-singular vectors containing spatial information and the right-singular
vectors representing temporal information. Large singular values indicate that the
corresponding mode is due to a signal, whilst small singular values are attributed to
noise. Data is often cleaned by deleting i smaller than a certain threshold from 
and then multiplying out the matrices to recover a cleaned B.
The method developed in the scope of this thesis does not clean the data directly
but rather exploits the orthonormality of the singular vectors and the properties of
Equation 6.6. Equation 6.6 can be used to compute the orbit response measured in
the BPMs during k-modulation for a situation where zq = 1 m and store this model
data in a matrix Bm. The decomposition of this matrix only yields one non-zero
singular value, m, so that
Bm = ummv
m, (6.12)
where um and vm are unit vectors representing the machine properties and the tem-
poral change in k.
Since the orbit response varies linearly with zq, the matrix containing the measured
orbits, Bdata, should have a signal proportional to Bm by a factor zq as well as some
noise N so that
Bdata = Bmzq + N = ummv
mzq + N. (6.13)
Therefore the offset can be measured from the data as
zmeas =
uTmBdatavm
uTmummv
mzqvm
uTmNvm
= zq +
uTmNvm
= zq + , (6.14)
where   u
is the error in the measurement and should decrease as the size of
the data set increases. Once zmeas has been found, the error can be estimated as
uTm(Bdata Bmzmeas)vm
. (6.15)
The SVD code can be applied to the IP8 measurements with and without crossing
angles as well as the simulated data with the crossing angle. The results for the left
and right quadrupole k-modulation are shown in Tables 6.4 and 6.5 respectively.
From Tables 6.4 and 6.5 one can see that there is a good agreement in the measured
offset in the vertical plane for both measurements, this shows that the method gives
consistent results when the conditions are unchanged. In the horizontal plane there
is a clear change in the measured offset when the crossing angle is turned on. The
offset due to the crossing angle is consistent between the two beams and similar in
the left and right quadrupoles. Moreover, the measured offsets in both planes are in
excellent agreement with the results from the model and the actual results are within
the error margins for all measurements. This is an indication that the error margins
are perhaps too pessimistic.
The error margin for the crossing angle offset measurements is about 20 %, making
it comparable to similar methods [133]. The misalignment of the quadrupoles can
be estimated from the measurement in the horizontal plane with the crossing angle
turned off. Here the errors are of the same order of magnitude as the measurements,
however, the results from beams 1 and beam 2 are consistent in both the right and
left quadrupoles which makes sense since they travel through the same aperture. The
error in misalignment can potentially be reduced by combining the information of
both beams. For both the crossing angle and misalignment measurements the errors
might reduce in the future once good agreement between different measurements and
model can be replicated.

quadrupole with and without crossing angles turned on and for simulated data.
Another way the method can be verified is by comparing the results to those
obtained using similar methods. The crossing angle measurement described in [133]
is chosen for this. This is done for LHC fill 5422 where the half crossing angle was
set to 140 rad in IP1 and IP5. The crossing angle can be obtained by measuring
the separation of the beams in the quadrupoles using the results from the modulation
and dividing this by the distance to the IP. The difference in the measured crossing
angle obtained from doing this using the left and right quadrupoles can be used as
an estimate of the error.
The offsets measured using the method described in [133] yield a half crossing
angle of 155 10 rad in IP1 and 153 12 rad in IP5. Whilst the results using the
SVD method give a half crossing angle of 149  18 rad in IP1 and 141  18 rad
in IP5. The results of both methods are in good agreement with each other and the
model value. The crossing angle computed using the SVD method results in a slightly
larger error, however, the estimates in crossing angle are closer to the model value
than the results obtained using the other method.
6.4.5 Parasitic Tune Change
Apart from measuring the misalignment of the quadrupole and the magnitude of the
crossing angle, the offset measurement can also be used to predict the new closed orbit
through the sextupoles caused by the modulation and hence estimate the parasitic
tune change. This could greatly improve the accuracy of the  measurements and
the subsequent  reconstruction.
Once the offset is measured, the new closed orbit in the quadrupole can be cal-
culated for every k using Equation 1.32. The orbit in the sextupoles can then be
calculated using the transfer matrix between the quadrupole and the sextupoles. In a
given sextupole, a horizontal offset, xs, results in a quadrupole like field of magnitude
k2,SxS. The tune change due to this sextupole is therefore equal to [134]
Qz = 
Szk2LSxS
, (6.16)
where S is the average  function in the sextupole and LS is the length of the
sextupole. The tune change has a plus sign in the horizontal and a minus sign in the
vertical plane. The contributions from all sextupoles can be summed up to work out
the overall parasitic tune change.
The best way of testing this method is with k-modulation data from simulations as
the tune change can be recorded under identical conditions with and without offsets.
The actual parasitic tune change can be calculated as the difference in tune change for
both simulations and can be compared to the parasitic tune change estimate worked
out using the method above.
The simulated data used is the same as the data described in Section 6.4.1 with

an additional simulation with no crossing angle. The results of predicted tune change
compared to the actual tune change obtained when modulating the quadrupole left
of IP8 is shown in Figure 6.12.
The prediction is in good agreement to the actual parasitic tune change for the
vertical tune of beam 1 and both tunes of beam 2. However, it seems that it is out of
phase for the horizontal tune of beam 1. A big difference between the horizontal tune
of beam 1 and the other tunes is that the parasitic tune change in this situation is
an order of magnitude smaller than the other parasitic tune changes. When plotting
the error in the predicted tune change instead of the actual parasitic tune change, as
done in Figure 6.13, it can be seen that the error in the prediction is very similar for
all situations. It can also be seen from Figure 6.13 that this is also the case for data
obtained when modulating the quadrupole to the right of IP8.

 functions in both planes and beams should be roughly equal in the quadrupoles.
Hence, the nominal tune change due to the k-modulation should be similar in all sit-
uations meaning that the error in the prediction affects all planes and beams equally.
The fact that the error is large compared to the actual parasitic change in the hori-
zontal plane of beam 1 is therefore not a significant problem since the parasitic tune
change is very small in the first place. Therefore, this method can be used to improve
the  measurements by correcting the measured tune change using the prediction.
For completeness it should also be stated that several attempts were made to
further decrease this error in parasitic tune change. The first correction is to include
the contributions due to skew quadrupole fields that arise from vertical offsets in the
sextupoles. This correction assumes the initial machine coupling is zero when com-
puting the contribution to the vertical and horizontal tunes. The second improvement
explored is to add a  beating induced by the modulation of the quadrupole when
working out the change in tune using Equation 6.16. Both these methods increased
the errors in the predicted parasitic tune changes when applied individually and to-
gether and were dropped as they only made the prediction more complicated and
dependant on the model.
6.5 Conclusions and Outlook
The design and elaborate testing of the ballistic optics has provided a means to mea-
sure the ideal path and calibrate the BPMs. When put in context with the EIR
designs presented in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5, it shows the importance of having an
EIR that is flexible enough to achieve special optics when needed whilst not violating
any hardware constraints. One unforeseen advantage of this optics is the large hori-
zontal dispersion that can be used for calibrating the BPMs. An interesting extension
to this study might be to devise a method that can induce vertical dispersion in the
machine to further improve the calibration. Another extension could be to design
alignment optics for the proposed EIR of the HE-LHC and FCC-hh colliders. If these
optics cannot be achieved this might have an impact on the alignment tolerances and
BSC and DA studies would have to be repeated.
The insights into the limitations of  measurements from k-modulation have re-
sulted in a better understanding of the process and possible improvements. This
could have an impact on the accuracy of  measurements in the LHC and future
machines and provide a means to improve the luminosity of colliders. The same is
true for the beam based alignment using SVD analysis. This novel method provides
measurements that are in agreement with models and allows one to compute the
offsets of quadrupoles during k-modulation without requiring further measurements.
This can save time during optics commissioning and reduce the idle time of acceler-
ators. Moreover, it may also provide a means to improve the  measurements by
correcting for the parasitic tune shifts, which was also demonstrated in this chapter.
Chapter 7
Summary and Outlook
This thesis presents various optics solutions designed to overcome a spectrum of
challenges, with the main focus lying on collision optics. In the case of the FCC-hh,
the triplet was optimised in order to be able to deal with the unprecedented high
energies. A flat optics solution is matched to demonstrate a mitigation strategy in
case crab cavities are not feasible. The high energies are also a driving factor in
the HE-LHC triplet design, however, the overall EIR layout presented in this thesis
also takes into account the strict spatial constraints that a novel collider in the LHC
tunnel would face. As well as the classical matching of finite elements using MADX,
an exact solution found using the thin lens approximation is used to come up with
these triplets.
The thin lens formalism also helped to gain insights into the nature of fringe field
effects in the EIR of the NICA collider and come up with an alternative design to
improve the DA. Unlike the HE-LHC and FCC-hh the NICA collider is already under
construction, leaving less opportunity to change other sections of the machine. The
restrictions for the LHC alignment optics are even more stringent as the hardware is
already in place  the optics are designed and matched using finite element matching
and symmetry considerations and the feasibility of the optics was also checked during
a dry run.
In the scope of the HE-LHC design, optics solutions for two sections outside of
the EIR are presented. Firstly, a spurious dispersion correction scheme in the arcs is
demonstrated, which is based on the HL-LHC scheme with a small modification due
to the non-ideal phase advances to the arc sextupoles. The second optics presented is
for IR4, it increases the space available for RF-cavities and is adapted to the HE-LHC
beam but also demonstrates how the IR can be used for the double tuning scheme
which has helped increase the DA of the HE-LHC and FCC-hh. Both these optics
are directly linked to issues arising from the EIR.
Throughout this thesis two of the main motivations are fulfilling physical and dy-
namic aperture requirements. For the HE-LHC and FCC-hh the aperture bottleneck
was primarily in the triplet and separation dipoles as the large beam sizes and shield-
ing thicknesses require big coil radii for the triplet magnets. At the same time the
small  values demand very strong focusing from the triplet. Balancing this in a cost
and space efficient way has led to an optimised FCC-hh triplet produced using a ded-
icated optimisation code. This triplet is comparable to the baseline option but was
designed without prior information and can be constructed of identical sub-magnets.
The same method applied to the HE-LHC results in a triplet that is almost 30 %
shorter than one would expect from simple scaling.
For the injection optics of these future machines and for the alignment optics of the
LHC, the aperture bottleneck shifts back to the matching section. This is especially
problematic in the case of the LHC alignment optics due to the large field free region
and the symmetry causing high  functions in the matching section. Nevertheless,
this thesis presents the first matched LHC optics with Q4 switched off that is both
stable at injection and can also operate at top energy. The symmetry of the optics
also provides a novel aspect compared to previous versions, including the fact that
the large dispersion that arises from this optics is helpful for the calibration of the
BPMs.
Using various optimisation methods, the DA of the HE-LHC with the EIR pre-
sented in this thesis and triplet errors is demonstrated to be 24.0 , which is above
the minimum requirement of about 12 . By systematically exploring the nature of
fringe fields and replacing the triplet installed in the NICA lattice with a doublet of
the same length, the DA was increased by 22 % in the horizontal and over 50 % in
the vertical plane.
The insights gained from these optimisations can help increase the stability and
acceptance of other future accelerators. These features can also be improved with
better measurement methods, which are also provided in this thesis. The alignment
of the triplet quadrupoles and the crossing angle can be precisely measured using orbit
data from k-modulation and the SVD method. This can also be used to improve the
tune change measurement used for  reconstruction, the importance of this, espe-
cially for vdM optics, is also shown. The findings on the limitations of k-modulation
in the special case of the vdM optics is especially important as it can drive the design
of future high  optics in the LHC after its second long shut down.
Overall this thesis provides a range of tools that can be used for various aspects of
EIR design and implementations. Several of these methods have been demonstrated
to be versatile and adaptable for a broad range of problems and machines. Therefore,
on top of just benefiting the collaborations included in this thesis, these methods can
potentially be used for many other accelerator applications.
