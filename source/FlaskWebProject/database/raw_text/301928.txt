THE INTRODUCTION OF AUTUMN-SOWN LENTIL 
(Lens culinaris) INTO UK ARABLE CROPPING 
A thesis submitted for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy 
D. G. CROOK 
ABSTRACT 
Winter lentil (Lens culinaris) (i.e. sown in autumn) was investigated as a 
potential crop for the UK, given previous experience that spring-sown lentil 
matures too late and so yields are small and unreliable and seed quality is 
poor. Experiments were conducted between October 1996 and August 
1999. 
Increased plant population density improved winter-survival by 10% (from 88 
to 97%) as target population increased from 50 to 200 plants m-2 Yield-
density relations were parabolic, with an optimum spring plant population 
density for seed yield between 80 and 120 plants m-2 for both small- and 
large-seeded genotypes. An evaluation experiment including 1 2 genotypes 
identified six with potential for UK agriculture: they gave seed yields of 147 - . 
322 g d.m. m-2 combined with good seed quality. Six of these genotypes were 
then grown at three sites (Berkshire, Cambridgeshire and Gloucestershire), 
selected to provide a range of soil types and climates, and in two seasons to 
assess relative performance and yield stability. Genotypes differed in relative 
yield stability, and observations at three other sites in Hampshire, Norfolk and 
Suffolk indicated that waterlogging was the most important factor limiting 
adaptation. Investigations into harvesting methods discovered that chemical 
desiccation followed by combine-harvesting provided for excellent seed 
quality with negligible seed losses. In a three-year crop rotation experiment, 
the cultivation of winter lentil increased grain yield of a subsequent wheat 
crop by 4 - 24%, grain protein content by 9% and also grain quality 
compared to an all cereal rotation. 
This programme of research has demonstrated the potential for UK winter-
sown lentil, with yields in the region of 2.5 t ha-1, and a gross margin greater 
than winter wheat. It has identified a suitable genotype (W A 8649090 from 
the USA) and agronomy package for the crop under UK conditions, and has 
attracted industry attention and collaboration.

INTRODUCTION 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) is one of the oldest grain legumes used for 
food and feed (Zohary & Hopf 1993). Evidence of lentil seed consumption 
dates back to 9000 BC in the Near East (Saver 1994) when farmer gatherers 
collected seed from the progenitor Lens culinaris ssp. orientalis (Boiss) Handel-
Mazzeti. By 6000 BC lentil had been domesticated as a cultivated crop and 
has been found subsequently in nearly all the archaeological sites excavated 
to date (Zohary & Hopf 1993). 
The modern crop is a compact [typically between 25 and 40 cm tall (Saxena 
& Hawtin 1981 )], slender and botanically indeterminate annual. Branch 
production is plastic depending on population density (Wilson & Teare 1972), 
genotype and environment. Detailed descriptions of plant and flower 
structure are given in Muehlbauer et al. (1995) and Summerfield, Muehlbauer 
and Roberts (1985). 
1. 1 LENTIL SEED COMPOSITION 
As with other grain legumes, lentil seeds are a rich source of dietary protein 
and carbohydrate (Table 1.1). Seeds have relatively small concentrations of 
the sulphur amino acids methionine and cystine (Table 1.2) and relatively 
large concentrations of lysine. Eaten in conjunction with cereals (which are 
lysine deficient) the mixed diet provides a good quality source of protein with 
well balanced essential amino acids (FAO 1982). The protein is one of the 
most readily digestible of all grain legumes (Table 1.3) and contains relatively 
small amounts of anti-nutritional factors (Adsule 1996). Lentils are also a good 
dietary source of iron, zinc and magnesium (Table 1.4).

Recent food safety scares such as the BSE crisis in beef, combined with an 
increasing interest in diet and with general concerns about health has lead to 
a 30% reduction in per capita meat consumption in the UK since 1980 
(Figure 1.1). Recent surveys (e.g. Gallup REALEAT 1999) reveal that 5 - 10% 
of the UK population claim to be vegetarian. These factors, coupled with 
increased sales of ethnic foods, has stimulated demand for non-animal protein 
sources - a market for which grain legumes in general, and lentil in particular 
are ideal candidates.

1.2 MARKET DEMAND 
Present figures indicate that the value of lentil imports to the UK exceeds 5 
million per annum (HM Customs & Excise, 1996) whilst total EU imports 
exceed 60 million per annum (FAOSTAT, 1999). The major lentil producing 
countries (Table 1.5) include India, Bangladesh, China, Iran and Pakistan. 
However, production in these countries hardly satisfies domestic demands. 
The major lentil exporting countries are Turkey, Canada and the USA. Imports 
of lentils to EU countries from extra-EU sources in 1996 exceeded 1 70 
thousand tonnes (Table 1.6) compared to 96 thousand tonnes in 1989 (UNIP 
1998). Of the 1996 import figure, approximately 98, 29 and 30 thousand 
tonnes were from Canada, Turkey and the USA, respectively.

The UK is the largest European consumer of Turkish lentils (Table 1.6), which 
tend to be small, decorticated, with split orange cotyledons. Other European 
countries have a preference for larger whole green lentils such as those 
produced in and exported from North America (Table 1.6). There is a 
demand in the UK for premium lentil types such as the small bottle-green 
whole lentils produced in the Puy region of France and the large grey-greens 
produced in Italy - which typically retail for about 10 kg-' compared to 
1.60 kg-' for red split lentil. Spain is historically and currently the principal 
consumer and producer of lentils in the EU. In 1996, the total imports of lentil 
into Spain exceeded 57 thousand tonnes (Table 1.6) compared with the 30 
thousand tonnes imported into France (the second largest consumer). 
1.3 PREVIOUS RESEARCH ON LENTIL AS A UK CROP 
Research at Reading during the 1980's (Stone 1991) investigated the 
adaptation of spring-sown crops of chickpea and lentil to the UK. The 
research spanned some very wet summers and two major constraints were 
encountered: foliar diseases and late harvest maturity. Both factors led to 
poor quality seed which would have been unsaleable. The crops did not 
begin to ripen until September, by which time the weather was wet and cool, 
which prolonged vegetative growth and delayed seed maturation. Seed yields 
were also small compared with the UK pea and faba bean crops (3.64 and 
3.84 t ha", respectively, in 1986 [MAFF 1987]). That said, in comparison with 
world average yields the lentil performed well (Table 1.7).

1.4 WINTER SOWING OF ANNUAL CROPS IN UK 
The identification and availability of cultivars with some degree of cold 
tolerance has allowed the introduction of crops into new areas, for example 
the cultivation of lupin (Lupinus a/bus L.) in England (Milford & Huyghe 1996). 
Not only do cold-tolerant genotypes allow specific cropS to be grown more 
widely, but they also allow the adoption of winter sowing as an alternative to 
sowing in spring. There are several advantages to winter sowing when 
compared to traditional spring sowings, including improved yields (Steponkus 
1978), earlier harvest date and reduced soil erosion. Silim, Saxena and Erskine 
(1991) reported that in Northern Syria during the 1984-85 season, seed yield 
of lentil was doubled by sowing in November compared to sowing in 
February. Averaged over three years there were overall increases of 22%_ and 
68% in seed and straw yield, respectively. 
Interest in the winter sowing of grain legumes is gaining momentum. Pea has 
been trialled as a winter crop for over 20 years and there are now two 
autumn-sown cultivars on the National Institute of Agricultural Botany (NIAB) 
recommended lists for use in the UK (NIAB 1999a). Winter-sown faba bean 
has been listed in the NIAB recommended lists since 1986, and there are 
now four recommended cultivars for use in the UK (NIAB 1999a). 
1.5 ALTERNATIVE CROP PRODUCTION SYSTEMS 
Poor seed yields [0.6 to 1.3 t ha-1 (FAO 1999)] limit the popularity of the lentil 
crop, especially in developed countries. In comparison with pea and faba 
bean (3.7 and 1.7 t ha-1 respectively in the EU) yields are unattractive. Poor 
yields are due partly to the use in traditional growing regions of genotypes 
which are little more than land-races (Whitehead et al. 1998). It is only during 
the past two decades that there has been a keen focus on the genetic 
improvement of the crop which has included the coming into being of well 
developed national and international breeding programmes. 
The yield gain from winter-sowing is to reflect the longer growing season. The 
crop is able to resume vegetative growth in early spring so that maximum leaf 
area index (LAI) is achieved at the time when irradiance receipts are also 
close to maximum values (Whitehead et al. 1998). Spring-sown crops cover 
the ground more slowly and so do not utilise radiation in spring and early 
summer to maximum benefit (Whitehead et al. 1998). Other advantages of 
sowing in winter include earlier harvest maturity and reduced likelihood of 
late season drought and/or heat stress (Keatinge, Qi & Kusmenoglu 1995). 
Disadvantages of sowing in winter include the possibilities that crops will 
suffer increased weed pressure (Sakar, Durutan & Meyveci 1988) and 
increased susceptibility to pathogens, such as Aschochyta blight (Aschochyta 
lentis) (Murray et al. 1988; Erskine & Muehlbauer 1995), which are favoured 
by cool and wet weather. 
Research in 1979-80 at the International Centre for Agricultural Research in 
the Dry Areas (ICARDA) (Erskine et al. 1981) identified 238 out of 3592 lentil 
accessions tested in a field experiment at Ankara, Turkey as cold-tolerant. 
Hamdi, Kusmenoglu and Erskine (1996) evaluated 245 accessions of wild 
lentil and 10 of cultivated lentil and found great variation in cold tolerance 
and winter survival which they quantified by the percentage of surviving 
plants and also by visual rating of plant damage in spring. Accessions from 
higher altitudes were in general more winter hardy than those from lower 
altitudes. It is the expanding interest in temperate regions, combined with the 
progressive adoption of winter sowing in West Asia and North Africa which is 
leading to an increasing number of genotypes being identified for the inter-
related criteria of cold tolerance and improved disease resistance. These 
genotypes require further selection for phenological adaptation to the 
different growing conditions of winter-sowing, such as timely flowering to 
avoid late-spring frosts and drought stress in summer (Keatinge et al. 1996). 
1.6 WINTER SOWING IN TURKEY 
In the early 1990's Turkish production of lentil was threatened by a plan to 
irrigate the Anatolian Plains in the southern part of the country. The result of 
the irrigation project would be to allow the widespread growth of 
economically valuable cash crops such as cotton (Gossypium hirsutum l.) and 
wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) at the expense of red lentil production (Keatinge 
et al. 1995). In an attempt to sustain national production, a joint research 
project between the Turkish Central Research Institute for Field Crops 
(CRIFC), ICARDA and The University of Reading investigated the possibility of 
moving lentil production to the highlands of central and eastern Anatolia. In 
those regions green lentil had traditionally been grown as a spring crop of 
minor importance (Keatinge et al. 1995) and, given the constraints of the 
short growing season 100 days), had an inherently small yield potential. The 
shifting of lentil production to an autumn-sowing cropping system required 
the identification of genotypes which had marketable traits and appropriate 
adaptation to winter. 
As will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 2 (pp. 27 - 38), three agro-
ecological zones were identified at different altitudes. The climates of those 
regions were characterised from 40 year runs of daily meteorological records 
(Keatinge et al. 1995) in order to identify "windows of opportunity" for safe 
sowing and safe flowering at the different locations. The use of a model 
predicting flowering time based upon photoperiod and temperature 
experienced during the vegetative period (Summerfield et al. 1985) then 
identified genotypes which were phenologically well adapted to the differing 
climatic regimes (Keatinge et al. 1996). The identification of potentially 
suitable genotypes through phenology-climate modelling removed the need 
for time-consuming field testing of all genotypes previously identified as cold-
tolerant. The outcome of this research provided the basis for the breeding 
and I or selection of genotypes with the requisite phenological adaptation 
and of marketable seed quality in a more reliable and resource efficient 
manner than would have been possible based on extensive and repeated 
field-testing. 
1.7 COLD TOLERANCE IN VASCULAR PLANTS 
Plants are commonly exposed to environmental conditions which are sub-
optimal for growth and survival. They may receive too little or too much rain, 
insufficient irradiance (or even excessive irradiance at cool temperatures) or 
the temperature may be sub- or supra-optimal. Notwithstanding these less 
than ideal conditions, plants will often survive and grow relatively well. 
In temperate regions, it is episodes of extreme cold, frosts, and generally cool 
temperatures which are major constraints to crop growth, survival and 
ultimate seed yield. Many annual crops sown in early spring are prone to late-
spring frost damage which may be reversible or may reduce the ultimate yield 
of the crop in that year. Similarly, early frosts in the autumn may damage fruit 
crops such as apples (Malus domestica) and thus make the harvest 
unprofitable (Lyons 1973). It is seldom cold alone which cause plant mortality 
overwinter, more often than not it is the interaction of cold with 
waterlogging, desiccating winds and / or disease which affects the survival of 
plants. 
1.7. 1 V ARIA TlON IN COLD TOLERANCE 
Many plants have the ability to withstand very harsh winters and are able to 
survive in very cold environments. 
Arctic plants must withstand very cold temperatures and often need to 
endure ice encasement which can trigger other problems such as anoxia. 
Crawford, Chapman and Hodge (1994) describe how populations of Poa 
alpina growing in Spitsbergen, Norway need to survive being covered in 
snow and encased in ice for up to eight months of the year. Populations of 
the same species from different locations exhibit varying degrees of cold 
tolerance. 
High mountain and arctic vegetation represent the extremes of tolerance to 
cold temperatures. Crop plants however, also show variance in cold 
tolerance, with large inter- and intra-specific differences (Sellschop & Salmon 
1928; Thomas & Sprent 1984 a, b). Sellschop and Salmon (1928) investigated 
the responses of 19 species of crop plants (30 cultivars) to cold temperatures 
and found that, as expected, plants which are staple crops of the sub-tropics 
were the most sensitive to freezing, e.g. cotton, rice (Oryza spp.), and 
groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.). The most hardy species were essentially the 
northern annuals including buckwheat (Fagopyrum escu/entum Moench) and 
flax (Unum usitatissimum L.). 
Thomas and Sprent (1984a) studied the effects of cold temperature on the 
growth of cold-tolerant and cold-sensitive genotypes of common bean. 
Genotypes varied in their ability to nodulate and expand leaves in cold 
conditions. In their subsequent investigations (1984b) they found that the rate 
of nitrogen translocation in the xylem was greater in the cold-tolerant 
genotype and they postulated that this feature in conjunction with the greater 
rate of nitrogen assimilation resulted in the greater rate of leaf expansion. 
1.7.2 COLD AND FREEZING DAMAGE TO PLANTS 
Winter stresses in temperate regions can be exacerbated by desiccating 
winds. These stresses can injure plants which are not cold-tolerant or have 
not had time to acclimate (i.e. to develop suitable protective mechanisms; 
Steponkus 1978; Christiansen & St. John 1981). There is little published 
information on the mechanisms invoked by grain legumes in response to cold 
(Murray et al. 1988; \ Very, Turc and LeCoeur 1993). 
There are often physical manifestations of chilling injury: necrotic patches on 
leaves, wilting of leaves or of entire plants, leaf lesions and surface pitting 
which can allow the entry of fungal pathogens (Lyons 1973). The key cellular 
component affected by chilling is the cell membrane. In chilling-sensitive 
plants such as tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) the phospholipid fraction of the 
membrane is composed of many saturated fatty acids (Nishida & Murata 
1996). At cold temperatures 5C), these phospholipids undergo a phase 
transition from the liquid crystalline state to a solid gel state. This change has 
several consequences on the subsequent functioning of the plant due to the 
important role the cell membrane plays in the normal metabolic functioning 
of cells. 
7.7.3 ENZYME FUNCTION 
Many enzymes important III biochemical pathways are membrane-bound 
(Lyons, Raison & Steponkus 1979), and so the alteration of the membrane 
structure as caused by a cold-induced phase transition interferes with their 
normal functioning and so the normal metabolism of the plant is disrupted 
{Nishida & Murata 1996}. The inactivation of enzymes can disrupt 
photosynthesis and respiration (Guy 1990). For example, the thylakoid 
membranes of chloroplasts in chilling-sensitive species are very sensitive to 
damage by cold temperatures (Nishida & Murata 1996). 
Many enzymes involved in metabolic processes other than photosynthesis 
are also affected by cool temperatures and their reduced activity can lead to 
the accumulation of toxins (Lyons et al. 1979). An example is when the 
enzymes involved in aerobic respiration are unable to function properly, such 
that anaerobic respiration becomes the energy-producing pathway for the 
cell and so ethanol, pyruvate and acetaldehyde then accumulate. These 
compounds are toxic to the cell at high concentrations and, because the 
enzymes which ordinarily catabolise them are unable to function adequately, 
the cells die (Lyons et al. 1979; Andrews 1996). Nothing is known about 
these sorts of biochemical responses in cold-stressed lentil. 
1.7.4 TRANSPORT PROTEINS 
The lipid phase transition following cold stress also causes conformational 
change to other structural proteins and so cell membranes become more 
permeable to ions such as K+ (Christiansen & 5t. John 1981). Cells frequently 
become leaky and ionic imbalances occur. Ionic imbalances interfere with 
normal cellular functioning and can cause cell death. There are no published 
experiments looking at ion leakage in cold-stressed lentil. 
1.7.5 PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND PHOTOINHIBITION 
The combination of high light intensity with cold temperatures can inhibit 
photosynthesis - a process known as photoinhibition (Powles (1984); Long, 
Humphries & Falkowski 1994; Kaye & Guy 1995). Photoinhibition is 
characterised by a decline in rates of CO2 uptake, changes in chlorophylla 
fluorescence characteristics, and a decline in the yield of photosynthetic CO2-
dependent O2 evolution (Long et al. 1994). The metabolic disruption caused 
by these changes can injure or even kill plants, but declines in photosynthetic 
activity can be reversed on a return to warmer temperatures. Nothing is 
known about photoinhibition in lentil, although anthocyanin pigmentation is 
seen to occur in response to cold and, as will be discussed in a later section, 
is associated with a photoprotective role. 
1.7.6 ACCLlMATlON 
Plants use many mechanisms in order to survive the rigours of winter. 
Different species use different combinations of survival mechanisms. In 
general, plants gain maximum cold hardiness through acclimation (hardening) 
(Levitt, 1980). During autumn as the temperature cools Cold regulated (cor) 
genes are activated and trigger the process of acclimation (Thomashow 1993; 
Kaye & Guy 1995). This process typically takes several weeks until the plant is 
fully hardy and has maximum cold tolerance. Some of the different 
mechanisms by which plants survive low, freezing temperatures will now be 
described. The mechanisms evoked during acclimation include biochemical, 
sub-cellular, anatomical and structural changes. 
1.7.6.1 Antifreeze proteins 
Guy (1990) proposed that proteins produced in response to cold acclimation 
were probably cryoprotective. Griffith et al. (1992) showed that one set of 
these proteins were expressed in the leaves of cold-acclimated rye (Seca/e 
cereale L.) plants they described as anti-freeze proteins. Anti-freeze proteins 
act to reduce the freezing point of cellular solutions relatively more than their 
effect on reducing the melting point of ice crystals. 
The modification of the formation of ice crystals is thought to promote winter 
survival in rye by decreasing the rate of ice formation and also by preventing 
small ice crystals from forming into larger ones (Hon et al. 1994). The 
presence of anti-freeze proteins has also been demonstrated in wheat, barley, 
oats, kale (Brassica o/eraceae L.) and winter oil seed rape (Brassica napus L.) 
(Antikainen & Griffith 1997). 
In cold-tolerant monocotyledons such as rye, freezing tolerance is strongly 
correlated with the presence of antifreeze proteins (Antikainen & Griffith 
1997) following cold acclimation. In non-acclimated cereals and in maize 
(lea mays L.) no antifreeze activity has been detected even following 
exposure to cool temperatures. Where antifreeze activity has been detected 
in dicotyledons, there is no correlation between their presence and freezing 
tolerance (Antikainen & Griffith 1997). For example, spinach (Brassica 
o/eraceae L.) is freezing-tolerant but the protein that accumulated in response 
to cold-temperature treatment did not show any antifreeze activity 
(Antikainen & Griffith 1997). No studies have been published regarding the 
presence of antifreeze proteins in lentil. 
1.7.6.2 Cryoprotective proteins 
In addition to the synthesis of proteins showing antifreeze activity, other 
proteins are produced in response to cold temperature acclimation 
(Thomashow 1993). These proteins and various genes expressed during cold-
temperature exposure have been identified as being members of the late 
embryogenesis abundant (LEA) and / or the dehydrin families (Kaye & Guy 
1995). 
The LEA genes are expressed when seeds desiccate to low water content, 
whilst dehydrin genes are expressed during periods of water stress. It has long 
been recognised that freezing is an extremely desiccative process (Levitt, 
1980) and so it is not improbable that proteins involved in plant responses to 
water stress should also play an important role in freezing tolerance. Some of 
these proteins have a cryoprotective role. For example, in Arabidopsis 
thaliana L. a protein has been identified which is able to protect the freeze-
sensitive enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from inactivation in a freeze-
thaw cycle (Un & Thomashow 1992). Further work revealed that a protein 
with the same protective ability was synthesised by cold-acclimated spinach 
(Kaye & Guy 1995). By protecting LDH from freeze inactivation plants are 
able to prevent the build up of toxic compounds and are therefore able to 
better survive the anaerobic conditions experienced during freezing. No work 
of this type has been reported for lentil. 
1.7.6.3 Sugar accumulation 
There is during acclimation also an increase in the concentrations of sugars 
(notably sucrose and trisaccharides) in the acclimating plant cells (Antikainen 
& Pihakaski 1994). One hypothesis is that increase in sugar concentration 
increases cold tolerance by altering the osmotic potential of the cell. This 
osmotic adjustment then is thought to increase Abscisic Acid (ABA) 
concentration which in turn induces protein synthesis. The induction of 
protein synthesis is demonstrated by increased RNA concentration and the 
expression of many polypeptides in the acclimating cells (Antikainen & 
Pihakski 1994). Murray et al. (1988) cite work which demonstrated that 
concentrations of ABA were greater in winter genotypes of faba bean 
compared to spring genotypes, even when grown under the same 
acclimating conditions. Heino et al. (1990) found that ABA-deficient mutants 
of Arabidopsis lost their ability to acclimate to cold and had the same cold 
tolerance as non-acclimated wild type plants. 
Many compounds increase in concentration during acclimation and are 
known as compatible solutes. Compatible solutes are not normally present at 
an increased concentration but when accumulated they are not toxic to the 
cell. These include betaine in cold acC\imating cereals (Kishitani et a/.1994) 
which has been correlated with increased freezing tolerance and the amino 
acid proline which has been shown to accumulate in acclimating wheat 
plants (Kaye & Guy 1995). The compatible solutes may act to stabilise 
enzymes during the dehydration events that occur during freezing (Kaye & 
Guy 1995}. Nothing is known of changes in sugar concentrations in cold-
stressed lentil. 
7.7.6.4 Membrane lipid composition 
Rye plants (Uemura & Steponkus 1997) are able to alter their membrane lipid 
composition by increasing the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in order 
to maintain membrane fluidity at cooler temperatures (Kaye & Guy 1995; 
Nishida & Murata 1996). The alteration in lipid composition then enables the 
plant to function normally as enzyme activity and membrane permeability is 
not affected by conformational changes. There is no published research on 
membrane lipid composition in lentil and subsequent alterations in relation to 
cold treatment. 
7.7.6.5 Anthocyanin pigmentation 
Anthocyanins are often seen in hardened plants under conditions of cold 
stress where they become evident as a red pigmentation. In ivy (Hedera helix 
L.) anthocyanins are produced during cold acclimation and then decline 
during spring (Parker 1962). Parker also detected a marked increase in 
anthocyanin concentration during March, which coincided with increase in 
solar irradiance under conditions of cold temperatures. This supports the 
hypothesis that anthocyanins act as a protective pigment for chloroplasts and 
reduce the likelihood of photoinhibition. Studies in Jack pine (Pinus banksia 
Lamb.) have also shown a positive correlation between resistance to 
photoinhibition and anthocyanin accumulation in epidermal cells (Huner et al. 
1993). 
Work by Christie et al. (1994) demonstrated that in maize seedlings 
anthocyanin synthesis was controlled by cor genes. Leyva et al. (1995) found 
that a cold inducible gene in wheat was only expressed in photosynthetically 
active tissue and led to the production of anthocyanins, further supporting 
the hypothesis that anthocyanins reduce the risk of photoinhibition. Lentil has 
been observed to accumulate anthocyanin pigmentation during cold stress. 
There are no published reports of a correlation between anthocyanin 
accumulation and resistance to photoinhibition in lentil. 
7.7.6.6 Plant structure and morphology 
Pihakaski-Maunsbach et al. (1996) found that during cold acclimation of rye, 
the leaf cuticle thickened (as did the cell walls of epidermal cells) and the 
number of stomata declined. He hypothesised that these changes were a 
defence mechanism to reduce the susceptibility of plants to fungal disease. 
Plant morphology is affected during hardening and is typically shown by a 
compact and rosette-like growth habit (Roberts 1984), e.g. in wheat, rye and 
spinach (Gray et al. 1997). It is likely that this growth habit is advantageous in 
that it increases plant temperature by altering the immediate microclimate, as 
with the structure of arctic cushion plants which enables leaf temperature to 
be as much as 1 aoe warmer than the surrounding air (Jones 1983). The most 
winter-hardy pea plants are said to branch freely at ground-level and the most 
cold-tolerant chickpea genotypes exhibit a prostrate growth habit (Malhotra & 
Saxena 1993). There are no published studies indicating this to be the case in 
winter-lentil. 
There are, then, many mechanisms adopted by plants in order to survive cold. 
Not every mechanism is evoked by every plant and work is continuing to 
elucidate the mechanisms used by different species. Little work has been 
done with regard to the methods evoked by any grain legume, and lentil in 
particular, in response to cold. 
1.8 ROTATIONAL BENEFITS 
Following the inclusion of forage or grain legumes in crop-rotations with 
cereals there can be an increase in soil nitrogen status when compared to 
cereal/cereal and non-legume/cereal rotations. For example, Scholefield and 
Smith (1996) describe experiments which used clover (Trifolium spp.) as a ley 
crop and found that up to 180 kg N ha'1 could be accumulated per annum 
compared to 70 kg N ha'1 without clover in the rotation. Similarly, Cormack 
(1996) found that growing red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) cv. Merviot in 
rotation with winter wheat increased cereal yield and grain nitrogen 
concentration compared to other clover cultivars and grass/clover mixtures. 
Johnson and Goodlass (1996) have reported that the mineral nitrogen 
concentration of the soil was improved following vining pea far more than 
after potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.). This 'carry-over' can therefore lessen 
the inorganic nitrogen requirement for the subsequent wheat crop [The 
'carry-over' of nitrogen will be discussed further as an introduction to Chapter 
6 (pp. 110 - 144), as will be other rotational benefits including the reduction 
of disease pressures in subsequent cereal crops]. 
Winter sowing of lentil leads to earlier harvest of mature seeds which would 
allow for the more efficient use of farm labour during the summer months. A 
UK lentil crop harvested in July would not interfere with the August harvest of 
wheat, whilst sowing in October would not interfere with the sowing of 
winter wheat in September nor with the sowing of winter barley (Hordeum 
vu/gare L.) or oil seed rape (Brassica napus L.) which may take place during 
August. 
The published literature contains very few articles on the strategies used by 
lentil to tolerate cold, however the lentil is known to be one of the most cold 
tolerant of all grain legumes. In this regard, winter-sown lentil appears to have 
considerable potential for UK cropping and coupled with potential rotational 
benefits there is a case for investigating the crops' potential. 
1.9 RESEARCH PROGRAMME 
Since the programme of research carried out by Stone (1991) in 1986 to 
1987, winter-hardy lentil genotypes have been successfully grown in both 
unreplicated and replicated experimental field plots at Sonning-on-Thames 
(see Chapter 2). Winter-sown lentil matured during late-July and seed yields 
were greater than those achieved with spring-sowings - typically 170 and 140 
g m-2, respectively. 
Given the market demand for lentil in the EU, the shortage of protein crops in 
the EU for food, availability of lentil genotypes adapted for winter-sowing and 
farmers' increased interest in crop rotations for environmental benefit, it is 
timely to investigate winter-sowing of lentil in the UK. Several areas needed 
to be addressed: the characterisation of the "winter" experienced at the 
experimental site (Chapter 2); the identification of suitable genotypes for use 
in the experimental programme (Chapters 2 and 4); the effect of population 
density on plant survival over-winter, and the effect of population density on 
seed yield (Chapter 3); the stability of genotype performance (seed yield) at 
different UK locations (Chapter 4); the feasibility of mechanical harvesting 
using standard agricultural machinery (Chapter 5); and the rotational effect of 
a lentil crop on a subsequent cereal crop (Chapter 6). Furthermore, with data 
available from three years of field research, at least tentative assessments as 
to the economics of lentil production and the likely effect of changes to the 
Common Agricultural Policy on UK lentil crops can be made and are 
discussed in Chapter 7. The progress made by the research is discussed in an 
overarching Chapter 8. 
The general hypothesis is that cold hardy genotypes of lentil selected for 
study based on experience elsewhere can survive winter in UK, come into 
flower after the danger of spring frost is past and then mature in July (and so 
not compete with other cereal based farm demands) to produce 
economically attractive yields of good quality seeds, with beneficial carry-over 
effects to a subsequent crop of wheat. 
CHAPTER 2-
RESEARCH FRAMEWORK: GENOTYPES, LOCATION AND 
WEATHER 
2. 1 GENOTYPES CHOSEN FOR RESEARCH 
There are many genotypes of lentil which have at least some cold tolerance, 
and therefore have the potential to be grown as a winter-sown crop in the 
UK. In 1996, the Crops Research Unit at Sonning had seed of 24 such 
genotypes in cold storage at 4C which could be included in the initial 
experiments of this research programme. They had been sown at Sonning in 
1995-96 in single row trials, each 4 m long with seeds spaced 5 cm apart 
within-rows and rows spaced 25 cm apart, with a cold-susceptible control (ILL 
2580) planted every third row (N.O. Smith, pers. comm. 1999). The trial was 
hand-sown on 15 October 1995. Weeds were also controlled by hand. 
Information on winter-survival, seed yield, seed size and colour from that trial 
(Table 2.1), together with seed availability were used to select 12 genotypes 
for further research. They were chosen to cover a range of seed sizes, 
colours, yields and countries of origin, but with a greater proportion that were 
better yielding with greater yield stability across years. In addition the 
potential marketability of the produce was also considered. The traditionally 
spring-sown French cv. Lentille de Puy was also included given its success 
abroad.

Genotypes with the prefix ILL (International Legume Lentil) are from the 
ICARDA lentil germplasm collection in Syria which consists mainly of 
landraces, breeders' selections and a small number of cultivars. The seed was 
originally supplied to The University of Reading by Or W Erskine in 1995. 
Genotypes with the WA and WH prefix are from Washington State 
University, USA. The majority of that material was bred by Dr F J Muehlbauer 
who supplied the genotypes to The University in 1995. 
Cultivar Lentille de Puy was originally supplied in 1989 by J.K. King and Sons 
(Neasden, UK). It is of French origin and is covered by the" Appelation 
Controlee" regulations. Under these regulations, the produce of the plant can 
only be sold as "Lentille du Puy" when grown in the Puy region of France, 
otherwise it must be referred to as a "Puy-type". 
2.2 SITE DESCRIPTION 
With the exception of five sites away from Reading used in the 1997-98 and 
1998-99 Genotype x Environment experiments (Chapter 4), all experiments 
were conducted at the Crops Research Unit at Sonning. The experimental site 
(Woodlands) is located on Sonning Farm (51 0 29' N, 00 54' W) 0.4 km south 
of the River Thames. It is surrounded by woodland on three sides. The site is 
managed on a four-year rotation where experiments are conducted in year 1, 
they are then followed by a maize crop in year 2 and then placed under grass 
(Lolium perenne L.) for years 3 and 4. In this way the effects of previous 
experimental treatments are minimised for subsequent experiments in year 5. 
Maize is included in the rotation to reduce weed seed pressure and to 
remove differences in soil moisture between treatments, whilst the grass ley 
minimises differences in fertility caused by the previous experimental 
treatments and is also included to increase soil organic matter (Tivy 1990). 
Unless stated otherwise, all experiments were protected from bird attack at 
emergence and during crop maturation by covering with black fruit 
protection netting (mesh size 2cm) supported on a galvanised frame 2m high. 
The netting remained in place until after seed harvest. 
The free-draining soil is a coarse sandy loam of the Rowland series (Kay 1936) 
overlying gravel. The pH and nutrient status of the soil is assessed each year 
during late summer to allow the application of P, K and Mg fertilisers so that 
these nutrients are non-limiting for plant growth (Table 2.2). The soil is very 
poor in organic matter. In the present programme of research no nitrogenous 
fertiliser was applied to any of the experiments with the exception of the oat 
crop in the rotation experiment (Chapter 6).

2.3 WEATHER 
One of the traditional major exporters of lentil is Turkey, which has until 
recently produced most of the national crop on the Anatolian plains. In the 
early 1990's a plan to irrigate the plains of south-eastern Anatolia (GAP) was 
introduced. The likely result of the implementation of the GAP scheme would 
be to allow the production of more profitable cash-crops and cause a 
subsequent reduction of lentil production, perhaps by as much as 60% 
(Bayaner, Uzunlu & Kusmenoglu 1995). In an attempt to compensate for the 
loss of this growing region, the Central Research Institute of Field Crops 
(CRIFC) of Turkey in association with ICARDA and The University of Reading 
investigated the possibility of winter-sowing in the highlands of Anatolia. The 
first objective was to identify safe "windows of opportunity" for sowing, 
germination and flowering at three highland sites which represented the three 
major agro-ecological zones of the region (Keatinge et al. 1995). The 
"windows of opportunity" were determined by a start and end date during 
which a specific phenological event could take place safely. 
The window for safe sowing was delineated by two conditions: adequate 
rainfall to allow germination and a warm enough average air temperature to 
allow seed germination and seedling emergence to occur prior to a frost 
event. The work predicted the first safe date of germination to be the date on 
which the probability of 15mm of rain being received within a five-day period 
after 1 September exceeded 0.5 (from 40 years of continuous, daily 
meteorological records). The last safe date for germination was predicted as 
the first date on which the probability of the average temperature falling 
below 4C exceeded 0.1. 
The conditions for the window for safe flowering were the avoidance of frost 
events at flowering and secondly, ensuring adequate rainfall at flowering to 
reduce drought stress during pod filling. The first safe date for flowering was 
thus predicted to be the date of the last frost recorded in the 40 years of 
meteorological data. The last safe date for flowering was defined as the day 
on which the weekly probability of rain occurring first falls below 0.25. 
With these definitions in mind, the climate experienced at Sonning was 
characterised using a 27-year dataset (1970 - 1996). 
2.3.1 Safe window of opportunity for sowing 
Since the UK experiences a maritime climate with rainfall being received all 
year round (Figure 2.1), it was deemed that there would be adequate soil 
moisture for seed germination throughout the autumn and hence there would 
be no need to set a condition for minimum rainfall. The latest date for safe 
sowing is the first day in autumn that the probability of mean air temperature 
falling below 4 C exceeds 0.1. On this criterion the latest date by which lentil 
should be sown is 30 October (Figure 2.2). This estimate confirms the 
previous subjective practice at Sonning in which lentil has been sown during 
the first half of October. 
2.3.2 Safe window of opportunity for flowering 
Keatinge et al. (1995) defined the earliest safe date for flowering to be the 
same as the last day in spring with a recorded frost. However frost events at 
Sonning have been recorded in every month of the year at least once during 
the 27-year meteorological database. The first safe date for flowering was 
therefore taken to be the last day in spring when the probability of mean air 
temperature dropping below 4 C is reduced to zero, i.e. 4 May (Figure 2.3). 
The last safe date for flowering using the definition of Keatinge et al. (1995) is 
not appropriate given that rain can be expected throughout the season 
(Figure 2.1). It is worth noting that provided first flowering occurred after 22 
April, there is little chance that the plants would experience frost (Figure 2.3).

Figure 2.3 The probability of daily mean air temperature exceeding 4C at Sonning,

for flowering, namely 4 May 
expected drought, that date should ideally be such that the resultant seed 
harvest does not extend much into August as the weather is less reliable and 
the prospect of a wet harvest is more likely. In addition, a harvest in August 
would result in a conflict with the cereal harvest for farmers. The probability 
of rain is lowest at the start of September (Figure 2.1) which suggests that this 
would be the ideal time for harvest. In fact the most suitable time for harvest 
is between the end of July and the middle of August when temperatures are 
warmest (Figures 2.4 and 2.5) and evaporation is at a maximum leading to 
rapid crop desiccation at the end of seed filling. 
2.3.3 1996-97 Weather 
November was 101C cooler than the long-term average (Figure 2.4), with a 
rainfall receipt 33mm above-average (Figure 2.6). Rainfall was erratic, with 5 
days which each received more than 10mm. December was colder than 
average by 1.7C but considerably drier. January 1997 continued this trend, 
being 2.3C cooler than the long-term average and receiving only one quarter 
of the average rainfall. February reversed this trend and was 2.3C warmer 
than average and received 166% of the average rainfall total. March was 
2.3C warmer but received only one quarter of the total rainfall average. April 
was again warmer than average (by 1.2C) and much drier (just 31 % of the 
average rainfall was received). The fact that flowering was recorded in some 
plots on 23 April is likely to have been due to the relatively warm weather 
experienced during the previous months. The weather in May and June 
continued to be warmer than the long-term mean. However whilst May

Overall the growing season (November to July) was just 0.20 C warmer than 
the long-term average, but 161 mm (30%) drier than normal. Moreover, the 
rain that was received fell at times during the season that were not 
advantageous to crop production and the UK arable sector as a whole 
suffered from the wet summer (Farmers Weekly, May - July 1997). The 
winter was relatively mild (Figure 2.4) and could not be described as harsh. 
Early spring was warm and much drier than average, which led to early 
flowering and pod-set. The weather became wet and humid at the beginning 
of June which caused disease problems in many crops throughout the 
country (Farmers Weekly, June 1997).

half of the month were warmer than average but then dropped in the latter 
half of the month (Figure 2.5), while rainfall was below that expected (Figure 
2.6). November was a wet month, 19% more rain than expected was 
received. December was changeable, there were two cold spells in the early 
and middle parts of the month, but mean temperature was still 1.1 C warmer 
than average. January 1998 started out wet and stormy before becoming dry 
and cool as the month progressed. The mean temperature for the month was 
1.2e warmer than average and 23% more rainfall than the long-term 
average was received. The mean temperature in February was 2.4e warmer 
than average and only one tenth of the rainfall expected fell. March was 2C 
warmer than average and there was 10% less than the expected rainfall. April 
was very wet (over 108 mm of rain was received compared with the long 
term average of 44 mm), whilst the mean temperature was just above 
average for the month as a whole. May was warmer than normal (mean 
temperature was 2C above average) and only 31 % of the expected rainfall 
was received. The average temperature in June was about average, and there 
was 50 mm more rain than the long-term mean for the month. In addition, 
relative humidities were higher than normal which led to disease problems in 
many crops in the UK. July was 1C cooler than average. Whilst there were 
periods of very heavy rain in the middle of the month, as a whole only two-
thirds of the long-term mean rainfall was received. 
2.3.5 Comparison of winters 1996-97 and 1997-98 
The weather experienced during the winter of 1996-97 was not severe -
being O.7e cooler than the 27 year mean of 4.4e for the months 
November to February. Mean minimum temperature for the same period was 
also 0.8e cooler than the 27 year mean minimum of 1.9C. In contrast, the 
1997-98 winter was much warmer (Figure 2.5), such that the mean 
temperature for the months November to February was 1.6e warmer than 
the 27 year mean (and 2.3( warmer than the mean temperature for the 
1996-97 winter). The mean minimum temperature was 1.1C warmer than 
the 27 year mean minimum temperature of 1.9C. 
Apart from differences in temperature between the two seasons, there was 
also a difference in the amount and distribution of precipitation during the 
winter and spring months (Figure 2.6). Overall, the amount of rain that fell 
from October 1996 to February 1997 was 47.1 mm less than the average of 
293.5 mm. The two spring months of March and April 1997 were much drier 
than the 27 year average with only 26.4 mm of rain received compared to 
the average of 95.3 mm. The rainfall received from October 1997 to Feb 
1998 (250mm) was similar to that which fell in the same period in the 
previous season (246 mm). Unlike the 1996-97 season when most rain fell in 
November and February, in 1997-98 the rain fell consistently in the months 
October to January and was close to the average for each month. March and 
April 1998, however, were very wet (153 mm compared to the average of 
95.3 mm) and the plots suffered from waterlogging. The soil reached field 
capacity and large pools of water were seen on the plots for five days whilst 
the plants were at approximately growth stage V4. 
2.3.6 1998-99 Weather 
September was an unsettled month with a rainfall receipt 30mm (Figure 2.6) 
more than expected whilst the mean temperature was 1.9C warmer than the 
long term average (Figure 2.7). The mean temperature in October was 
average, whilst it was an extremely wet month (Figure 2.6) with 55mm more

rain than expected being received, and this prevented sowing from occurring 
during the month. The rainfall in November was average and the mean 
monthly temperature was 0.8( warmer than average. December was a 
warmer than average month (mean temperature was 1.2( above average) 
and 18% less rain than expected actually fell. January 1999 again was warmer 
than average (by 2.1C) and 35% more rain than expected was received. 
February was 1.3( warmer than the long term average, but drier than 
average (only 55% of the expected rain actually fell). March was again drier 
than average (41% of the expected rain being received) but warmer than the 
long term mean by 1.5(, although there were several frosts during the latter 
half of the month. April was warmer than average (by 1.6() whilst rainfall 
was about average for the month. May was 1.8( warmer than the long term 
mean and received 10% less than the expected rainfall. The mean 
temperature in June was average whilst 23.2 mm more rain than expected 
was received. There was 19% less rainfall than expected during July, and the 
mean temperature was about average. August was a wet month, a total of 
90mm of rain was received compared to the expected rainfall of 52mm, the 
mean air temperature for the month was the same as the 27 year average. 
CHAPTER 3-
EFFECT OF PLANT POPULATION DENSITY ON 
WINTER SURVIVAL AND SEED YIELD 
3. 1 INTRODUCTION 
This chapter reports three experiments conducted during 1996-97 and 1997-
98. The first and third experiments were designed to investigate the effect of 
plant population densities on winter survival and ultimate seed yield of 
autumn-sown lentil in the UK. The second experiment investigated the effect 
of plant population density on the seed yield of a spring-sown lentil crop. The 
experiment in 1997-98 was also designed to establish whether the response 
of winter survival and seed yield to plant population density was modified by 
sowing date. 
Research into the effect of population density on seed yield in UK spring-
sown lentil was conducted by Stone (1991) during the 1980's. The yields 
were variable (100 - 296 g m-2) due in the main to weather. Seed quality was 
also variable, due again to weather; one wet year was particularly favourable 
for the incidence of Botrytis fabae. The main conclusions of that research was 
that an increased stand density increased biological yield and hastened 
maturity, with a decline in harvest index. The optimum plant population was 
194 plants m-2 for maximum seed yield, and the relation of seed yield to plant 
population density was parabolic. 
Spring-sowing resulted in crops maturing during September which meant that 
weather conditions were not reliable for harvesting. A further disadvantage of 
spring-sowing is that the late harvest would conflict with the sowing of 
autumn-cereals. In contrast, it is hypothesised that autumn-sowing should lead 
to an earlier harvest date, which should not then conflict with the harvest of 
cereals. 
In order for an autumn-sown crop to survive over winter and go on to yield 
well, seedlings must be sufficiently hardy and then be able to grow vigorously 
in early spring. Winter-hardiness is a multi-faceted trait which encompasses 
molecular and biochemical aspects as well as physiological processes and 
physical and anatomical features (see Chapter 1). 
Winter-survival in lentil is improved by increased stand density. Dense stands 
of crops exhibit differences in for example, temperature and carbon dioxide 
concentrations above and within the canopy, due to the establishment over 
the canopy of a boundary layer of air (Saugier 1977). Microclimate profiles 
within a crop, such as those reproduced by Saugier (1977) for maize, millet 
(Panicum spp.) and grass, show differences in temperature above and within 
a crop canopy. These differences may be small, but may nevertheless be 
sufficient to improve survival. The so-called boundary layer is established due 
to the relative movement of air over the crop (Monteith 1973) - a greater 
plant density is more likely to form a thicker boundary layer than that over a 
sparse stand, where the air becomes more turbulent and so there is little 
difference in factors such as temperature within and above the crop canopy. 
Jones (1983) has described how reduced windspeed above the canopy can 
result in a significant rise in leaf temperature by as much as lODe above 
ambient air temperature. 
3. 1. 1 Disease resistance 
Winter-sown crops must also have suitable disease resistance, so that any 
physical or physiological winter damage would not leave them vulnerable to 
pathogens. The diseases most likely to affect winter-sown lentil in the UK are 
Aschochyta blight (if it were introduced through diseased seed), and Botrytis 
(caused by Botrytis cinerea) although this is not specific to winter-sowing. 
Aschochyta blight is increasingly troublesome on winter-sown lentil crops in 
Mediterranean regions due to cooler temperatures and higher humidities 
experienced during the growing season (Jimenez-Diaz, Porta-Puglia and Tivoli 
1998; Khare, Bayaa and Beniwal 1993). 
3.1.2 Optimum population 
The economics of crop production are such that the optimum population for 
factors such as maximum seed yield and maximum survival may not be the 
same as that which provides the maximum economic return. In this context, 
an important objective for the agronomist and farmer is to determine an 
optimum target population where risks are minimised and yields (or financial 
returns) are maximised. The experiments conducted in the two seasons were 
designed to quantify the optimum target population for winter-sown lentil 
crops in the UK. 
A knowledge of yield-density relations has long been recognised as important 
for maximising yield returns and many models have been developed by 
numerous workers. These were comprehensively reviewed by Willey and 
Heath (1969). Since this review there has been a general acceptance of the 
so-called reciprocal equations (Vandermeer 1984) as giving the best fit 
models to the majority of agricultural and horticultural crops. These equations 
can be applied to the whole biomass yield of a crop and also to the yield of a 
plant part (for example, seed or grain yield). Biomass yield is generally best 
described by an asymptotic curve, whilst the yield of a particular plant 
component tends to conform better to a parabolic relation. 
The parabolic relation was first described by the equation of Holliday (1960): 
l/w =a +Bp (1 ) 
Where w = yield per plant, p = population density, a and p are constants. 
Bleasdale and Nelder (1960) proposed an alternative equation to describe 
the parabolic relation: 
Where e and ~ are constants. Bleasdale & Thompson (1966) subsequently 
argued that experiments rarely gave reliable enough data to allow the 
calculation of both constants e and ~. Since the ratio of e to ~ is of most 
importance, then one of these two constants could be given a value of unity. 
Hence the introduction of Bleasdale's (1966a) Simplified Equation: 
w-6=a+Bp (3) 
Bleasdale put forward that in the case of total biomass yield, the curve would 
describe an asymptotic relation and hence e = 1. This resulted in an equation 
identical to that of Holliday (1960). Bleasdale's Simplified Equation can 
describe the yield response of a plant part (such as seed) to density through 
the use of a value of ep' This constant can be obtained as the slope of the 
regression line of log w versus log wp (where wp represents the yield per plant 
of the target component). If ep < 1 then it is an indication that harvest index 
changes with population density, whereas if ep = 1 then harvest index remains 
constant. 
In this chapter, the above equation is fitted to the lentil seed yield-population 
density data collected in the two seasons. The ultimate objective is to apply 
the results of the winter-survival investigation and yield-density relations in 
order to make recommendations for suitable target plant population densities 
for winter-sown lentil in the UK. 
3.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 
3.2.7 Experiment 7 (7996-97) 
A randomised block design with three replications was utilised for the 
experiment sown at the Crops Research Unit, Sonning, Berkshire (Figure 3.1). 
Two lentil genotypes were planted at each of five sowing rates, viz: 33, 66, 
130, 260 and 520 seeds m2, to give target populations of 25, 50, 100, 200 
and 400 plants m2 The overseeding of 30% was used to allow for non-
emergence and seedling mortality. The site has no known fertility gradients, 
and is relatively level which permitted the blocking design utilised (Figure 3.1) 
The genotypes were chosen on the basis of data on winter survival from 
previous trials at Sonning Farm (N.O. Smith, pers. comm. 1996). The 
information used for selection has been given in detail in Chapter 2 (pp. 26 -
38). Survival rate was taken to be the number of plants present on 22 March 
1996 compared to the number of established plants recorded on 30 
November 1995. Seed yield and quality (size, colour and uniformity) were 
also taken into account. 
Two genotypes were used as follows: 
 ILL 1878. A green-seeded genotype of Turkish origin with intermediate 
seed size. Hundred seed weight = 3.7g. In previous winter-sown field trials 
at Sonning (1995-6), this genotype had a 92% survival rate over winter 
and the seed dry weight yield was 2.9 t d.m. ha'1 (plot yield converted to 
equivalent field yield); and 
 ILL 780. A large green-seeded genotype, from Syria. Hundred seed weight 
= 7.5g. In previous winter field trials at Sonning (1995-6), the genotype 
had a 93% survival rate over the 1995-6 winter and the seed dry weight 
yield was 3.1 t d.m. ha'1 (plot yield converted to equivalent field yield). 
Plot size was 3 m long by 1.8 m wide. The distance between adjacent plots 
was 20 cm and the distance between extreme plot rows was 1.8m. The plots 
were sown using a Trialsmaster small-plot drill on 31 October 1996. Row 
width was 11 cm, which had previously been shown to optimise winter 
survival (N.O. Smith, unpublished results 1996). 
Weeds were controlled by regular hand-weeding throughout the spring and 
early-summer, as no chemical herbicide formulations were approved for use 
on lentil in UK. 
The first population count was made on 4 December 1996, and a second 
count was made on 26 March 1997. The number of plants in five, one-metre 
long drill rows were counted from the centre of each plot. These data were 
used to determine winter survival of the plants in each plot (26 March 1997 
count / 4 December 1996 count). The spring count was also taken to be the 
plant population density achieved for subsequent calculations of mean seed 
yield per plant. 
Plots were harvested when the plants were assessed to have reached Growth 
Stage R8 (Erskine et al. 1990). Genotype ILL 780 was harvested between 15 
and 24 July 1997 (258 - 267 DAS), and ILL 1878 between 20 and 28 July 
1997 (263 - 271 DAS). The central square metre of each plot was cut by 
hand at ground level and plants were placed in paper sacks for storage prior 
to threshing. Total biomass was weighed. Plants were threshed by hand. The 
majority of stems had been removed from the harvested sample. The 
remaining pods and stems were then rubbed together to open the pods, and 
a fan was used to remove stems, pods and dust from the seed fraction. The 
separate seed and haulm fractions were then weighed, and dry weights were 
determined for 10 samples each of 100g of seed and haulm after oven-drying 
at 80C for 48 h. 
plot was cut by hand at ground level and plants were placed into paper sacks 
for storage prior to threshing. Other experimental details are identical to 
those described for the winter-sown experiment. 
3.2.3 Experiment 3 (7997-98) 
A randomised block design was used for an investigation undertaken in 1997-
98 into the effect of plant population density on seed yield of lentil. Two 
sowing dates were used giving a total of 20 treatment combinations. The 
early sowing date was 14 October 1997 which fell within the "window of 
opportunity" predicted for safe autumn emergence. The second sowing date 
was 31 October 1997 which fell just outside that "window of opportunity" 
(see Chapter 2), but which matched the 1996 sowing date. 
Very few seedlings emerged between the two sowing dates, which allowed 
for the use of a randomised design as the seed drill was able to pass over 
previously sown plots. 
Two genotypes were used: 
 ILL 780. The high yielding genotype, from Syria used in the previous year; 
 WA 8649090. A small green-seeded genotype, from breeding germplasm 
selected in the USA, with a hundred seed weight of 3.1 g. In a previous 
winter-sowing field trial at Sonning, the seed dry weight yield was 2.48 t 
ha'1 in 1995/96 (plot yield converted to equivalent field yield, N. O. Smith 
pers. comm.). In the preliminary trial in 1996/97, this genotype provided a 
similar yield (see Chapter 4) to that of the 1995/96 trial. 
The target plant population densities were 25, 50, 100, 200 and 400 plants 
m"2. Plots were overseeded by 30% to allow for non-emergence and seedling 
mortality. The field plan is shown in Figure 3.3. 
Population counts were made on 3 December 1997 and again on 17 April 
1998. These data allowed the calculation of winter survival and the spring 
count was also taken as the plant population density for subsequent 
calculations of mean seed yield per plant. 
The herbicide Imazethapyr (Tradename Pursuit Cyanamid) was applied 
before seedling emergence at a rate of 0.35 kg a.i. ha"' in order to control 
broad-leafed weeds. Grass weeds and spring-germinating weeds were 
controlled by regular hand-weedings during spring and summer. 
Plots were harvested when the plants were assessed to be at Growth Stage 
R8 (Erskine et al. 1990). Genotype ILL 780 sown at the first sowing date was 
harvested between 9 and 15 July 1998 (268 - 274 DAS), and those plots 
sown at the second date were harvested between 9 and 20 July 1998 (251 -
262 DAS). Genotype WA 8649090 took longer to mature, those plots sown 
at the first date were harvested between 20 and 28 July 1998 (279 - 287 
DAS), plots sown at the second date were harvested during the same range 
as the first sowing (262 - 270 DAS). The central square metre of each plot 
was cut by hand at ground level and plants were placed in paper sacks for 
storage prior to threshing. Other experimental details are identical to those 
described for the 1996-97 experiment.

3.3 RESULTS 
3.3.1 Experiment 1 (1996/97) 
3.3.1.1 Emergence 
The December plant counts were expressed as a percentage of the number 
of seeds sown to give a value for emergence. The mean values are shown in 
Table 3.1. The data were arc-sine transformed prior to Analysis of Variance 
(Appendix 3.1). There was no significant effect of sowing rate (P>O.l) or 
genotype (P>O.l) on emergence. The mean emergence was 73 %.

3.3. 1.2 Final Establishment 
The population counts taken in Spring 1997 were used to obtain a figure for 
final establishment. The mean values are detailed in Table 3.2. The data were 
arc-sine transformed prior to Analysis of Variance (Appendix 3.2). There was 
no significant effect of either sowing rate (P>O.l) or genotype (P>O.l) on final 
establishment of the crop. Mean final establishment was 74 %. In some 
treatment combinations, final percentage establishment (Table 3.2) was 
slightly greater than values calculated for emergence (Table 3.1) due to a 
small number of seedlings emerging after the winter.

3.3. 1.3 Winter-survival 1996-97 
The plant counts from March 1997 were expressed as a percentage of the 
plants present in December 1996 (% winter-survival). These data were then 
arc-sine transformed to allow statistical analysis of the results. 
An initial Analysis of Variance was undertaken (Appendix 3.3) which revealed 
a significant positive effect of the number of seeds sown (m
) on the survival 
of seedlings over winter (P<O.OS). However, there was no significant effect of 
genotype (P>O.l) despite the 49% difference in mean seed weight. There was 
not a significant genotype by sowing rate interaction (P>O.l ). Table 3.3 shows 
the mean winter survival of both genotypes at the different sowing rates.

The winter-survival data (for both accessions) were plotted against the 
number of seeds sown per m2 (Figure 3.4). A linear regression of the form: 
y = a+bx 
described the relation (r2= 0.16, 28 dJ.), where 
y = Angular transformed % winter survival 
x = Number of seeds sown per m2 
a = 63.0 (s.e. 4.92) 
b = 0.042 (s.e. 0.018) 
The gradient has a t statistic of 2.3 which is significant (P = 0.03). The addition 
of a quadratic term to the model showed no significant improvement in fit 
(P>0.05). The poor fit (R2 = 0.16) is likely to be due to the great variation in 
winter survival of seedlings at low populations. The reasons for the variation 
in apparent survival are discussed in a later section of this chapter.

An initial Analysis of Variance of the yield data (Appendix 3.4) showed a 
significant effect of sowing rate on seed yield for both genotypes (P = 0.04). 
There was also a significant effect of genotype on seed yield (P<OoOOl). There 
was no significant block effect (P>O.l) and no significant interaction between 
genotype and population density on yield. Table 3.5 shows the mean seed 
yields (g dm mo2 ) for each genotype at each population density.

The data for seed yield were first plotted graphically. This plot suggested that 
there was a parabolic relation between seed yield per unit area and plant 
population. Holliday's (1960) equation of the yield density relation (Equation 
1) was fitted followed by Bleasdale's Simplified Equation (Equation 3). 
In order to fit Equation 3, the value of 8 had to be estimated. In the first 
instance, an approach such as that used by Bleasdale (1966b & 1967) was 
undertaken. The allometric relation of plant growth was plotted (10810 seed 
yield per plant against 10glo total biomass yield per plant), in which the slope 
of the regression line is 8. The regression statistics for ILL 780 are given in 
Table 3.6 and for ILL 1878 in Table 3.7, and the corresponding relations are 
shown in Figure 3.5, from which the apparent Harvest Indices can be 
calculated (Table 3.8).

The estimated values of e (i.e. 0.90 for ILL 780 and 0.84 for ILL 1878) were 
then substituted into Equation 3 to fit the model to the experimental results 
for each genotype. When fitted to the data, however, the resulting reciprocal 
yield-density curve did not fit the observed results accurately. 
An alternative method was then used to determine the best fit value of e. A 
regression of 1/wp9 versus p was performed using different values of e (from 
0.1 to 0.95 in incremental steps of 0.05). A plot of the resultant R2 against the 
range of assumed values of e was produced (Figure 3.6). The value of e 
which gave the highest R2 value (i.e. 0.8 for ILL 780, 0.35 for ILL 1878) was 
then used to fit the reciprocal yield-density curve. However, again this did not 
provide a good fit to the observed results for ILL 780. The yield-density curve 
was then redrawn using the best-fit value of e for ILL 1878 for both 
genotypes. Tables 3.9 and 3.10 and give the values of the regression 
constants for each genotype. Figure 3.7 shows the regression line fitted for 
each genotype by Bleasdale's Simplified equation when e = 0.35. These fitted 
the observations well. 
The resultant yield-density curves for both genotypes confirmed parabolic 
relations between seed yield and density, with maximum yield of 350 g dm 
m-2 for ILL 780 and 200 g dm m2 for ILL 1878 at around 90 - 120 plants m-2 
(Figure 3.8).

The plant counts taken In May 1997 (Table 3.11) showed that the 
populations achieved for Redchief were close to the target values except at 
the two greatest populations. In contrast, ILL 1878 showed reduced 
populations than those targeted (Table 3.11). The plant counts were used in 
the later calculations of yield per plant.

3.3.2.2 Yield per unit area 
The initial Analysis of Variance (Appendix 3.5) showed a significant effect of 
sowing rate on yield. It is likely that the low yields of ILL 1878 were due to 
the poor adaptation of this genotype to spring sowing {Table 3.12}. As a 
result, the yield-density relations were only investigated for Redchief.

The estimation of e for Redchief was performed in the same way as described 
for Experiment 1. The slope of the regression line of loglo w versus loglo wp 
was estimated to be 0.94 (Figure 3.9). When this value was used to plot the 
reciprocal yield-density relation it did not fit the observed data well. As a

result the best-fit value for 8 obtained in Experiment 1 (i.e. 0.35) was used. 
Table 3.13 gives the values of the regression constants for Redchief when

were arc-sine transformed prior to analysis using Analysis of Variance 
(Appendix 3.6). There was a significant effect of genotype (P=0.01) and 
sowing rate (P<O.OOl) on emergence, being greatest at the lowest sowing 
rate and in ILL 780. There was no significant effect of sowing date (P>O.l) on 
emergence, and no significant interactions.

The data from the plant counts in April 1998 and December 1997 were used 
to ascertain the percentage winter survival of plants in each plot (Figures 3.11 
and 3.12). The winter-survival data were arc-sine transformed prior to an 
initial Analysis of Variance (Appendix 3.8). This showed no significant effect 
of sowing rate (P>O.l) or genotype (P>O.l) on winter survival (Table 3.16) and 
there were no significant interactions. Although not significant (P>O.l), the 
earlier sowing had slightly better mean survival (83%) in each genotype 
(Table 3.17).

The final plant population densities were close to the target values at the 
lower sowing rates, but were reduced at the higher sowing rates (Table 3.18). 
There was little effect of sowing date on final population, perhaps not 
surprising given that the two dates were only 17 days apart. The population 
counts were used in the subsequent calculation of yield per plant.

The yield data from the 1997-98 study were initially subjected to Analysis of 
Variance (Appendix 3.9). This showed a significant effect of genotype on 
yield (P<0.001) and also an effect of sowing rate (0.1 >P>O.OS). There was a 
significant interaction between genotype and sowing rate (P = 0.027), but no 
significant effect of sowing date on seed yield for either genotype (Table 
3.19). Table 3.20 details the mean yields for each genotype sown at each 
density. The yield of ILL 780 was reduced by 17% in comparison with the 
1996-97 season.

In order to fit Bleasdale's Simplified Equation (Equation 3), the same process 
to best estimate e was used as undertaken in analysing the 1996-97 data. 
First a regression of loglo total biomass yield per plant versus loglO seed yield 
per plant was performed. Tables 3.21 and 3.22 show the regression for ILL 
780 and WA 8649090, respectively. Figure 3.13 shows the fit of these 
regression lines to the data. The apparent Harvest Index values for each 
genotype were greater at low plant populations and in WA 8649090 (Table 
3.23).

The values of e estimated from the allometric relation did not give a good fit 
to the reciprocal yield-density data. The approach used in 1996-97 of varying 
the values of e in a stepwise progression in a regression of 1/Wp9 against p 
was therefore undertaken. Figure 3.14 shows the results of this approach. 
The estimated best fit values of e were then substituted into Equation 3 and a 
regression was performed. As discussed later, the assumed best fit values of e 
for both genotypes did result in a satisfactory yield-density curve to the 
observed data points. The value of e found to give a good fit to the observed 
data in 1996-97 (Le. 0.35) was then substituted into Equation 3 and a 
regression analysis performed. The values for the constants are detailed in

A comparison of regressions for l/wpo = a + pp for sowing date, genotype 
and their interaction was performed. The Analysis of Variance tables are in 
Appendix 3.10. The results of this analysis showed that the approach of fitting 
yield-density curves individually to the genotypes (but ignoring the two 
sowing dates) was the most accurate justified by the data.

Kusmenoglu and Aydin (1996) reported a significant effect of plant 
population density on over-winter survival of lentil crops in the highlands of 
Turkey. In that region, stand densities of 400 plants m,2 survived completely 
whilst all plants at 200 plants m,2 were killed. Given this information, it was 
hypothesised that population density may play an important role in 
determining winter-survival of a lentil crop when grown under UK conditions. 
The results of the 1996-97 experiment when analysed confirmed a consistent, 
albeit shallow positive relation between winter survival and plant population 
density. The model suggests that an increase in winter-survival of the order of 
10% can be expected when target density is increased from 50 to 200 plants 
m2 under the climatic conditions experienced during that winter (Figure 3.4). 
Subsequent results from an experiment conducted in 1997-98, however, did 
not show any significant effect of plant population density on winter survival. 
Sowing date also did not have a significant effect on winter survival, although 
there was a general trend of decreased survival at the second sowing date. 
The second sowing date was outside the "safe window of opportunity" for 
sowing as discussed in Chapter 2, but the winter experienced during 1997-98

The 1996-97 study findings bears out the published work from winter-sowing 
in Turkey, in demonstrating a positive effect of density on crop survival. It is 
likely that the winter weather experienced did not reach sufficiently stressing 
conditions that crop failure was experienced (Table 3.26). Indeed, in Turkey 
where this response was discovered, it is only in about one year in ten that 
winter temperatures drop to a point where crops sown at the lower density 
will not survive (Erskine, pers. comm. 1998). This is borne out by Levitt (1980) 
who asserts that "test winters" occur about once in every ten years. The 
increased sowing rate therefore acts to provide an insurance for the most 
climatically extreme years.

The second sowing date was outside the "safe window of opportunity" for 
sowing as discussed in Chapter 2, but the winter experienced during 1997-98 
was relatively mild (as discussed in Chapter 2).

It seems probable that the combination of a mild winter and heavy spring 
rainfall (Chapter 2) contributed to the lack of differences in winter-survival at 
the various population densities in the 1997-98 experiment. Any differences 
in winter survival of plants grown at varying densities may have been masked 
by water-logging induced mortality. In contrast in the 1996-97 experiment, 
although there were periods of heavy rain, these occurred during the early 
parts of winter when seedlings had either just emerged or were still emerging. 
Other grain legumes (including chickpea, pea and soya bean) are known to 
be more susceptible to waterlogging with increasing plant age (Cowie, Jessop 
& MacLeod 1996a), so it is possible that lentil seedlings were less susceptible 
to the effects of excess soil moisture, than if waterlogging had occurred closer 
to flowering (Jayasundara, Thomson & Tang. 1997). 
Legumes in general are much more susceptible to waterlogging than other 
crops (Belford et al. 1980), and lentil is one of the most sensitive of the cool 
season food legumes to waterlogging (Jayasundara et al. 1997). Work on 
chickpea (Cowie et al. 1996a) and on pea (Belford et al. 1980) has shown 
that tolerance to waterlogging decreases with increasing plant age. Chickpea 
seedlings tend to be least affected, showing complete survival with only a 
35% reduction in yield compared to a non-waterlogged control. In contrast, 
chickpea plants which were waterlogged at flowering and at mid pod-fill had 
mortality rates of 30% and 100%, respectively. 
Experience is similar with UK pea crops. Excessive soil moisture causes roots 
to become anaerobic due to the reduction of soil air spaces which limits 
oxygen availability. Water and mineral uptake are also reduced. The 
experiments conducted by Belford et al. (1980) showed that waterlogging for 
2 d reduced the average oxygen concentration at 20cm soil depth to less 
than 2% compared to the ambient concentration of about 18%. It has been 
hypothesised that as a result of poor root functioning, transpiration is affected 
and in legumes, nodules start to die due to C-starvation of the Rhizobia 
combined with a lack of dinitrogen available for fixation (Cowie et al. 1996a). 
However, in a further experiment in chickpea (Cowie et al. 1996b) 
carbohydrates were seen to continue to be transported to the roots following 
a waterlogging stress, it was concluded that there was no evidence to support 
their previous hypothesis that a reduced carbohydrate supply resulted in 
waterlogging-related injuries. In a waterlogging experiment with lentil, Alcalde 
and Summerfield (1994) concluded that waterlogging sensitivity was due to 
reduced vegetative growth rather than physiological damage and that this 
accounted for the seed yield reductions seen. 
It is possible, therefore, that the periods of heavy rain and subsequent 
waterlogging during the 1997-98 winter and in early spring 1998 resulted in 
increased plant mortality which then confounded any possible differences in 
winter survival. It is also likely that the excessive soil moisture resulted in the 
lower yields experienced in the 1997-98 season compared to 1996-97, as 
discussed later. 
There are problems inherent in the method used here to determine winter 
survival, chief of which is the emergence of seedlings in the spring. At the 
dates when seeds were sown, it is likely that the cooling soil temperatures 
prevented some viable seeds from germinating. In effect, a form of enterzary 
plantings had taken place. Enterzary plantings are practised in Iran and other 
regions of the middle-east (Kanooni 1995) whereby seeds are sown in winter, 
before the first snowfall, but will not germinate until early spring when the soil 
temperature warms sufficiently to exceed the base temperature for 
germination (Tb)' The seeds then germinate, but at a time when it would 
normally be impossible for the farmer to work the land for normal spring 
sowing. In this way, the lentil crop experiences many of the benefits of winter 
sowing (i.e. increased vegetative period, maximal use of available spring light, 
efficient use of winter rainfall and earlier crop maturity) but without the plants 
having to endure the harsh winter conditions. 
One possible method to overcome the difficulties in quantifying winter 
survival may be to mark the seedlings first counted in December so as to 
distinguish over-wintered seedlings from those emerging in early spring. This, 
however, presents difficulties in choosing an appropriate method for 
identifying previously counted seedlings. Plant tagging could have resulted in 
seedling damage either immediately at the time of tagging or later in the 
growing season and also the tags could be damaged or lost during the winter. 
It is also quite likely that most methods of tagging would have resulted in an 
alteration of the plants' microclimate and so again would have affected the 
survival of the crop. It is also known that due to the hypogeal germination of 
lentil, any seedlings which are killed above-ground may not be lost, as 
seedlings are capable of initiating new branches from the first node which 
remains below the soil surface (Summerfield 1981). Plants regenerating in this 
way, would not allow winter survival to be determined accurately by plant 
tagging as the new above-ground shoots would not have been tagged and so 
the plant would not be counted. 
Although the method may not give absolute accuracy in determining winter-
survival, it remains an accepted "tried and trusted" method used by other 
researchers in determining winter-kill of lentil and other crops (Erskine et al. 
1981; Malhotra & Saxena 1993). 
The relatively good survival rate of the lowest population plots (57 - 93%) 
may be distorted due to uneven sowing (this was most obvious in 1996-97) 
which lead to clumping of seedlings and so created "microdensities" similar 
to that seen in the higher density plots. This is likely to have resulted in a crop 
microclimate similar to that experienced in the higher density plots and hence 
to increased crop survival. Although uniform spacing of seeds is possible 
through the use of hand-planting or with precision drills, this would not have 
been practical (due to the intensive labour requirements or specialist 
machinery required) and would also not be representative of the likely 
methods which UK farmers would use to sow any winter lentil crop. 
The mechanisms by which seedling density affects winter survival of the lentil 
crop is unknown, but it is likely that close spacing of seedlings modifies the 
crop microclimate such that exposure to temperature extremes is reduced. 
Murray et al. (1988) hypothesise that higher densities may result in greater 
survival by reducing cooling of stem bases and through the stabilisation of the 
boundary layer. This is similar to the benefits of the rosette structure of arctic 
plants (Jones 1992). 
Crop survival over-winter is governed by factors other than the plants' ability 
to withstand cold. Steponkus (1978) makes a distinction between cold 
tolerance and winter tolerance (the latter includes both biotic and abiotic 
stresses). Any crop genotypes used for winter-sowing must therefore not only 
be able to withstand cold and freezing conditions, but must also have a 
degree of waterlogging tolerance, disease resistance and also be able to 
compete better with weeds than non winter-adapted genotypes. The 
identification of a lentil crop ideotype for UK winter sowing is discussed later 
(Chapter 8). 
In the winter-sowings in both years increased sowing rates resulted in 
reduced emergence (%). This is seen at the highest population densities. This 
finding confirms the assertion by Ellis (1997) that in order to reach higher 
target populations, a greater degree of overseeding will be required 
compared to that needed for lower population densities. 
An additional method of increasing crop survival over winter is through the 
direct drilling of lentil seed into the previous crop stubble. The emerging 
seedlings would then be subjected to less environmental stresses than 
conventionally drilled crops, for example by promoting snow capture 
(Muehlbauer 1998). Again, an altered microclimate would be likely to be a 
major factor in any difference in crop survival. Direct drilling is used as an 
environmentally low-impact technique, one of its main benefits is a reduction 
of emerging weed seedlings due to minimum tillage (Froud-Williams, 
Drennan & Chancellor 1983) although the weed seedbank in the soil declines 
at a slower rate than under conventional tillage (Froud-Williams, Chancellor & 
Drennan 1983). However, direct drilling generally results in a greater grassy 
weed population (Froud-Williams, Drennan & Chancellor 1983), and so 
herbicides are still required. Despite these disadvantages, direct drilling may 
offer an opportunity to use lentil genotypes without good or tested winter 
hardiness. 
It is likely that in colder winters in the south-east of England the relation 
between plant population density and winter-survival will be more dearly 
defined (i.e. a steeper gradient). This is not likely to be the absolute response 
(i.e. complete mortality or complete survival) as seen in harsher environments 
such as the Turkish highlands. Milford and Huyghe (1996) report that the 
winter survival of lupin (Lupinus a/bus) varies between 10 and 70% between 
southern and northern sites in the UK. This pattern is likely to also be the case 
for winter-sown lentil. The implications of this relation for other areas in the 
UK is discussed later, but it is likely that density relations will need to be 
investigated in different locations (particularly those more harsh than 
Sonning) so as to identify the role that density might play with regard to 
winter survival. 
3.4.2 Yield-density relations 
Previous research on yield-density relations in lentil has gIven variable 
responses (Saxena 1981). In general, yields either tend to remain stable over 
a wide range of densities (Wilson & Teare 1972) or increase to a maximum 
and then remain stable until high population densities are achieved (c. 300 
plants m-2), above which they then decline (Tosun & Eser 1979). The previous 
work at Sonning, Stone (1991), demonstrated a clear parabolic relation of 
seed yield and density in UK spring-sown lentil, in which the optimum 
population was 180 to 220 plants m-2 In the present research, the responses 
recorded in the two seasons of experiments show that the relation between 
seed yield per unit area and population density was rather more parabolic 
than the trends shown by other researchers. That is the range of optimum 
plant population densities was narrower than that reported for other 
locations. 
In 1996-97, the optimum population for genotype ILL 1878 was 120 plants 
giving a yield of 200 g dm m
 Within the range 75 to 150 plants mo2 
yields were relatively stable, but above and below this range yields declined 
to values which would not be attractive to farmers. The raw data suggest that 
the response was quite flat between populations of 75 and 200 plants m
although the fitted model suggests a narrower range of 75 to 120 plants m
(Figures 3.8 and 3.16). 
Genotype ILL 780 grown in 1996-97 gave greater yields than ILL 1878. Yields 
were more variable within the experiment than for ILL 1878 and this may 
account for some of the diffIculties in determining a suitable value for e whilst 
fitting Equation 2. The curve describes a parabolic relation as predicted by 
Holliday (1960) for reproductive yield. The response rises to a maximum yield 
of 350 g dm mo2 at a population of 100 plants mo2 and then declines sharply to 
a yield of 200 g mo2 at 400 plants mo2  
Similarly in 1997-98, the individual plot yields for ILL 780 varied considerably. 
Since the initial analysis of variance gave no significant effect of sowing date 
on yield, it was decided to analyse the yield-density results for each genotype 
without the inclusion of sowing date as a factor. The model subsequently 
fitted to the data gave an optimum population in the range 80 to 110 plants 
which resulted in a yield of 250 g dm m
 Yields then declined to 150 g 
at a population of 300 plants m
 This is the same pattern as seen in 
the previous season for the same genotype, albeit that yields in 1997-98 were 
reduced by 18 - 32% in comparison with 1996-97. 
The yield response of genotype WA 8649090 to population density was also 
parabolic. However, the peak of the curve was not as distinct (i.e. the plateau 
of maximum yield was broader) as that for ILL 780. The relation was a yield of 
375 g dm m
for populations in the range 85 to 150 plants m
 Yields then 
declined to approximately 250 g d.m. mo2 at a population of 400 plants m
The problem with fitting Bleasdale's Simplified Equation (Equation 2) to the 
yield-density data in each season came when seeking a suitable value for S. 
Bleasdale (1966b, 1967) proposed that assuming the total plant biomass 
yield-density relation was asymptotic, i.e. 
l/wG = u+pp Where 8 = 1 
Then 8
could be determined as the slope of the regression line of log w 
versus log wr . The difficulty with obtaining the value for 8p in this manner for 
lentil is that it is not possible to accurately obtain a value for total plant 
biomass at maturity. As lentil plants approach reproductive maturity they lose 
biomass through abscission of senesced imparipinnate leaves (Whitehead et 
al. 2000) and also from abscission of some pods. Qualitative observations of 
plots following harvest revealed that there was proportionately more biomass 
left on the soil surface at the greater population densities. Obtaining an 
accurate measure of the amount of biomass lost prior to harvest was 
impossible. Leaves are lost gradually as the plant matures and can be blown 
away also. In wetter seasons (as experienced in 1997-98) this material would 
start to decompose. Pot-grown plants may give an indication of the amounts 
of biomass lost, but results would be likely to differ from those in field-grown 
plots. 
The second approach used to obtain a value for 8 was through the use of 
optimisation procedures, which gave a value for genotype ILL 1878 of 8= 
0.35. This value then gave the best visual fit to the results for the other 
genotypes used, even though it did not give the best statistical fit to the data 
for those genotypes. The values predicted through the optimisation 
procedures (Figures 3.6, 3.14 and 3.15) for the other genotypes resulted in 
yield-density curves which did not adequately describe the relations seen in 
the raw data for seed yield per unit area. It was therefore decided to use the 
value of e found to describe the yield-density relation of genotype ILL 1878 
for all genotypes at all sowing dates. The use of e = 0.35 was therefore a 
compromise between statistical best-fIt procedures to derived data and 
accuracy in describing the observations for seed yield per unit area. 
Experiment 2 investigated the yield density relations of spring-sown lentil in 
1997. The results for Redchief demonstrated a parabolic relation of seed yield 
to population density. The optimum population was between 120 and 180 
plants m-2, which is broadly in line with the values reported by Stone {1991}. 
The yield of ILL 1878 was very poor due to the poor adaptation of this 
genotype to spring-sowing. 
The higher optimum population for maximum seed yield in spring-sown lentil 
compared with winter-sowings is most likely to reflect differences in plant 
structure. Winter-sown plants have a longer period of vegetative growth, 
therefore the plants are larger and have a greater number of branches and 
reproductive nodes for a given population density than spring-sown plants 
grown at the same density. 
3.5 CONCLUSIONS 
The series of experiments reported here have shown that there is little 
variation between genotypes with regard to the absolute value for the 
optimum population density for seed yield in lentil. This value is in the range 
90 to 120 plants m-2 which encompasses a shallow, if not flat, gradient on the 
parabolic yield-density curve. 
Combining the data for winter-survival and yield-density, it is clear that under 
UK conditions, a suitable pre-winter target population would be between 150 
and 200 plants m-2 Sowing seed at a rate of 190 seeds m-2 allowing for non-
emergence of 20% gives a pre-winter population of 150 plants m-2 The 
model prediction of 80% winter survival then results in a spring population of 
120 plants m-2 which is within the optimum population range provided by the 
yield-density curves. 
The relation between seed yield and population density for winter-sown lentil 
is parabolic as it is for the spring-sown crop too. However, the optimum 
population for spring-crops is greater (120 - 170 plants m-2) than that for 
winter-crops, given the shorter durations available for vegetative growth and 
reproductive maturity. 
It is likely that most winter-adapted genotypes of lentil would not produce 
adequate seed yields if sowing were to be delayed until spring. The economic 
response curves for the genotypes investigated here are discussed later (pp. 
145 - 150). However, these target spring populations would result in an 
economic return within the optimum range for maximum profit. 
CHAPTER 4-
GENOTYPE PERFORMANCE AND ASSESSMENT OF YIELD 
STABILITY AT THREE UK SITES 
4.1 INTRODUCTION 
There are more than 7000 lentil genotypes in the world lentil germ plasm 
collection, of which 3592 have been screened by ICARDA for winter-
tolerance (Erskine et al. 1981). The outcome was to rate 238 as cold tolerant. 
In 1996, the Crops Research Unit at Sonning had seed of 24 of these 
genotypes (both from the ICARDA collection and from breeders seed) in cold 
(4C) storage. The selection criteria for those used in this research have been 
described in Chapter 2 (pp. 27 - 39). 
Genetic yield potential is modified to a greater or lesser extent by the 
environment in which the crop is grown. In order to maximise productivity, 
the genotype must be physiologically well adapted to the environment 
(Summerfield 1981). The preliminary investigations detailed herein were 
designed to examine the adaptability of lentil genotypes to winter-sowing in 
UK environments. Most lentil genotypes originated in environments very 
different to those of the UK. Given the lentils' requirement for free-draining 
light soils, potential areas of production in the UK are most likely to differ 
climatically than edaphically. 
The UK has a diverse range of arable environments each with local climatic 
and edaphic conditions. In order to identify suitable genotypes for winter-
sowing under UK conditions, yield stability must be assessed at various 
locations. The first experiment reported in this Chapter describes an 
investigation in 1996-97 which examined the performance of 12 genotypes 
of lentil when sown in autumn. The information gained and that from the 
experiment reported in Chapter 3 (pp. 40 - 82) allowed the selection of six 
genotypes (based on seed yield and quality characteristics) to be used in a 
subsequent genotype x environment investigation. That investigation 
examined yield stability at three sites in two years (a total of six environments) 
when grown under the same agronomic protocol. The genotype x 
environment interaction has been explored using an approach similar to that 
of Finlay and Wilkinson (1963) which describes the relative yield stability and 
environmental adaptation of the genotypes graphically. 
4.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 
4.2.1 1996-97 Genotype evaluation 
Twelve genotypes of lentil were sown in a randomised block design on 5 
November 1996 (Figure 4.1). Three blocks were used and each plot 
measured 3 m long by 2 m wide. Eleven of the genotypes had been supplied 
as cold-tolerant genotypes: a spring-sown genotype (cv. Lentille de Puy) was 
included as a control. The plots were sown using a Trialsmaster small-plot 
drill. Row width was 11 cm, which had previously been shown to optimise 
winter survival (N.O. Smith, unpublished results 1996). 
Seeds were sown Smm deep at a rate of 130 seeds m,2 for a target plant 
density of 100 plants m2 Weeds were controlled by regular hand-weeding 
throughout the spring and early-summer, as no chemical herbicide 
formulations were approved for use on lentil in UK. A preventative fungicide

(vinclozolin) was applied at a rate of 1 I ha'l at 50% flowering. Fertiliser 
application and other experimental details were identical to those described 
in Chapter 2 (pp. 27 - 39). 
Plots were harvested when the plants were assessed to have reached Growth 
Stage R8 (Erskine et al. 1990). The central square metre of each plot was cut 
by hand at ground level and plants were placed in paper sacks for storage 
prior to threshing. Total biomass was weighed. Plants were threshed by hand. 
The majority of stems had been removed from the harvested sample. The 
remaining pods and stems were then rubbed together to open the pods, and 
a fan was used to remove stems, pods and dust from the seed fraction. The 
separate seed and haulm fractions were then weighed, and dry weights were 
determined for 10 samples each of 100g of seed and haulm after oven-drying 
at 80C for 48 h. 
4.2.2 Genotype x environment investigation 
Six genotypes were selected for growth at six UK sites (Figure 4.2) in the 
1997-98 and 1998-99 seasons. The genotypes were selected on the basis of 
crop performance in 1996-97 and to provide a range of seed quality 
characteristics (Table 4.1). Data were obtained from only three sites in 1997-
98 and these sites were continued with in 1998-99: the Crops Research Unit 
(CRU), Sonning, Berks; Processors and Growers Research Organisation 
(PGRO), Sacrewell Farm, Peterborough (0 25' W, 52 36' N); Arable 
Research Centre (ARC), Dayleaze Farm, Siddington, Cirencester (10 57' W,

experiment were: south Suffolk (00 47' E, 51 0 58' N, 70m above sea level), 
north Norfolk (00 28' E, 520 37' N, 30m above sea level), and near Andover, 
Hampshire (10 35' W, 51 0 12' N, 80m above sea level). The Andover site 
suffered from severe waterlogging during the winter and there was complete 
seedling mortality in all plots. The Suffolk site had a clay soil which suffered 
from waterlogging, such that few plants survived to maturity. The Norfolk site 
suffered from bird attack and significant weed infestation during April 1998 -
so much so that seed yields were not recorded by the grower.

In 1997-98, weeds were controlled with a pre-emergence application of 
metribuzin (Sencorex, tradename of Bayer) applied at a rate of 0.75 kg ha-
followed by hand weeding of any spring-germinating emergers. In 1998-99, 
weeds were controlled with a pre-emergence application of fomesafen and 
terbutryn (Reflex T, tradename of Zeneca) applied at a rate of 2 I ha-
 Weeds 
which emerged during late-spring and summer were controlled by hand-
weeding. 
Plots were harvested when the plants were assessed to have reached Growth 
Stage R8 (Erskine et al. 1990). At CRU and ARC, the central square metre of 
each plot was cut by hand at ground level and plants were placed in paper 
sacks for storage prior to threshing. Total biomass was weighed. Plants were 
threshed using an electric stationary thresher. Plots at PGRO were harvested 
using a Wintersteiger Nurserymaster Elite combine-harvester. Dry weights 
were determined for 10 samples each of 1 ~Og of seed and haulm after oven-
drying at 80C for 48 h. 
4.3 RESULTS 
4.3.1 Genotype performance (7996-97) 
Seedling emergence and stand establishment of all genotypes was good. 
There were no significant differences (P = 0.2, Appendix 4.1) between 
genotypes for spring population counts, which ranged from 85 to 109 plants 
m2 for ILL 7553 and ILL 4400, respectively. 
There were significant differences between genotypes in time from sowing to 
50% flowering (P < 0.001), in time from sowing to harvest (P < 0.001), and in 
harvest interval (P < 0.001), harvest index (P < 0.001), and seed and straw 
yield (P < 0.001). Those genotypes which originated from the USA took 
longest to flower but then matured more rapidly such that the harvest 
intervals (time from flowering to harvest) were the shortest of all genotypes 
investigated (Table 4.3). Seed yields ranged from 113 - 322 g dm m2 (Table 
4.3). The best seed yield was given by cv. Lentille de Puy; accession ILL 1918 
(a genotype which originated from Austria) was also very productive (280 g 
m2). Regression analyses (Appendix 4.2) revealed a negative relation between 
seed yield and crop duration (P = 0.03, Figure 4.5), but no significant relation 
between seed yield and time to flowering (P = 0.065) or between seed yield 
and harvest interval (P = 0.23). Harvest index declined significantly with 
increasing time to flowering (P < 0.001, Figure 4.6). There was a positive 
relation between seed yield and both of harvest index (P < 0.001, Figure 4.7) 
and total above-ground biomass (P = 0.002, Figure 4.8). Breeding for 
increased seed yield in lentil has correspondingly increased biomass yield

4.3.2 Genotype x environment interaction 
Spring establishment of all genotypes at all sites were good, with plant stands 
greater than 100 plants m,2, with the exception of Lentille de Puy at ARC in 
1997-98 when mean establishment was just 40 plants m,2. As discussed in 
Chapter 2 (pp. 26 - 38), 1997-98 had a wet spring and summer which lead to 
waterlogging problems at all sites, especially at ARC where the soil type is 
heavier than that at the other locations. Not surprisingly, then, ARC had the 
smallest yields for each genotype, i.e. 80 - 1510 kg ha,1 (Table 4.4), and also 
therefore the smallest environment mean (Table 4.5). In 1998-99 ARC once 
again produced the smallest environment mean yield. 
The experiment was analysed as a split-plot design, with environment as the 
main plot. Analysis of variance showed a significant effect of environment on 
seed yield (P < 0.001, Appendix 4.3), a significant effect of genotype 
(P < 0.001), and a significant genotype x environment interaction (P < 0.001). 
The Syrian genotype ILL 780 was the least productive (1190 kg ha"1) followed 
by ILL 1918, ILL 52, ILL 7553 and WA 8649090 all of which produced seed 
yields similar to the grand mean for all six genotypes of 174 g dm m"2. The 
traditionally spring-sown cv. Lentille de Puy produced the greatest seed yields 
(660 - 2820 kg ha"1) (Table 4.6). The performance of this most productive 
genotype at ARC in 1997-98 (just 660 kg ha1) shows the limitations of that 
location

An analysis of seed yields using a genotype x site x year approach (analysed 
as a split plot design with site as the main plot), also showed significant single 
effects of genotype (P < 0.001, Appendix 4.4), year (P < 0.001) and site (P < 
0.001); and also significant interactions of site x genotype (P = 0.02), site x 
year (P < 0.001), genotype x year (P = 0.006) and genotype x site x year (P < 
0.001 ). 
To further explore the genotype x environment interaction, seed yield data 
were transformed to logarithms (Ioglo) in order to introduce a strong degree 
of linearity to the subsequent regressions of individual means on environment 
means (Finlay & Wilkinson 1963). This transformation enables an analysis of 
the relative stability of each genotype (Finlay & Wilkinson 1963). The 
regression coefficients give an indication of relative stability (Figure 4.9), such 
that values close to 1.0 (Line 1 on Figure 4.9) have average stability, values 
less than 1.0 indicate a genotype with above average stability (Line 2 on 
Figure 4.9), and genotypes with a coefficient significantly greater than 1.0 
show below average stability (Line 3 on Figure 4.9). In order to justify plotting 
individual regression lines to each genotype, a comparison of regressions was 
undertaken (Appendix 4.5). This showed significant effects of environment (P 
< 0.001), genotype (P < 0.05), and the genotype x environment interaction (P 
= 0.05), and confirmed the use of individual regression lines to describe the 
response accurately. 
The regressions of individual genotype yields on environment mean yields 
(Figure 4.10, Appendix 4.6) illustrates the relative stability of a given genotype 
over the various environments. Regression coefficients (Table 4.7) close to 
1.0 were recorded for ILL 780, ILL 52 and Lentille de Puy. Only one genotype 
had a regression coefficient significantly greater than 1.0, i.e. it performed 
poorly in unfavourable environments, but as the environment improves so its 
performance increased at a rate above average (it is well adapted to 
favourable environments): ILL 1918 was the this genotype, albeit primarily as 
a result of negligible yield in the poorest environment (ARC in 1996-97). 
Genotypes with a regression coefficient significantly smaller than 1.0 were 
recorded for WA 8649090 and ILL 7553.

A plot of regression coefficient versus genotype mean yield for each 
genotype (Figure 4.11) describes the adaptability of each genotype and its 
relative yield (Finlay & Wilkinson '1963). This presentation confirms previous 
interpretations, Le. of the genotypes grown in the two seasons, III 780, III 
52 and lentille de Puy exhibit average stability (of which III 52 and lentille 
de Puy are better yielding and so can be described as being better adapted 
to the environments in which they were grown). Genotype III 1918 is the 
most sensitive to environment (Le. it yields poorly in unfavourable 
environments) whereas ILL 7553 and WA 8649090 are well adapted to the 
environments in which they were grown (yield performance above average) 
and were the most stable. 
4.4 DISCUSSION 
The relative performance of each genotype and their yield stability (Figure 
4.11) are perhaps not surprising considering their respective areas of origin. 
Lentille de Puy is of north European origin and this may explain why it is well 
adapted to UK conditions. However it has not been specifically bred for 
winter hardiness, which could cause problems if grown in areas of the UK

genotypes of lentil: ILL 780 (0), III 52 (0), WA 8649090 (~ ), ILL 7553 (\7 ), Lentille de Puy 
( 0 ), ILL 1918 (0 ). The solid line indicates average relative yield stability, values above the 
line exhibit below average yield stability, and values below the line exhibit greater than average 
yield stability 
where colder winters are experienced than those at Sonning. The seed quality 
is excellent, and there is a limited, but lucrative, market for it. 
Similarly, ILL 1918 is also of European origin (Austria). Its mean yield was 
slightly smaller than the grand mean: it was the very poor performance at 
ARC in 1997-98 (8 g dm m-2) which lead to it being identified as relatively 
unstable. Seed quality was variable, being best in the most favourable 
environments. 
The Syrian genotype ILL 780 produced a less than average yield (119 g dm 
m-2) but had average stability across all environments. It produces a large 
green seed of good marketable quality. Unfortunately it has a tendency to 
lodge and appears especially susceptible to disease such as Botrytis fabae. 
Genotype ILL 52 is of Iraqi origin, and gave above average seed yields 
(178 g dm m-2). Seed yields increased at more favourable environments, but 
yield stability was also relatively good. 
Of the two genotypes with above-average yield stability, ILL 7553 is of Syrian 
origin, and produced average yields (174 g dm m-2) of good quality seed. 
The USA genotype WA 8649090 gave above average yields with above 
average stability of excellent quality seed. 
The yields at ARC in 1997-98 were the smallest of all environments (72 g d.m. 
m-2), which is possibly a response to waterlogging during the winter months. 
Of all the environments, ARC in both years proved the least favourable. This 
was as expected, because soil type is heavier than would generally be 
recommended for the crop and the site was also more exposed. The Sonning 
site was the most stable of the environments across years (environment mean 
yields were 197 and 199 g m-2 in 1997-98 and 1998-99, respectively) and the 
environment mean yields were above average in both years (grand mean 175 
g dm m-2), and it is therefore probably the best environment for lentil 
production. The site at PGRO was quite favourable for lentil production in 
1997-98 the environment mean yield (166 g dm m-2) being just below the 
grand mean for all environments. In 1998-99, PGRO proved the most 
productive environment (262 g dm m-Z). 
Lentil production in the UK should be at sites with free-draining light soils (e.g. 
sandy loams). This therefore would suggest that areas of the country 
traditionally used for pea production, i.e. south and east England (Table 4.8), 
would be most suitable.

That Lentille de Puy and WA 8649090 were productive genotypes with good 
stability may reflect the fact that they originate from similar latitudes. The 
greater stability of WA 8649090 is likely due to its greater winter hardiness 
and growth habit - it exhibits a prostrate growth habit until late-spring when it 
branches profusely and then rapidly forms a dense canopy. Both genotypes 
appear to be disease resistant and have good marketable seed characteristics. 
Dual-season lentil genotypes have been identified (Ali et al. 1991), and given 
that Lentille de Puy is traditionally a spring-sown lentil but performed well 
when winter-sown in these experiments, this could indicate its potential for 
use as a dual-season genotype. 
Future research strategies should involve a larger number of environments in 
the south and east of the UK. These experiments should be run over several 
seasons, using a network such as employed by NIAB. The genotypes WA 
8649090, ILL 7553 and Lentille de Puy are the most promising of those 
examined in this experiment. Any future work should involve genotypes 
which were bred at similar latitudes and with similar winter conditions (Le. 
wet and cold) to those experienced in UK environments. 
For the time being, the best recommendation of genotype for commercial 
production is WA 8649090 given that farmers are traditionally risk averse. 
This genotype has good yield, good quality, and excellent yield stability. 
CHAPTER 5-
MECHANICAL HARVESTING OF THE LENTIL CROP 
5.1 INTRODUCTION 
Lentil has traditionally been grown as a crop of subsistence agriculture 
throughout West Asia, North Africa and the Indian subcontinent, and as such has 
been produced in a labour-intensive manner. Of all the activities involved with 
growing the crop, harvesting is the most resource intensive. Typically plants are 
hand pulled when almost 60% of the pods are golden-brown and are then left to 
dry in the field for several days prior to threshing (Erskine 1985; Khayrallah 
1981). Threshing is then carried out either by hand, or with animal-drawn 
sledges, or through the use of stationary threshing machines. In contrast, lentil 
production in the USA and Canada is mechanised and the crop is harvested with 
combine-harvesters (McDonald & Copeland 1997). Swathing is generally 
performed prior to combining to dry the plants and kill any green weeds. The 
crop is cut when the pods are a golden colour and swaths are combined 10 - 14 
d later (Muehlbauer et al. 1997). Traditional harvesting methods can result in 
seed losses of between 10 and 20% (Khayrallah 1981) while experimental 
reports of up to 55% losses have been cited by Muehlbauer et al. (1997) for 
mechanical harvesting. 
Dedicated lentil harvesters have been designed and manufactured (Khayrallah 
1981) and typically work using a pair of counter rotating belts which pull the 
plants from the soil and then act to thresh the seed from the haulm. However, 
lentil harvesters, whilst being effective, have never been produced commercially 
due to the small global market demand. In assessing the suitability of lentil for 
UK agriculture, it is important that the crop can be harvested with minimum 
losses using standard machinery currently used for cereal harvesting. 
In crops such as perennial ryegrass and oilseed rape, which are prone to uneven 
maturity and shattering, swathing is a harvesting technique employed in the UK 
(NIAB 1999b), but is not likely to be sensible for UK winter-lentil. The weather at 
harvest in UK can be unpredictable and so swathing would not be a practical 
method for lentil crop drying: in a wet swath seeds may well germinate 
precociously and fungal attack is also likely. Swathing is, however, commonly 
used for lentil in North America and therefore was also used as a harvesting 
method in the experiment reported here. 
An alternative to mowing and swathing is the use of a chemical desiccant such 
as diquat, which is commonly applied to UK crops of pea and oil seed rape 
(NIAB 1999a, b). As the lentil is botanically indeterminate, it is not uncommon to 
find plants with both mature seeds ready for harvest and also open flowers. The 
application of desiccants leads to uniform crop maturation and kills green weeds 
which may otherwise cause problems with harvesting. Tang et al. (1992) 
reported that the use of diquat as a desiccant accelerated the drying of a lentil 
crop compared with swathing. They found that desiccation had no adverse effect 
on seed germinability. However seeds from the desiccated crop required a 
longer cooking time, presumably because of changes to the seed coat 
characteristics. 
Previous research on spring-sown lentil in the UK (Stone 1991) investigated 
mechanised harvesting on-farm, but poor plant population densities 
(approximately 50 plants m<2) and considerable lodging meant that seed losses 
were severe. Average harvested yield was only 0.6 t ha<' with a further 0.3 t ha<' 
in losses (from shed seed and from unharvested plants). 
The aim of this investigation was to assess whether autumn-sown lentil could be 
successfully harvested with equipment in common use on UK farms. The 
experiment investigated the differences in seed recovery between direct 
combining and cutting, swathing and combining. As an additional treatment, a 
chemical desiccant was applied to one half of the plots. 
5.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 
An area of land at the Crops Research Unit, Sonning, 28m wide and lOOm long 
was sown to cv. Redchief on 24 October 1997. Redchief was used as a 
compromise in this experiment: it is not an ideal genotype for winter-sowing but 
a large quantity of seed could be obtained for the area required. The crop was 
sown at a rate of 200 seeds m<2 using a tractor-mounted Accord pneumatic seed 
drill. Row width was 11 cm and sowing depth was 5 cm. Crop density in the 
spring (March 1998) was in the range of 80 to 100 plants m<2. Broad-leaved 
weeds were controlled with either imazethapyr (at a rate of 35 g ai ha<1) or 
metribuzin (0.75 kg ha<1) applied on 25 October 1997 before seedling 
emergence. The previous cropping history of the land and details of fertiliser 
applied is given in Chapter 2 (pages 27 - 39). 
On 8 July 1998, an SEP self-propelled pedestrian rotovator was used to divide 
the area into four blocks, each subdivided into two main plots ("rows" in the 
analysis) corresponding to the herbicide previously applied. Each main plot was 
sub-divided into four sub-plots which had one of the following harvest treatments 
assigned randomly. Paths were cut between adjacent plots to facilitate the 
different harvest treatments (Figure 5.1 ): 
1. Chemical desiccation, cut, swath and combine 
2. Cut, swath and combine 
3. Direct combine 
4. Chemical desiccation and combine 
The experimental design was akin to a split-plot design, however the application 
of herbicides in two rows meant that it could not be analysed as a true split-plot 
design. Analysis was therefore undertaken as a randomised block design with 
four blocks and two rows (corresponding to herbicide treatment). This method of 
analysis gives greatest weight to the harvest method treatment. 
The chemical desiccant diquat (Reglone, trademark of Zeneca) was used and 
applied at a rate of 2 I ha,1 with a Cooper-Pegler knapsack sprayer on 8 July 1998

pedestrian sicklebar mower on 13 July 1998 (Growth Stage R7). 
A Wintersteiger Nurserymaster Elite combine-harvester was used with lifter bars 
attached. The sieve sizes used were 20mm front and 16 mm rear; drum speed 
was 470 rpm; concave clearance was 9mm at the front and 3mm at the rear; air 
flow was adjusted such that seeds were not blown out with the straw. These 
values were determined from initial trials on a neighbouring plot of cv. Redchief; 
i.e. these values were those which resulted in a negligible losses of seed (visual 
inspection) from the back of the combine. 
Plots which were desiccated and then combined directly were harvested on 20 
July 1998 (Growth Stage R8). Those plots which were cut and swathed prior to 
combining were harvested on 22 July 1998, also at Growth Stage R8 (regardless 
of whether a desiccant had been applied). Plots which were left to dry naturally 
were harvested on 28 July 1998 (Growth Stage R8). Four 1 m2 quadrats were 
harvested by hand from the large discard area around the experiment in order to 
compare seed yield from the mechanically-harvested plots with the amount of 
seed recovered by hand harvesting. 
5.3 RESULTS 
In early spring, imazethapyr had given better control of autumn-germinating 
weeds compared with metribuzin. Neither herbicide gave good control of spring-
germinating weeds, however, such that weed densities were high throughout the 
experimental area after flowering. The principle species were poppies, corn 
spurrey and wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum l.). 
Harvested seed yield was significantly smaller (P = 0.005; Appendix 5.1) in those 
plots which had been cut and swathed compared with those which were 
combined directly (Table 5.1) despite the fact that the swaths were picked up 
well by the combine (Plates 5.1 and 5.2). It is most likely that the losses from 
these treatments were from seed shed during the period of time when the swath 
was drying (Plate 5.3; N.B. sprouted seeds). Plots which had been desiccated 
gave consistently greater seed yields than those which had been left to dry 
naturally (Table 5.2). This 18% benefit in harvested yield was on the borderline of 
significance (0.1 > P > 0.05) (Appendix 5.1). There was no significant difference 
between the two herbicides on seed yields (strictly the analysis combined the 
spatial effect of row as well as that of herbicide), and there was no significant 
interaction between cutting and desiccant treatments (Appendix 5.1). The mean 
seed yield of hand-harvested quadrats was 108 g dm m2 (s.e.m. 10.4). This value 
was almost identical to the amount of seed recovered from all 32 mechanically-
harvested plots (mean 111 g d.m. m2, s.e.m. 6.9).

Chemical desiccation resulted in better quality seed (visual inspection) regardless 
of cutting method. The seed from desiccated plots had a smaller proportion of 
discoloured seed and a larger proportion of fully-filled seeds on visual inspection 
(Plate 5.4). In contrast, seed from plots which had been cut and swathed prior to

harvest treatments, there was very little mechanically-damaged seed. 
5.4 DISCUSSION 
It is now clear that lentil can be harvested successfully uSing machinery in 
common use on UK farms. Seed yields of cv. Redchief (68 - 144 g mo2 ) were 
considerably smaller than other, specifically winter-adapted, genotypes grown in 
this season and for which yields (226 - 318 g mo2 ) are reported elsewhere in this 
thesis. The yield of Redchief in this experiment was also smaller than values 
reported in Chapter 3 (pp. 40 - 82) for a spring-sown crop. Competition from 
the weeds, which were not adequately controlled by herbicides, was probably 
the principal constraint in this experiment. 
Cutting and swathing is not an ideal method for crop drying in the field and 
resulted in significant seed losses (of 24%) compared with direct combining. 
Moreover, in wet years around harvest, a large number of seeds may well start to 
germinate within pods and, without frequent turning of the swaths, there would 
be an increased likelihood of fungal infection which could impair seed quality. In 
this experiment, 11.4mm of rain was received during the 10 d period when the 
crop had been cut and left to dry in the swaths. This rainfall resulted in poor seed 
quality (increased proportion of discoloured seed) compared with directly 
combined plots and plots which had had desiccant applied. 
The chemical desiccant increased the amount of seed recovered compared with 
plots which were not desiccated. This is likely to reflect a more uniform crop 
maturity compared to a naturally-drying crop where the pods on an individual 
plant can exhibit a range of maturity stages. The desiccation treatment was 
effective despite the receipt of rain during the crop drying period immediately 
prior to harvest. This is in contrast to a naturally-drying crop where rainfall prior 
to harvest is likely to keep the indeterminate plants growing and even flowering. 
In July 1998, 21 mm of rain was received in the 12 d period between application 
of the desiccant and harvest of the plots (17.8 mm received between 11 and 13 
July 1998). Despite this heavy rainfall, the moisture content of the lentil straw 
had declined to 22% compared to 42% for the non-desiccated plots in the four 
days following desiccation (values for the standing, but not swathed crop): Over 
the same period, the seed moisture content in desiccated plots had declined to 
17% compared to 22% in the non-desiccated plots. 
One important factor which must be taken into account when selecting lentil 
cultivars for the UK is that of crop architecture. It is important to cut the crop as 
close to the ground as possible. One practice to aid cutting is that of rolling the 
soil surface following sowing which aids harvest by levelling the soil to ensure a 
low cut of the crop. Additionally the canopy should be relatively resistant to 
lodging and pods should not be carried close to the ground. An additional 
source of seed loss is through pod dehiscence and pod drop. Pod dehiscence is 
genetically controlled (Ladizinsky 1979) and so indehiscence can be selected for, 
whilst pod drop, which can be a major source of seed loss at harvest (Erskine 
1985), shows little genetic variation and so is most easily reduced by harvesting 
in the early morning when there is dew on the plants and also by a reduction in 
the reel speed of the combine (Erskine 1985). 
UK arable farmers have considerable experience of harvesting crops which are 
prone to lodging - such as pea and oilseed rape. Khayrallah (1981) states that 
pea causes more problems to harvest than lentil as it is more prone to lodging. 
With this in mind, and with the results from this experiment it would appear that 
lentil cropping should not pose an insurmountable problem for UK producers 
provided that genotypes are carefully chosen. 
Finally, the comparison between direct combine-harvested and hand-harvested 
areas of the crop suggest that the yields reported for superior genotypes in 
earlier chapters following hand harvesting are likely to be realistic for combine-
havesting, although of course in the further-development of the autumn-sown 
crop for UK conditions more detailed and larger-scale trials will be required to 
confirm this initial observation. Overall, and keeping in mind the effects of 
harvest method on both seed yield and quality, the best mechanical-harvesting 
method for UK lentil may well be to apply a desiccant prior to directly 
combining the standing crop. 
CHAPTER 6-
THE EFFECT OF WINTER LENTIL AND WINTER PEA 
ON THE YIELD AND QUALITY OF A SUBSEQUENT 
CROP OF WINTER WHEAT 
6. 1 INTRODUCTION 
There are increasing demands globally for agriculture to become more 
sustainable, that is to reduce the impact of farming on the environment. The 
USA Farm Bill of 1990 defined sustainable agriculture as "an integrated system 
of plant and animal protection practices that over the long term will: 
1. Satisfy human food and fibre needs; 
2. Enhance environmental quality and the natural resources base; 
3. Make efficient use of non-renewable resources; 
4. Use natural biological cycles and controls; 
5. Improve the economic viability of farming systems; and 
6. Enhance the quality of life for farmers and society as a whole" (Lu & Kelly 
1995) 
The inclusion of grain legumes into crop rotations can go someway towards 
addressing these issues. For example, crop rotations can reduce disease and 
weed pressures in the individual component crops (Bullock 1992) and the 
reduction of chemical inputs (such as fertilisers) can correspondingly reduce 
production costs. 
6. 1. 1 Satisfying human food and fibre needs 
As discussed in Chapter 1 (pp. 1 - 26), lentil is a crop for which there is an 
annual import demand of approximately 170 thousand tonnes throughout the 
EU. Crops rich in protein are in short supply within the EU, and the cultivation 
of legumes such as lentil would help to reduce the need for such imports. In 
addition, lentil would also help to satisfy the requirement for fibre-rich 
foodstuffs to benefit human health through reduced blood cholesterol (Lairon 
1996), and a corresponding reduction in cancer risks. 
6.1.2 Enhance environmental quality and the natural resources base 
Growing a single crop in monoculture depletes soil minerals such as N, P and 
K, unless additional fertilisers are supplied. Crop rotation has long been 
practiced to reduce the adverse effects of repeated sole cropping on the soil. 
There are reports of crop rotations being used in China more than 3000 years 
ago (MacRae & Mehuys 1985). The inclusion of a grain and / or forage 
legume into a rotation can improve the productivity of a subsequent cereal 
crop through increased nutrient and water availability (Maidl et al. 1996; 
Karlen et al. 1994), reduced weed infestation and lessened disease pressure 
(pedersen & Hughes 1992; Stevenson & van Kessel 1996a), and improved 
soil structure (Bullock 1992). 
The growing of a grain legume can also reduce the need for applications of 
nitrogen fertiliser in a subsequent cereal crop. The magnitude of this nitrogen 
benefit varies between studies (even using the same cropping sequence) and 
between legume species, but is typically between 40 and 50 kg N ha-
(Ranalli 1995). Lentil has been estimated to fix between 10 and 192 
kg N ha-1 a-1, values which are similar to those for pea, i.e. between 17 and 
245 kg N ha-
a-1 (Peoples, Herridge & Ladha 1995). Despite comparable 
fixation per year, the proportion of the plants' total nitrogen requirement 
supplied symbiotically is less for pea than for lentil; 73% for pea compared to 
87% for lentil (Peoples et al. 1995). The nitrogen balance of lentil (i.e. the 
amount of nitrogen left in the soil following seed harvest) has been estimated 
to vary between -11 (when seed and straw are harvested) and +25 (when 
only seed is harvested) kg N ha-' (Bardarneh & Ghawi 1994), whilst for pea it 
is estimated to vary between -32 and +96 kg N ha-' (Evans et al. 1991). 
In a study investigating the effect of pea on a subsequent wheat crop, 
however, Stevenson and van Kessel (1996b) attributed 92% of a yield gain of 
1190 kg ha-' to non-nitrogen benefits. These benefits included reduced 
disease and weed pressure. The beneficial effects of crop rotation on soil 
parameters such as P and K availability, soil organic matter and soil bulk 
density tend to become evident only in long-term rotations (Bullock 1992). 
These edaphic factors typically decline in short-term rotations (Bullock 1992; 
Karlen et al. 1994). 
6. 1.3 Make efficient use of non-renewable resources 
The reduction of disease and weed pressures within individual component 
crops of a rotation can lead to a reduction in chemical inputs. Where 
legumes are included within a rotation, there can be a reduction in the 
requirement for chemical fertilisation (particularly of nitrogen). The reduction 
in inputs would therefore result in energy savings involved in the manufacture 
and supply of these products to the farmer, and also in the application of 
these inputs to the crop. 
6. 1.4 Use natural biological cycles and controls 
The use of rotations involving a break crop reduces disease incidence, weed 
infestation and pest pressure to the individual crop components of the 
rotation {Bullock 1992}. In the predominantly cereal-based arable agriculture 
of the UK the major break crops used by farmers are oilseed rape, pea and 
faba bean. 
Fungal diseases are a major problem in the production of high quality wheat 
in the UK, with 148.4 million spent in 1998 on agricultural and horticultural 
fungicides (British Agrochemicals Association 1999). One of the most 
problematic diseases is the soil-borne pathogen "Take-all" caused by 
Gaeumannomyces gram in is var tritid. This pathogen attacks wheat and barley 
and so repeated cultivation of these crops increases the reserves of pathogen 
within the soil and may even lead to epidemics. The use of break crops is the 
most Widely used cultural practice to control the disease. Crops such as 
oilseed rape and grain legumes are used to break the disease cycle. However, 
brassicas may deplete soil fertility following fallow and therefore increase the 
need for fertilisation of a subsequent cereal crop. 
Stevenson and van Kessel (1996b) found that leaf diseases of wheat at 
anthesis were significantly reduced in a pea-wheat rotation compared to a 
wheat-wheat rotation. They also suspected an effect of rotation on root-rot 
(Cochilobus sativus) although this was non-significant. Cook (1992) asserts 
that the use of a three-year rotation of spring barley, lentil and winter wheat 
will control take-all in wheat and root-rot in both wheat and barley. 
Crop rotations can also reduce weed infestation. Weeds tend to have similar 
growth requirements to the annual crop and this causes them to be 
problematic. In a rotation, by alternating cereal crops with broad-leaved 
crops, grass weeds are reduced in the cereal (Bullock 1992). In a pea-wheat 
rotation, grassy weed infestation of the wheat crop was significantly reduced 
compared to the second wheat in a wheat-wheat crop cycle (Stevenson & 
van Kessel 1996b). 
6.7.5 Improvement of the economic viability of farming systems 
As discussed previously, the rotation benefits of legumes include more than 
just greater nutrient availability. As a result there are several opportunities to 
reduce chemical inputs to a subsequent cereal crop, including herbicides, 
fungicides, pesticides and artificial fertilisers (notably nitrogen-based 
products). Whilst the individual cost savings may not be spectacular, the 
overall economic viability of the rotational system would be increased 
especially if combined with high gross margins for the legume break crop 
(see Chapter 7, pp. 145 - 150). 
6.1.6 Enhance the quality of life for farmers and society as a whole 
Crop rotations, by addressing these various issues, can help to reduce the 
impact of agriculture on the environment and hence benefit the public 
perception of agriculture and of the practices employed by the industry. 
Longer term, the environmental benefits of sustainable agriculture are likely to 
benefit quality of life for society as a whole through the better management 
of natural resources. 
The experiments described here compare the effect of three winter-sown 
genotypes of lentil with those of winter-pea and winter-oat on the subsequent 
productivity and grain quality of successive winter-wheat crops. The effect of 
the legumes on indicators of soil quality was also examined and compared 
with the effect of continuous cereal cropping. 
6.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 
This study was conducted over three seasons (October 1996 - July 1999). 
The winter legumes and winter oat (the reference cereal crop) were grown in 
the first season (1996-97), and winter wheat in the two subsequent seasons. 
In addition, the experiment was repeated on a second experimental area with 
winter legumes and oats (1997-98) followed by winter wheat (1998-99). The 
experimental site is managed on a four-year rotation and the land used for the 
experiments reported here had last been used for experimental purposes in 
1992. The area had been sown to maize three years prior to the experiments 
and had then been placed under rye grass (Lolium perenne l.) for the two 
years immediately before the experiments began. The pH and nutrient status 
of the soil was assessed prior to the start of the experiments in order to allow 
the application where required of P (as Triple Super Phosphate), K (as 
Muriate of Potash) and Mg (as Kieserite) so that these nutrients were non-
limiting for plant growth. The experimental areas were fertilised immediately 
prior to sowing the first crop in each sequence (Table 6.1). Nitrogen fertiliser 
was only applied to the plots of oat and not to any of the other crops.

6.2.1 First crop in the sequence 
Three genotypes of lentil were selected on the basis of previous findings (see 
Chapter 2, pp. 27 - 39) on winter survival, seed yield and quality (seed size, 
colour and uniformity). Two high-yielding genotypes were chosen, plus one 
lower-yielding genotype to investigate whether there is a difference in the 
effect of relative inherent legume seed yield on subsequent wheat yield. It is 
possible, for example, that smaller yields of the legume are due to a 
partitioning effect of fixed nitrogen within the plant, rather than reduced 
nitrogen fixation. Indeed, Ruschel et al. (1982) concluded from their 
investigations on genotypes of common bean that differences in yield were 
due both to variation in nitrogen fixation and variation in efficiency of 
nitrogen utilisation (Le. conversion of fixed nitrogen into seed protein). 
The genotypes selected were: 
 Lentil, ILL 780. A large green-seeded genotype (Thousand seed weight = 
75 g), originating from Syria. The seed dry weight yield was 3.1 t ha
when winter-sown at Sonning in 1995-96. 
 Lentil, WA 8649090. A small green-seeded genotype (Thousand seed 
weight = 31 g). The seed dry weight yield was 2.5 t hao , when winter-sown 
at Sonning in 1995-96. 
 Lentil, WA 8649014. A small red-seeded genotype (Thousand seed weight 
= 32 g). The seed dry weight yield was 1.1 t hao , when winter-sown at 
Sonning in 1995-96. 
 Pea, cv. Rafale. A white, semi-Ieafless winter-genotype bred by the Institut 
National de la Recherches Agronomique (INRA), Versailles (France) and 
supplied by John Manners and Son (Sonning Common). Thousand seed 
weight = 31 g. 
 Oat, cv. Gerald. Bred by the Institue for Grassland and Environmental 
Research (IGER), Aberystwyth and supplied by Semundo (Cambridge). 
Thousand seed weight = 37 g. 
A randomised block design was used, with four blocks each containing the 
five treatments (Figure 6.1). Each plot was 4m long by 2m wide. The 
experiment was sown using a Trialsmaster seed drill on 23 October 1996.

The repeat experiment was sown on 17 October 1997. The field plan for the 
latter is shown in Figure 6.2. 
Lentils were sown at a rate of 140 seeds m-2 Allowing for winter mortality 
and non-emergence of 30-40%, this gave a target spring population of about 
100 plants m-2 Row width was 11 cm. 
Industry recommendations for UK winter-sown pea crops are a target plant 
population of 80 plants m-2 and to allow for 20% losses over winter (PGRO 
1995). Pea was therefore sown at a rate of 110 seeds m-2  Row width was 
11cm. 
Oat was sown at a rate of 200kg ha-1 at the same row spacing as the other 
crops, i.e. 11 cm. This increased sowing rate is to compensate for reduced 
plant establishment due to the October sowing date of this experiment 
(Laverick 1997). 
In 1996-97, the lentil plots had no herbicide applied and were hand weeded 
as necessary. In the repeat experiment in 1997-98 the herbicide Imazethapyr 
(Pursuit TM, American Cyanamid Company) was applied before seedling 
emergence at a rate of 0.35kg ai ha-1 to control broad-leafed weeds. Grass 
weeds as well as spring-germinating weeds were controlled by regular hand-
weedings during spring and summer.

Broad-leafed weeds were controlled in the pea plots using 
terbutryn/terbuthylazine (Opogard 500 se  tradename of Ciba-Geigy) 
applied before seedling emergence at a rate of 2.3 I ha-1 They were 
controlled in the oat plots using methabenzthiazuron (TribunilTM, tradename 
of Bayer) applied prior to seedling emergence at a rate of 2.25 kg ha-'. 
A spring application of nitrogenous fertiliser (as ammonium nitrate) was 
applied to the oats at a rate of 110 kg N ha-1 on 22 April 1997 in accordance 
with established agronomic practice (Laverick 1997). In the repeat 
experiment the same rate was applied on 20 April 1998. 
Plots of the first crops in each rotation were harvested between July and 
August 1997, and in the repeat experiment between July and August 1998. 
Lentil plots were harvested when the plants were assessed to be at Growth 
Stage R8 (Erskine et al. 1990). Pea plots were harvested at Growth Stage 303 
(Knott 1987), i.e. all pods dry and brown and seeds dry. The central square 
metre of each plot was cut by hand at ground level and the plants were 
placed in paper sacks for storage prior to threshing. T otaJ biomass was 
weighed. Lentil and pea plants were threshed by hand. The majority of stems 
had been removed from the harvested sample. The remaining pods and 
stems were then rubbed together to open the pods, and a fan was used to 
remove stems, pods and dust from the seed fraction. The oat plants were 
harvested by hand (also from a 1 m2 area) at Growth Stage 93 (Tottman & 
Broad 1987), i.e. caryopsis loosening in daytime, and then threshed using an 
Almaco small plot thresher. The separate seed and haulm fractions were 
weighed, and dry weights determined for each of ten 100g samples of seed 
and haulm by oven-drying at 80C for 48 h. 
The remaining plant material on each plot was combine-harvested to remove 
seeds and all the legume haulm was returned to the respective plots using an 
SEP self-propelled pedestrian-rotovator, whilst the oat straw was removed. 
Prior to ploughing of the experimental area after the first crop, triangulation 
markers were put in place in the surrounding area. The experimental area was 
then ploughed. The triangulation markers allowed the location of each 
previous plot to be identified precisely. The plough furrow width was 
measured and found to be 30 cm. Consequently the start of the experiment 
for sowing of the wheat was moved 15 cm in the furrow direction to allow 
for soil movement during ploughing. All other experimental details were as 
described in Chapter 2 (pp. 27 - 39). 
6.2.2 Second and third crops 
The winter wheat cv. Hereward (bred by Plant Breeding International [PBI], 
Cambridge and supplied by Hall, Plank Robinson [HPR], Theale) was selected 
for the subsequent crop. This cultivar is widely grown in the UK and is 
suitable for bread-making (NIAB 1999c). Thus selection of this cultivar 
justified investigations into the effect of the preceding crop on wheat quality 
for bread-making purposes. 
The plots of first wheat in the first experimental area were sown at a rate of 
175 kg ha-l (thousand seed weight = 49 g) on 17 October 1997. Drill width 
was 11 cm. In the final year, the second (first experimental area) and first 
(second experimental area) wheats were sown on 16 September 1998. No 
nitrogenous fertiliser was applied to any of the wheat crops so as to maximise 
the opportunity to detect any effect of the preceding crop on the productivity 
of wheat. 
In both seasons, Tribunil was applied to all wheat plots prior to seedling 
emergence at a rate of 2.25 kg ha-1 to control broad-leafed weeds. In 1997-
98, spring applications of metsulfuron-methyl and thifensulfuron-methyl 
(Harmony MTM, tradename of DuPont) were given at a rate of 75 g ha-1 to 
control spring-germinating broad-leafed weeds. In 1997-98, diseases were 
controlled with a prophylactic applications of cyproconazole and prochloraz 
(Sportak Delta, tradename of AgrEvo) at a rate of 1.25 I ha-1 on 2 April 1998 
and a follow-up application of epoxiconazole at a rate of 1 I ha-1 on 21 May 
1998. In 1998-99 (both second and first wheats), diseases were controlled 
with an application of propiconazole (TiltTM, tradename of Novartis) at a rate 
of 0.5 I ha-1 on 19 April 1999 and an application of Sportak Delta at a rate of 
1.25 I ha-1 on 27 April 1999. No post-emergence herbicide was necessary as 
the pre-emergence treatments had been successful. 
During the spring and summer of 1998 (between 16 April and 30 June), 
measurements of the interception of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) 
were taken at approximately 14-d intervals using a Delta-T sunfleck 
ceptometer. Five measurements of PAR were recorded above the crop 
canopy of each plot immediately prior to taking five measurements below the 
crop. This allowed for the calculation of mean light interception by the crop 
canopy within each plot. 
Wheat was harvested at Growth Stage 93 (Tottman & Broad 1987) on 19 
August 1998 and on 30 July 1999 using a Wintersteiger plot combine. The 
combine was first used to cut away discard areas to leave plot lengths of 3 m. 
The length of each plot was measured prior to combining. The combine 
cutting width was 1.3 m which gave a harvest area of 3.9 m2  Seed from each 
plot was collected separately for weighing. Grain moisture content was 
determined for each plot by oven drying a 100 g grain sample for 48 h at 
80C. The straw was collected and weighed in the field. Following yield 
determination, seed samples were removed for conducting various quality 
analyses. 
Grain quality parameters determine the price paid to the grower when the 
grain is sold. It is therefore important that bread-making wheats meet the 
required quality standards to ensure maximum profit. The various indicators 
of grain quality used in this investigation (see below) are commonly used 
analyses within the UK grain industry (Gooding & Davies 1997). 
Specific weights were determined for the gram from each plot using a 
standard protocol involving the use of a Samplex chrondrometer calibrated to 
BS 4317 Part 23, 1990. 
A sub-sample of grain from each plot was removed and milled using a Perten 
Laboratory Mill 3100. A sub-sample of flour from each plot was taken and 
weighed prior to drying in an oven at 80C for 48 hours. The remainder of 
the flour samples were then placed in air-tight containers prior to any further 
tests. 
The Hagberg Falling Number (HFN) values for the flour from individual plots 
was determined through the use of a Perten Falling Number 1500 machine, 
according to British Standard protocols (BS 4317, Part 9 1982). 
Grain nitrogen concentration was estimated by near infrared reflectance 
(NIR) (Oxford Analytical Instruments QN 1 000) on dry flour samples. The NIR 
machine was calibrated against a standard curve of grain nitrogen estimated 
by Leco combustion for cv. Hereward grown at the Sonning site. 
Protein quality for bread-making was assessed by use of the sodium-dodecyl 
sulphate (SOS) sedimentation test as per the protocol BS 4317 Part 19, 1990. 
This test gives an indication of the proportion of high molecular weight 
proteins in a grain sample and reflects the quality of the dough for bread-
making purposes. 
During June 1998 (first experimental area only), root samples were taken 
from the wheat plots in order to assess any potential effect of previous crop 
on root production. Soil cores were taken from each plot using the corer 
design and method described by Welbank et al. (1973). Two 75cm deep 
cores were taken per plot, one from within the crop row and the other from 
between the rows (both cores were taken from within the discard area of the 
plot). The soil cores were then divided into sections using a knife at the 
following intervals: 0-15 cm; 15-30 cm; 30-50 cm; and 50-75 cm. The number 
of white roots visible in each cross section were counted and the core 
sections were then placed in polythene bags and stored between 0 and 4C 
until further processing. The core sections were then washed to remove soil 
and other debris using a washing can as described by Welbank et al. (1973). 
The root dry weights were recorded following oven drying at 80-85C for 
72 h. 
6.2.3 Estimates of soil nutrients 
Soil samples were taken before the experiment (first experimental area only), 
and then after harvest in 1997 and 1998. On 22 October 1996 ten samples 
were taken from the top 20cm of soil using a Dutch auger, according to UK 
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food recommendations for sampling 
design (MAFF, 1982). Following the harvest of the legume / oat plots and 
prior to sowing of the subsequent wheat crop on 16 October 1997, five soil 
samples per plot were taken from the top 20cm of soil and bulked. This 
sampling method was repeated on 16 September 1998 prior to the sowing of 
the second wheat crop. These determinations were not made for the second 
experimental area (repeat experiment). The soil samples were analysed for 
total nitrogen content using the Kjeldahl method, total organic matter content 
by combustion, and extractable phosphorous and potassium according to 
MAFF protocols (MAFF 1986). 
6.3 RESULTS 
6.3.1 First crop yields (Lentil, Pea, Oat) 
Seed and straw yields of the first crops are shown in Table 6.2. Differences in 
both seed and straw yields were significant (Appendices 6.1 and 6.2) in 1996-
97 but only seed yields were so in 1997-98 (Appendix 6.3). 
In 1996-97, the lentil genotype WA 8649014 produced a significantly smaller 
seed yield than genotypes WA 8649090 and ILL 780 (Table 6.2). The yields 
of lentil were similar to those achieved in previous years (see Chapter 2, pp. 
26 - 38) at Sonning. The yield of pea was above the UK average from 
National Recommended List trials of 5.1 t (at 15% m.c.) ha-t (NIAB 1999a) 
whilst those of oat were slightly below the average recorded from National 
Recommended List trials of 6.6 t ha-t (NIAB 1995). Straw yields of the four 
legume crops were greater than oat straw yield (Table 6.2). 
Seed yield of lentil WA 8649090 sown on a different area in the second year 
(1997-98) was similar to that recorded in the previous year (238 compared to 
251 g m-2) (Table 6.2), whereas the yield of pea was smaller (by 204 g m-
but that of oat was much greater (by 94 g m-2) as it was in lentils ILL 780 (by 
140 g m-2) and WA 8649014 (by 72 g m-2) compared with the previous 
season. Of the three lentils, ILL 780 gave the greatest yield (381 g m-

6.3.2 Subsequent crop yields (Wheat) 
Wheat grain yield in 1997-98 was affected significantly by the previous crop 
(P = 0.003) (Appendix 6.4). The yield of wheat following all genotypes of 
lentil was significantly greater (by 23%) than that of wheat following oat 
(Table 6.3), with wheat yields following lentil genotypes WA 8649090 and 
WA 8649014 significantly greater than that following pea (by 13% and 19%, 
respectively). 
In the second experimental area in 1998-99, the grain yield of wheat was also 
affected significantly by the previous crop (P = 0.008) (Appendix 6.5). The 
yields of wheat following all grain legumes except lentil WA 8649090 were 
again significantly greater than wheat following oat (Table 6.3). For both 
seasons of first wheat, wheat straw yield was not affected by previous crop 
(Appendix 6.6 and 6.7).

In 1998-99 neither grain nor straw yield of the second wheat crops grown on 
the original experimental area were affected significantly by the previous crop 
(Table 6.4, Appendices 6.8 and 6.9). The wheat grain yield benefit from lentil 
(grown in 1996-97) was only about 4 %.

6.3.3.1 Wheat grain quality in 1997-98 
The data from the grain quality assessments were subjected to Analysis of 
Variance (Appendices 6.10 - 6.24). 
There was no effect of previous crop on thousand grain weight (P = 0.83) 
(Table 6.5), or on specific weight of grain (P = 0.17) in any of the five wheat 
crops. In 1997-98, all previous treatments other than ILL 780 resulted in 
specific grain weights greater than 76 kg hl1 (Table 6.5) and so wheat from 
these four treatments met UK export requirements (Gooding & Davies 1997). 
Grain protein content was affected (P<O.OOl) by previous crop (Table 6.5). 
The ranking of protein content was the same as for grain yield (Tables 6.3 and 
6.5), and regression analysis of wheat grain protein content on total grain 
yield showed a significant positive relation (R2 = 0.60, 18 d.f., P <0.001) 
(Figure 6.3). There was no significant effect of previous crop on HFN (P = 
0.29). All previous legume crops with the exception of ILL 780 resulted in 
grain with a greater HFN than that obtained following oat. Thresholds for 
HFN in the UK vary between 220 and 2505 (Gooding & Oavies 1997) and so 
all treatments met these requirements. The previous crop also affected SDS 
sedimentation volume (P = 0.016). The ranking of these SDS sedimentation 
results were similar to the ranking of wheat grain yield except that the 
greatest wheat SOS sedimentation volumes were obtained after WA 
8649090. All three previous lentil crops provided the three largest values of 
wheat protein content and sos sedimentation volume.

wheat crops grown in 1998-99 (Table 6.6). All treatments resulted in grain 
with a specific weight greater than 76 kg hl,1 (Table 6.6). Regression analysis 
showed no significant relation between grain protein content and grain yield 
in either the first (P>O.l) or second (P>O.l) wheat crops.

6.3.4 Light interception by wheat during spring and summer 1998 
The wheat grown after cropping with lentil genotypes WA 8649090 and WA 
8649014 intercepted more light than all other treatments (Table 6.7). From 5 
May onwards to the end of June, there was a significant effect of previous 
crop on light interception on each date (Appendices 6.25 - 6.29). Mean light 
interception during the period 16 April - 30 June was significantly affected by 
previous crop (P = 0.002) (Appendix 6.30).

There was a significant positive relation between mean light interception and 
each of wheat grain yield (R2 = 0.48, 18 d.f., P < 0.001) (Figure 6.4), and grain 
protein content (R2 = 0.43, 18 d.f., P = 0.002) (Figure 6.5). 
6.3.5 Root production of the wheat crop grown in 1997-98 
Sampling depth (P < 0.001) and sampling position (P = 0.01) had a significant 
effect 011 the mass of wheat root dry matter (P < 0.001): the interaction was 
also significant (P < 0.001) (Appendix 6.31). Far more roots were found closer 
to the surface (75% more in the top 150 mm than in the second 150 mm), 
and more root mass within the crop row than between rows (by 20%). At the 
two middle sampling positions there was more root matter between crop 
rows than within the row. However, there was no significant effect of 
previous crop on root production and distribution through the soil profile or 
at different sampling positions (Table 6.8, Appendix 6.32).

The root count data were transformed using the following equation: 
y = ~(count + 1) 
before statistical analysis in order to achieve equal variances, but the raw data 
are tabulated in Table 6.9. The root count data showed a significant effect of 
sampling depth (P < 0.001), with the number of live roots decreasing at 
depths below 150 mm (Table 6.9) (Appendix 6.33). There was also a 
significant effect of sampling position on root counts (P = 0.03), but there was 
no significant effect of previous crop on root count at any sampling depth or 
at either sampling position. 
6.3.6 Estimates of soil nutrients 
The trend was for more soil N to be recorded within plots which had grown 
pea or lentil in the previous season (Table 6.10), but there was no significant 
effect of previous crop on the total nitrogen content of the soil either before 
sowing or following harvest of the subsequent wheat crop (Appendix 6.34). 
Soil N content was reduced by 3-4% between the sowing and harvesting of 
the first wheat crop (Table 6.10).

6.4 DISCUSSION 
In the sequence of crops grown from October 1997 to July 1998, winter-lentil 
increased the yield of the subsequent wheat crop compared to a previous 
cereal by an average of 1.2 t dm hao1 (ranging from 0.95 t dm ha
with ILL 
780 to 1 .4 7 t dm hao1 with WA 8649014). This response was greater than that 
following winter pea, which is perhaps not perhaps surprising given that the 
pea crop produced a greater dry seed yield than the lentil. However, previous 
research with spring-sown legume crops (Haynes, Martin & Goh 1993) 
concluded that pea can leave greater residual soil N than lentil, although this 
varies between seasonso 
In the wheat crop grown immediately following legumes in 1998-99, the yield 
benefit from winter-lentil was much smaller (ranging from 0.03 to 0.37 
t dm ha
for WA 8649090 and WA 8649014, respectively, with a mean for 
all genotypes of 0.2 t dm hao1 ). Unlike in the previous season winter-peas 
gave a similar yield benefit to that from the best lentil. 
Grain yield of wheat in 1998-99 was reduced on average by 54% compared 
to 1997-98. This decline could well be due to nitrate leaching during the 
heavy winter rains. In separate trials on adjacent land, well fertilised crops of 
cv. Hereward yielded, on average, 7 t (at 14% m.c.) ha
in 1998-99 which 
represented a yield drop of 2 t hao1 compared with 1997-98 (N.O. Smith, pers. 
comm. 1999). In addition to the yield drop due to year-on-year variation, the 
1998-99 wheat plots suffered from Fusarium infection which gave some 
stunted plants and bare patches within the stand. Anthesis occurred during 
May 1999 which coincided with a wet period when 49 mm of rain fell 
compared with 22 mm received in May 1998. Parry, jenkinson and McLeod 
(1995) suggest that optimum conditions for Fusarium ear infection are wet 
periods at anthesis coupled with maximum temperatures above 15C. Mean 
temperature in May 1999 was 13.2C, and so coupled with the rain received 
the conditions were likely to have been conducive to Fusarium infection. The 
absolute yield of unfertilised wheat plots in the 1998-99 season was in line 
with those reported by Ellis, Salahi and jones (1999) of 2.86t dm ha1 for 
unfertilised winter wheat grown at the same site in 1996-97. 
It is generally accepted that a wheat crop will accumulate 20 - 25 kg N ha1 
for every tonne of grain harvested (at 15% moisture) (Gooding & Davies 
1997). Therefore the mean grain yield increase of 1.4 t ha1 (at 15% moisture) 
in 1997-98 (compared to oat) resulting from lentil cultivation is equivalent to 
an extra 28 - 35 kg N ha1. This extra nitrogen is equivalent to approximately 
100 kg ha1 of ammonium nitrate fertiliser costing approximately 10 ($16). 
The nitrogen benefit to the wheat, so calculated, is in line with that reported 
by jensen and Haahr (1990) where the residual nitrogen benefit from pea to 
wheat was equivalent to 20 - 30 kg N ha'1. The financial benefit of the 
previous lentil crop would, however, be much larger (c. 110; $176) if 
expressed as the value of extra grain. In 1998-99 the mean grain yield 
increase due to lentil cultivation was 0.26 t ha1 (at 15% moisture), this has a 
fertiliser equivalent value of 1.90 ($3) or expressed as a value of the extra 
grain, approximately 20 ($32). 
Several reports on the nitrogen nutrition of grain legume crops have 
concluded that the net effect of legumes is a negative soil nitrogen balance 
(Badarneh & Ghawi 1994; Haynes, Martin & Goh 1993; Kurdali, Kalifa & AI-
Shamma 1997). However, those studies removed the legume haulm for 
animal feed (as is practised in many developing countries). In contrast, this 
study returned all the legume haulm to the soil, which is likely to have added 
to the soil nitrogen pool as demonstrated by the grain yield increase. In five 
cultivars of lentil grown under rainfed conditions in Syria, soil N balance was 
negative when all above-ground biomass was harvested whereas when only 
seeds and pods were removed the lentils gave a return of between 10 and 83 
kg N ha-1 (Kurdali, Kalifa & AI-Shamma 1997). 
The wheat grain yield increase in 1997-98 following legumes is likely to have 
resulted from improved light interception by the canopy (Table 6.7): grain 
yield was positively associated with mean light interception (Figure 6.4) as 
would be expected (Monteith 1977). It is suggested that increased availability 
of residual nitrogen following the legume crops encouraged rapid vegetative 
growth by the wheat crop which increased light interception. However, it is 
also possible that other factors in the rotation (such as reduced root disease 
potential following legumes) affected the ability of the wheat plants to 
maximise nitrogen use efficiency (Cook 1992). It is also widely accepted that 
crop rotations where plant residues are incorporated give rise to increased 
microbial activity of beneficial microorganisms and corresponding decline of 
deleterious microorganisms (Bullock 1992). In this study however, most of 
the beneficial yield response from legume cultivation is likely to be N-related 
as oat is not a host of take-all (Rothrock 1991). 
The regression of protein content on grain yield in 1997-98 (only) showed a 
significant positive relation (Figure 6.3). This contrasts with the widely-held 
view that increases in grain yield reduce protein content (Simmonds 1995). 
This 'cost' of increasing protein content has been hypothesised to be caused 
by the energetic costs of protein synthesis (Penning de Vries, Brunsting, van 
Laar 1974; Simmonds 1995), although no substantive evidence has been 
brought up to back this argument. In other experiments at Sonning, using cv. 
Hereward during 1997-98, there was also a clear positive relation between 
gross grain yield and protein content O.P.R.E. Dimmock, unpublished results). 
In contrast, the use of cv. Consort resulted in the generally reported negative 
relation between grain yield and protein content O.P.R.E. Dimmock). It is 
possible that the positive relation between grain yield and protein content 
was due to a superior nitrogen-recovery ability of cv. Hereward in 
comparison to other cultivars. This would help to explain its popularity as a 
milling wheat amongst farmers. There is certainly a genotypic effect on 
nitrogen recovery ability (Goading and Davies 1997). Apart from any 
genotypic effects on nitrogen recovery, the fact that the yield increase was 
likely to have resulted from differing amounts of available nitrogen may also 
have lead to the increase in protein content observed. 
Grain protein (%) contents were much smaller than would normally be 
expected in a commercial situation, and therefore would be unsuitable for 
breadmaking purposes. However, the circumstances were unusual in that no 
N fertiliser was applied to the crop so that any potential effect of previous 
crop on wheat grain yield and or quality could be detected. 
The lowest-yielding lentil genotype (WA 8649014) provided subsequent 
wheat grain with the greatest protein content in both the wheat crops grown 
immediately following legumes (Le. in 1997-98 and 1998-99). This is likely to 
have been the result of increased residual nitrogen (Table 6.10). It is 
interesting to note that in 1997-98 lentil WA 8649090 (the largest yielding 
lentil genotype) gave the second largest wheat grain yield and protein 
content but the greatest SDS sedimentation volume. There are known to be 
great differences in nitrogen-fixing ability between lentil genotypes (Kurdali, 
Kalifa, AI-Shamma 1997). It is possible, then, that WA 8649090 fixed more 
nitrogen than the other lentil genotypes resulting in the best lentil seed yield 
and subsequently better wheat grain yield and quality. 
Overall, the data from the 1997-98 crops bear out the findings of other 
rotation studies which have concluded that rotations involving a legume 
improve wheat grain yield and quality (Lopez-Bellido et al. 1998). The results 
from the first wheat crop in 1998-99 show an increase in wheat yield due to 
previous cropping history, although with no concurrent increase in protein 
quality. The much smaller grain yields are likely to be a reflection of a 
reduction in the amounts of plant-available nitrogen and hence differences in 
protein quality are much less likely to have occurred. The fact that no yield or 
quality effect of initial crop was detected in the second wheat crop (1998-99) 
is perhaps not surprising, as any fertility differences are likely to have been 
removed by the first crop of wheat. 
The yield benefits to wheat from lentil and pea recorded here can only be 
ascribed to "rotation benefits". The measurements taken of total soil nitrogen 
indicated no significant effect of previous crop. Regression analyses of soil N 
(%) at sowing both with seed yield (Figure 6.6) and with grain protein content 
(Figure 6.7) of the first wheat in 1997-98 were not significant (P>O.1). The 
superior canopy of the wheat plots following lentil would tend to indicate 
greater nutrient availability leading to better vegetative growth. Had the soil 
been tested for ammonium nitrogen then positive effects of previous crop on 
plant-available nitrogen may have been detected. The agronomic 
management of the wheat was such that it should have negated any 
differences in weed and disease pressure caused by previous cropping, which 
again backs the argument for the rotation benefit to yield of first wheats in 
this study being strongly nitrogen related. 
The estimates of soil nutrient status did not detect any significant differences 
due to the previous crop. At the outset it was not known whether any useful 
information would be gleaned from this aspect of the research. In general, 
soil parameters such as soil nutrient and organic matter content only increase 
in long-term rotations (Bullock 1992; Karlen et al. 1994). The results from this 
study indicate that there was no effect of the cropping system over the time-
scale studied on the soil parameters measured. In a similar manner, it was 
hypothesised that different cropping systems may affect the soil structure and

hence the rooting behaviour of a subsequent crop. The sampling method 
used was the least destructive to the crop, but revealed no significant 
differences due to the previous crop. An alternative approach to studying 
rooting patterns would have been the excavation of a trench and subsequent 
counting of exposed roots. That technique would not have been possible in 
this study as it would have been too costly in terms of labour and crop 
destruction. Commonly used indicators of soil structure, such as bulk density, 
were not appropriate for use on the sandy-loam soil at Sonning, as the high 
sand content results in a soil with very little structure which collapses 
following heavy rainfall (5. Nortcliff, pers. comm. 1998). 
It is now clear that when genotypes have been carefully selected for 
adaptation to UK conditions the cropping of winter-lentil can give excellent 
seed yields and also contribute positively to subsequent winter-wheat crop 
yield. It would not be economically viable in the current agricultural climate 
to suggest that all fertiliser inputs to the subsequent wheat crop can be 
removed. Nevertheless, a reduction in inputs certainly appears to be possible 
which would increase the sustainability of the whole rotation system and 
reduce production costs. This reduction in production costs could be aided 
by using a canopy management approach such as that described by 
Sylvester-Bradley et al. (1997). 
CHAPTER 7-
ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT OF 
LENTIL PRODUCTION IN THE UK 
7. 1 INTRODUCTION 
This chapter discusses the likely farm-scale production costs and economic 
returns (gross margins) based on the best agronomic practice identified in the 
current experimental programme. These gross margins are then presented in the 
context of changes in the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) which are to be 
introduced in 2000 (Anon. 1999a). Finally economic return-density relations are 
presented for two genotypes based on their seed yields in the 1997-98 
population density experiments (reported in Chapter 3, pp. 40 - 82). 
7.2 ESTIMATES OF UK PRODUCTION COSTS AND RESULTANT GROSS MARGINS FOR 
WINTER-SOWN LENTIL 
The inputs required to support a successful UK winter lentil crop are likely to 
include: 
 Pre-emergence herbicides - fomesafen and terbutryn (Reflex TTM, Zeneca) 
 Post-emergence herbicides - cinidon ethyl (LotuslM, BASF) 
 Fungicides - vinclozolin (Ronilan FilM, BASF) and carbendazim 
 Desiccant - diquat (ReglonelM, Zeneca) 
Based on the value and quantities of lentil imported to UK (HM Customs & 
Excise 1999), a monetary value for lentil seed (for both sowing and consumption) 
is estimated at 350 rl. This value has been used in the subsequent tables of 
crop castings. Lentil seed yield is taken to be 2.4 t ha1, as a conservative estimate 
of on-farm yields of a well-adapted genotype sown in the autumn and harvested 
in the following July. Seed costs are calculated for a sowing rate of 110 kg ha
(200 seeds m2 for a genotype with a thousand seed weight of 55g). Lentil gross 
margins are presented in Table 7.1 in comparison with pea and oilseed rape, 
since these are the crops most likely to compete with lentil for land in UK 
(S. Popple, pers. comm. 1999). Lentil is eligible for Area payments under the EU 
Grain Legume Aid Payment scheme, the current value of payments is 125 ha1 
(E. Willmott, pers. comm. 1999).

Lentil gross margins are greater than those of both pea and oilseed rape (Table 
7.1). Labour costs are likely to be closely similar for all three crops and so these 
are not included in the analysis. This analysis indicates that winter-sown lentil is 
indeed a potential profitable new addition to the UK arable rotation. 
7.3 EFFECT OF CAP REFORM ON GROSS MARGINS 
The CAP was introduced by the EEC to support European agriculture and 
encourage home production. In recent years, there have been pressures within 
and on the EU to reform the CAP such that agriculture is exposed to the world 
market and so competes fairly with agriculture in other countries. The major 
effect of CAP reform on the arable sector across the EU is to reduce cereal 
intervention prices (by 20%), increase Cereal Area Aid payments (to 294 ha"), 
reduce oilseed area payments to the same as those for cereals, and to abolish the 
compulsory set-aside area (Anon. 1999a). Protein crops receive an additional 
supplement of 29 ha-'. The changes to Aid payments will alter gross margins 
(Table 7.2), such that the differences between oilseed rape and pea will be 
reduced, whilst lentil will be largely unaffected as the EU Grain legume Aid 
Payment scheme is not altered.

7.4 ECONOMIC RETURN VARIATION WITH POPULATION DENSITY 
Increasing plant density does not lead to ever-increasing seed yield in annual 
crops, as shown for lentil in Chapter 3 (pp. 40 - 82), but rather there is a 
parabolic relation between plant population density and seed yield. To 
investigate whether the optimum plant population for yield matches with the 
optimum population for economic return, the yield-density relations for the 1997-
98 season were used to obtain economic response curves to population density. 
The crop input costings (Table 7.1) and a value for harvested seed of 350 r1 
were used. The resultant response curves are shown for genotypes 
WA 8649090 in Figures 7.1 and for ILL 780 in Figure 7.2. 
The response curve for WA 8649090 has a shallow decline from the asymptote, 
whilst that for ILL 780 declines much more sharply. The optimum population for 
both genotypes is within the range of 80 - 120 plants m2, which is similar to the 
optimum populations obtained from the investigation of yield-density relations, 
i.e. 120 plants m2 for WA 8649090 and 90-100 plants m2 for ILL 780 (Chapter 3, 
pp. 40 - 82). 
7.5 DISCUSSION 
The gross margins reported here for lentil are economically attractive In 
comparison with other traditionally grown break crops in UK agriculture. In 
addition, there are now a number of specialist growers within UK agriculture 
which have little demand for their traditional crops. These growers have

produced crops such as hops (Humulus lupulus L.), apples, cherries (Prunus avium 
L.) and pears (Pyrus communis L.) (E. Will m ott, pers. comm. 1999). The available 
land (particularly in the south-east) is not eligible for Area Aid Payments (but is 
productive agricultural land), although payments under the EU Grain Legume 
Payment scheme could be made to farmers producing lentil. These growers have 
expertise in producing quality products for small market demand and represent 
potentially ideal producers for UK lentil. 
Chapter 8 discusses these findings in the broader context of the main research 
project findings and the current UK agricultural situation. 
CHAPTER 8-
GENERAL DISCUSSION 
8. 1 INTRODUCTION 
The underlying goal of this research programme was to investigate the 
potential of winter-sown lentil for UK agriculture and to address key 
agronomic constraints. Subsequent sub-sections highlight the major research 
conclusions; discuss the concept of a UK winter-lentil ideotype; the likely 
problems that UK lentil production will face; the likely benefits that 
production may confer to the environment, consumer and farmer; and the 
likelihood of viable UK lentil production under current financial 
circumstances in the agricultural sector. 
8.2 OPTIMUM PLANT POPULATION DENSI1Y 
There is little variation between genotypes of lentil in the absolute value of 
the optimum population which gives optimal seed yields (see Chapter 3). The 
relation between plant population density and seed yield is parabolic, with 
the optimum population for seed yield between 90 and 120 plants m-2 
(Figures 3.8 and 3.16). The optimum population for seed yield is in line with 
that recommended by Muehlbauer (1973) of 90 plants m-2 for crops in the 
U SA, but is lower than the 194 plants m-2 estimated by Stone (1991) for U K 
spring-sown lentil. The spring-sown crop has a much shorter growth period 
and in order to establish a closed canopy to make most efficient use of solar 
radiation for maximal seed yield, a greater population is required. The crop 
grown by Stone (1991) also suffered from severe disease infection, which 
may have lead to an increased population requirement for maximal seed 
yield. 
Winter-survival is modified by plant population density, although the relation 
is represented by a shallow response curve (Figure 3.4). Combining the yield-
density and winter-survival data, a suitable sowing rate would be 190 seeds 
m2, to give a pre-winter population of 150 plants m2 (allowing for 20% non-
emergence). Winter losses of 20% (as suggested by the fitted model) result in 
a spring population of 120 plants m2 which is within the optimum range for 
maximum seed yield. 
8.3 EFFECT OF LENTIL ON GRAIN YIELD AND QUALITY OF A SUBSEQUENT WHEAT 
A benefit in wheat grain yield (8 - 23%), protein content (%) and quality (SDS 
sedimentation volume) was seen following the cultivation of lentil compared 
with oat. This benefit was observed in the wheat crop immediately following 
the lentil, but did not continue into the second wheat crop following the lentil 
(i.e. third experimental season). This is in line with the findings of other 
researchers (lopez-Bellido et al. 1998) who have also demonstrated a clear 
benefit from grain legumes to first subsequent cereal crops. 
The yield benefit in wheat is most likely to have reflected superior canopy 
growth in the plots which had previously grown lentil. This superior canopy 
development would indicate better nutrient availability for the crop which 
resulted in greater vegetative growth in those plots which had previously 
grown lentil. The investigations into soil nutrient status did not detect any 
154 . 
significant differences between previous cropping treatments. The small plot 
size (and hence greater potential for nutrient variation) may account for this 
failure to detect any significant effect of previous crop on soil nutrient status 
(Rowel 1994). 
8.4 A LENTIL IDEOTYPE FOR WINTER-SOWING IN THE UK 
A winter-lentil crop in the UK is most likely to be sown during October, and 
therefore the seeds must show uniform and rapid germination at all 
temperatures above the minimum temperature for germination, i.e. close to 
aoc (Covell et al. 1986) to produce healthy seedlings which will then need to 
survive the winter. The UK winters in the south and east are typically not as 
harsh as those experienced by autumn-sown crops elsewhere (where climates 
are more continental) and so extreme cold tolerance may not be essential. 
Nevertheless, to reduce risk (Le. crop failure in extreme years) cold tolerance 
is of course highly desirable. What is essential however for successful 
production at most UK locations is good tolerance to waterlogging. 
Genotypes differ in relative tolerance (Ashraf & Chisti 1993; Alcalde & 
Summerfield 1994) and it is likely that this is one of the major stresses that 
any UK lentil crop will need to survive. In spring, water in excess of field 
capacity is also likely to be a continuing stress, except on very well drained 
soils. 
Observations of genotypes such as WA 8649090 [assessed to be the most 
suited to UK conditions (Chapter 4)] indicates that early spring growth should 
not be too vigorous, prior to rapid tertiary branching just before the onset of 
flowering. Excessive early-spring growth can lead to lodging, as occurred 
during this research in many of the genotypes originating from the Middle-
East. 
Following flowering during May, a UK lentil crop needs to exhibit strong 
partitioning of assimilates to the developing fruits: physiological and / or 
botanical determinacy is therefore required. In other production regions 
drought forces maturation (Keatinge et al. 1995). However, severe drought 
under UK conditions is uncommon and so alternative routes to reproductive 
maturity and death are required. 
The UK ideotype should show early maturation (190 - 210 d from sowing in 
mid-October) and ideally be ready for harvest (or desiccation) during mid-July 
when there is greatest probability of warm temperatures and low rainfall. 
Provided the ideotype has not produced excessive biomass the likelihood of 
opportunistic fungal attack is reduced, and coupled with appropriate disease 
resistance (especially to Botrytis and Ascochyta) seed quality should not be 
compromised. If harvest is delayed until August, then humidities generally 
increase, as does the likelihood of rain. The consequences of an increase in 
humidity and a wet harvest is to reduce seed quality due to disease attack 
(Kaiser 1992), especially if the crop has lodged (Stone 1991). 
Of the genotypes researched here, the one recommended for future 
development of the crop is WA 8649090, a green seeded small-sized 
genotype. It has produced good yields (151 - 273 g d.m. m2; equivalent to 
1661 - 3003 kg ha' at 10% m.c.) of quality seed and has excellent yield 
stability in the environments tested to date. Other genotypes have been 
developed since the start of this research and some of these were the subject 
of preliminary investigation during the , 998-99 season. The initial results 
(Appendix 8.1) indicate that LC 9440070 (supplied by Or F J Muehlbauer) 
also has good potential for the UK: it produced 234 g d.m. m2 of excellent 
quality seed (WA 8649090 in an adjacent experiment yielded 249 g d.m. m2), 
despite a wet harvest period. The genotype LC 9440070 produces a large-
seed with red cotyledons which would be very marketable to UK consumers 
(i.e. able to show a premium over WA 8649090). 
8.5 POTENTIAL PROBLEMS FACED BY UK LENTIL PRODUCTION 
Waterlogging represents a potentially serious problem for production. Alcalde 
and Summerfield (1994) found genotypic differences in response to 
waterlogging and concluded that agronomic practices such as increased 
sowing rate could minimise seed yield losses in fields prone to waterlogging. 
Observations at Sonning during the winters of 1997-98 and 1998-99 bear out 
the different responses of genotypes to waterlogging. Moreover, the 
investigations into yield-density relations (Chapter 3) show that lentil seed 
yields can remain relatively stable at a range of plant densities (75 - 200 
plants m2). It is therefore, likely that under UK conditions, an increased 
seeding rate (from 190 to 250 seeds m
) could compensate for yield losses in 
fields which are low lying or of a heavier soil type. 
Lentil has traditionally been a crop of marginal lands in West Asia and North 
Africa, and therefore competes relatively poorly with weeds which can 
severely reduce seed yield (Muehlbauer et al. 1997). An effective herbicide, 
non toxic to lentil, has been identified during this research programme [Reflex 
T (fomesafen and terbutryn) which can be applied at a rate of 2 I hat before 
emergence] but is not yet approved for application to the crop. It has good 
residual activity and checks emerging weed seedlings until spring, when a 
follow-up herbicide is required. Preliminary trials have identified that cinidon-
ethyl (Lotus, tradename of BASF) is non-toxic to lentil as a post-emergence 
foliar herbicide [lentil is notoriously sensitive to foliar herbicides (Basler 
1981 )]. Cinidon-ethyl is not however approved by the UK Pesticide Safety 
Directorate (PSD) for application to lentil. Prior to any commercialisation, 
specific approval would be required for these products. If this were not 
granted, then costly residue and crop safety testing would be required. It is 
unlikely that funding for this testing would be forthcoming from the 
agricultural sector (c. Knott, pers. comm. 1999) due to the niche market 
status envisaged for lentil, and so it would be unlikely that the 
commercialisation of lentil production would continue. Off-label approval of 
these herbicides is therefore an essential prerequisite for commercial 
production of lentil in the UK. 
Another potential constraint, particularly in wet summers, is likely to be 
disease incidence in lodged crops. Stone (1991) found this problem to be 
particularly troublesome in spring-sown lentil crops and concluded that 
Botrytis fabae would be a major constraint to production without adequate 
control. It is likely that winter-crops of lentil maturing in July when sown at the 
optimum plant population density using genotypes with disease resistance 
from disease-free seed, will not suffer from excessive disease attack. 
Prophylactic applications of fungicide (e.g. vindozolin) at flowering, 
combined with these cultural methods of disease prevention should prove 
effective. In the three seasons of this research, there was little incidence of 
disease. The likelihood of disease would be increased if infected seed were to 
be imported, as it would be if other grain legumes were grown in close 
succession to the lentil crop (Monti et al. 1994). 
Finally, if genotypes were not carefully selected and their yield stability at 
various locations assessed, then following relatively poor years (e.g. harsh 
winters, wet summers) farmers could be discouraged from growing the crop 
again. This would be the most likely outcome if poorly-adapted, non-winter 
hardy genotypes were obtained and grown by opportunistic agronomists and 
growers. 
8.6 POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF UK LENTIL PRODUCTION 
Farming is currently suffering from a poor image with the UK consumer 
(Jenkins 1999; Purves 1999). This stems from food safety and environmental 
concerns which have been well publicised by the media (Anon. 1998a). 
Whilst the potential market for UK lentil is relatively small, any new 
agricultural practices which are environmentally sound and add to a safe and 
traceable food supply chain must be welcome (Anon. 1999b). 
8.6.1 Environmental benefits 
Lentil production in UK requires relatively few inputs (Chapter 7). No 
additional nitrogen fertilisation is required, and neither are insecticides or 
growth regulators. As a low-input crop, lentil can therefore be shown to be 
environmentally benign. As shown in Chapter 6 (pp. 110 -144), lentil 
cultivation can benefit a subsequent wheat crop through reduced fertiliser 
requirements (due to residual soil N from symbiotic dinitrogen fixation) and 
possibly by reduced disease incidence (by acting as a break crop). The yield 
increase of wheat following lentil compared to wheat following a non-legume 
under UK conditions was 8 - 23% and so greater than the 7% increase 
reported in the USA (Guy & Gareau 1998). Reduced inputs will therefore 
reduce the environmental impact of the entire rotation and also production 
costs. 
8.6.2 Consumer benefits 
The production of lentil by UK agriculture would meet the demands of the 
consumer through the production of a safe, quality assured and traceable 
product. All crop inputs would be tightly regulated, and only products with 
negligible residues could be applied. In a society increasingly concerned with 
consumption of safe foods, this would be a welcome innovation. The 
traceability of the product could be assured which again is increasingly 
demanded by consumers as revealed by the Assured Combinable Crops 
Scheme (Anon. 1998b). All genotypes of lentil are free from genetic 
modification and therefore should be welcomed by the general public as an 
additional source of vegetable protein. 
8.6.3 System benefits of lentil production 
The grower of winter-lentil could benefit from a new, profitable crop to 
include in the rotation. The gross margin of the crop itself (Chapter 7, pp. 145 
- 150) is likely to be attractive to both farmers and specialist growers. The 
gross margin is 30 - 75% greater than those for both pea and oilseed rape, 
and even without additional Area Aid these margins are very favourable. 
Coupled with the potential for reduced inputs for other crops in the rotation 
they could add to overall farm profitability. 
This research has demonstrated that lentil could fit into the farmer's year with 
little or no disruption to other tasks. The crop is sown during October, after 
drilling of autumn-cereals and generally before the onset of heavy late-autumn 
rains. The emerged crop will then overwinter and require a herbicide 
application during February/March when herbicides are applied to winter-
cereals. Lentil then flowers during May and comes to harvest during July. A 
July harvest would not interfere with cereal harvesting and thus would allow 
for efficient division of labour at a busy time of the year. Thus greater crop 
diversity on arable farms could reduce labour peaks. 
8.7 LiKELIHOOD OF UK LENTIL PRODUCTION 
The experimental work reported in this thesis has shown that a winter-sown 
lentil crop can be successfully grown in the UK and produce economically 
attractive yields of good quality seed. The production of lentil also benefits a 
subsequent wheat crop through increased grain yield and grain quality. The 
lentil crop can be sown, attended to and harvested using standard UK 
agricultural machinery and available chemicals. The most suitable land types 
have been identified and genotypes with potential for continued production 
under UK conditions have been identified. This has lead to links with the 
industry, and the first stages of commercialisation are in hand. In order for this 
research to have practical impact, and the introduction of the crop to UK 
agriculture to occur, several further issues need to be addressed: 
1. Approval for chemical inputs must be granted by PSD. Without this 
approval, weeds are likely to prove troublesome constraints. 
2. Multiplication of seed of suitable genotypes (currently WA 8649090) must 
be undertaken so that production risks are minimised. If non-adapted 
genotypes were to be grown, then a negative experience of the crop by 
farmers would damage the crop's reputation. 
3. Production areas where the crop would be well suited need to be 
identified. Demonstration crops should be grown to raise awareness of 
the crop and its potential for UK agriculture. 
These points have been addressed by the industry when introducing 
soyabean and navy bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) to UK agriculture in recent 
years (Dodd, 1991; Willmott et al. 1999), with the result that production areas 
are increasing and that farmers are increasingly open to new crop 
opportunities. However, lupin (Lupinus spp.) suffered from a damaged 
reputation due to poor establishment and small yields when first introduced, 
and is still perceived by many growers as a risky crop despite the 
development of well-adapted cultivars and well-researched agronomic 
packages in recent years (Milford & Huyghe 1996; Shield et al. 1996). 
8.8 FUTURE RESEARCH PRIORITIES 
The first priority for future research should be to investigate the effect of 
waterlogging on winter-lentil performance. This should include an assessment 
of the importance of timing of waterlogging (at various Growth Stages of the 
crop) to assess whether lentil responds similarly to pea and chickpea (Belford 
et al. 1980; Cowie et al. 1996a), the duration of the stress and the interaction 
with the mean temperature and nitrogen regime at which waterlogging 
occurs. These investigations are most suited at least initially to experiments 
under controlled conditions. The results of these investigations should then of 
course be compared to field observations of responses to waterlogging in 
order to extrapolate the findings. As a further study, investigations into the 
optimum plant population density for maximum yield compensation following 
waterlogging should be undertaken, in order to give a sowing rate for areas 
where waterlogging is a possibility during winter. 
Another area for future research is to identify further herbicides for the crop. 
Reliance on one or two chemicals could be problematic due to possible 
resistance developing in weed species, and also with weed species which are 
inherently tolerant to a particular product [for example, cleavers (Galium 
aparine L.) are not susceptible to Reflex T] and which can be problematic in 
individual fields. 
Although little disease pressure was encountered in the three experimental 
seasons reported here, research is needed into chemical control of potential 
diseases such as Pythium spp. and Ascochyta spp. These could be 
problematic if introduced through diseased seed and in years when 
conditions are conducive to infection and spread. 
A larger-scale genotype x environment performance study should be 
undertaken, using more sites (within the most suitable production areas) and 
a greater number of genotypes (including newer material). Furthermore, if 
lentil were to establish itself as a successful (albeit niche) UK crop, then 
attention should be focussed on breeding a UK ideotype conforming to the 
criteria outlined in Section 8.2. 
The effect that pre-winter plant population density has on modifying winter-
survival should be investigated at other environments, particularly those 
which are exposed (Le. at altitude) and at which lentil would experience a 
greater stress from cold. 
8.9 PRINCIPAL RESEARCH CONCLUSIONS 
Six cohorts of principal conclusions have emerged: 
1. Lentil can be produced successfully as a winter-sown crop in at least parts 
of the UK (southern and eastern England). The likely land area required to 
replace the current annual lentil import demand is approximately 6000 ha 
(at an average yield of 2.5 t ha -1 (at 10% m.c.), this area would supply the 
15 000 t which are imported annually}. 
2. Winter-survival is modified by plant population density. The response 
identified in 1996-97 was a consistent, but shallow relation between plant 
population density and winter-survival with an increase in survival of 10% 
when target density was increased from 50 to 200 plants m2 This effect is 
likely to be due to a modification of the crop microclimate (e.g. by 
increasing the air temperature within the stand). It is likely that a more 
clearly defined steeper relation might be observed under colder winters 
than the relatively mild winters experienced in this study. 
3. The optimum plant population density surviving in spring for optimum 
seed yield is between 100 and 120 plants mo2  The optimum sowing rate is 
therefore between 150 and 200 seeds mo2 , depending on seed bed and 
soil type, to allow for emergence losses, seedling mortality during the 
winter and to increase winter-survival compared to lower populations. The 
optimum population for seed yield coincides with the optimum 
population for maximum economic return because the yield-density 
relations are asymptotic. 
4. The most suitable genotype identified to date for production in UK is WA 
8649090. It shows good winter hardiness, good seed yield and quality 
coupled with excellent relative yield stability at various environments. 
Nevertheless, even with this genotype, heavy soils prone to waterlogging 
must be avoided. Fairly light, free draining soils are likely to be most suited 
to lentil production. Figure 8.1 (Appendix 8.2) shows the most suitable 
soil types for lentil cultivation, from which it is clear, that the majority of 
suitable areas falls within south and east England. There are likely to be 
well-drained lighter soils in the other soil-type areas which are not marked, 
but these should be assessed in greater detail. The areas marked in central 
Devon and Cornwall, whilst having suitable soil types, are unlikely to be 
successful production areas as annual rainfall is great within the south-
west (1200 - 2000 mm a" compared with 600 - 700 mm a" in the south 
and east of England). 
5. Lentil can be sown and harvested successfully using standard agricultural 
machinery, with minimum production losses of yield. 
6. Lentil production can increase the yield of a subsequent wheat crop and 
have a positive impact on the grain protein quality for breadmaking 
purposes. The impact of the carry-over effect of lentil crop on wheat yield 
arose through benefits to the wheat crop canopy, but it was not possible 
to identify benefits from the lentil to soil nitrogen content. 
Thus, the original general hypothesis that cold-hardy genotypes of lentil can 
survive winter in UK, come into flower after the danger of spring frost is past 
and mature in July to produce economically attractive yields of good quality 
seeds, with beneficial carry-over effects to subsequent wheat crops has been 
supported.
