The accelerator is called a non-scaling, Fixed Field Alternating
Gradient (ns-FFAG) accelerator, and will accelerate both protons and carbon ions to
energies required for clinical use. It is found that this
design is particularly sensitive to alignment errors and would be unable to accelerate
protons and carbon ions at the proposed acceleration rate due to betatron resonance
crossing phenomena.
