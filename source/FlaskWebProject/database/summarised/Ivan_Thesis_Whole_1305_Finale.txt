A potential solution is
the supplementation of diets with prebiotics: non-digestible carbohydrates which
improve growth and health by modulating gut microbiota to favour beneficial
bacteria. Six species of
underutilised legumes (adzuki beans, mung beans, black-eyed peas, pigeon peas,
Bambara groundnuts and red lentils) were used for starch isolation via alkaline
steeping, followed by processing involving enzyme or acid hydrolysis, and lastly
gelatinisation and retrogradation to increase RS yield.
