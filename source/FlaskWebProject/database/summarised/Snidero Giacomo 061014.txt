This thesis presents the measurement of the production cross section of a W bo-
son with a single charm quark in 7 TeV proton-proton collisions using the ATLAS
detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Typically, the strange quark density is considered to be suppressed
relative to that of the other light-quarks in the proton sea.
The measured cross section provides further constraint for the determination of
the strange quark density, advancing the knowledge of the fundamental structure
of the proton.
