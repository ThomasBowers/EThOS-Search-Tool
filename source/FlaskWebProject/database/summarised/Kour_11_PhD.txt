A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) studies the strong interaction part
(Quantum Chromo Dynamics) of the Standard Model at the CERN Large Hadron
Collider. ALICE has been designed as a general-purpose heavy-ion detector in order
to explore phenomena of strong interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma
(QGP) at extreme values of energy density and temperature in nucleus-nucleus
collisions.
