After motivating the requirement for a Monte
Carlo event generator, the principles and Physics behind such a generator are laid
Following this, the Monte Carlo tuning system Professor is used to give an assess-
ment of the uncertainty from tuning Herwig++ and the results from this analysis
used, along with a more accurate implementation of Higgs boson decays using the
POWHEG method, to determine the error associated with searching for the Higgs
boson with a jet substructure technique.
