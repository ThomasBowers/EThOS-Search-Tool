In addition to solving the hierarchy problem, a low
quantum gravity scale also oers the exciting prospect that collider experiments become
sensitive to the quantum nature of gravity. Quantum gravity signatures include missing
energy due to graviton emission, enhancement of standard model reference processes via
virtual graviton exchange, or the production and decay of mini black holes.
