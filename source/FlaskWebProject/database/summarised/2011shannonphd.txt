In this dissertation I describe a method for constructing virtual machines for dy-
namic languages, and explain how to design a virtual machine toolkit by building
it around an abstract machine. The Glasgow Virtual Machine
Toolkit automatically generates a just-in-time compiler, integrates precise garbage
collection into the virtual machine, and automatically manages the complex inter-
dependencies between all the virtual machine components.
