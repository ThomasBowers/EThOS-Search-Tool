Objective: To develop, test, and refine a theory-driven explanation of what supports hospital staff to
provide dementia-friendly care and with what outcomes for people living with dementia and their
carers.  When staff were allocated
time to spend with patients and drew on their knowledge of the patient with dementia and
dementia care skills, staff could provide care in ways that reassured patients and recognised their
personhood.
