Part
of the solution is achieved by integrating the best features of the previous EBL
programs, in the following manner:
identify the various types of control knowledge specified in EBL programs
to date,
analyse the learning techniques involved in these EBL programs,
develop an extended EBL approach which incorporates the best features of
these techniques and learns all these different types of control knowledge
This approach reflects a standard methodology of extending scientific knowledge
based upon a rational reconstruction of the fruits of previous research.
