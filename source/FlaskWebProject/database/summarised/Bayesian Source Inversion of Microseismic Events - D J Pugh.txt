Earthquakes either
occur naturally, such as in volcanic eruptions and natural geothermal fields, or are linked to
anthropogenic activities including hydrofracture of gas and oil reservoirs, mining events and
extraction of geothermal fluids. Two methods for estimating the posterior model
probability of the double-couple source type are explored, one using the Bayesian evidence,
the other using trans-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling.
