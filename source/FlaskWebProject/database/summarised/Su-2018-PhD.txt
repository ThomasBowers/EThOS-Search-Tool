Modelling dialogue management as a reinforcement learning task enables a system
to learn to act optimally by maximising a reward function.
First, a recurrent neural network-based predictor pre-trained from off-line data
is proposed to estimate task success during subsequent on-line dialogue policy
learning to avoid noisy user ratings and problems related to not knowing the users
goal.
