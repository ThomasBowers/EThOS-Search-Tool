The
energy distribution of the PFNS can be indicative of the material under
observation; the measurement of the energy spectrum of neutrons however is
notoriously difficult, due to the stochastic manner in which they interact with
radiation instrumentation.
This research has used a variety of the associated particle TOF
technique, to perform real time TOF spectrometry of fission nuclides with a
small-scale portable set up,  triggering on the  prompt fission gamma
emission.
