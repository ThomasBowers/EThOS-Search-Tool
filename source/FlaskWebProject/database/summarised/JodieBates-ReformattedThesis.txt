An important driver of zoonotic disease
is the pet trade; however, little is known about the presence of bacterial species
across publicly accessible surfaces within pet shops. This project aimed to i)
develop a DNA extraction method suitable for retrieving data from low-biomass
samples; ii) identify key bacterial zoonotic pathogens, referred to as target genera,
within the literature to provide a foundation for microbial community analysis; iii)
characterise bacterial communities associated with a range of surfaces - primarily
publicly accessible - within a pet shop; iv) characterise bacterial microbiota asso-
ciated with Python regius and feeder rodents within breeding farms in Africa; and
v) use the information gathered from the wider literature to infer the presence of
target genera within the pet shop and animal samples.
