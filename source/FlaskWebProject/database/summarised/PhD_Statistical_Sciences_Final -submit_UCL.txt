ETAS is a special case of the Hawkes
process - a self-exciting point process that provides the opportunity for a multilayered
intensity structure that addresses the rate of events as a function of previous events his-
tory. In this thesis we contribute primarily to three main aspects of a Hawkes
process - temporal, spatial and multivariate analyses.
