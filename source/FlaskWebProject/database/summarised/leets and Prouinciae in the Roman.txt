Whilst the significance of the contribution
made by Romes naval forces to her overseas military success has been widely recognised
by both ancient and modern historians, little attention has been paid to the important
questions of how, when and why the tasks of preparing and commanding the fleets were
actually assigned. It follows that the contributions that answers to these questions can
make to the wider debates concerning the functions of the Senate, the role and autonomy
of magistrates, the nature of the prouincia and even the conceptualisation of empire have
been largely overlooked.
