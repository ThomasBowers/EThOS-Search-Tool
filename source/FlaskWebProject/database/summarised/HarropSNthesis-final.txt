The purpose of the thesis is
to develop an approach that will equip clinicians and managers at implementation sites
to understand and comment critically but constructively, on the design, implementation
and evaluation of information systems, so they can promote the successful assimilation
of the National Programme for IT at their own place of work from a socio-technically-
informed position.
