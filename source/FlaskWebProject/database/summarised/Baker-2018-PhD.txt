We focus specifically on the cancer domain in terms of applications,
where we introduce two NLP classification tasks and datasets: the first task is that
of semantic text classification according to the Hallmarks of Cancer (HoC), which
enables text mining of scientific literature assisted by a taxonomy that explains the
processes by which cancer starts and spreads in the body.
