The
identification of the offending snake through venom analysis would allow for specific treatment to
be given minimising mortality and morbidity rates. The use of venom adsorbents yielded antivenoms capable of discriminating
the homologous venom from heterologous venoms in 'in vitro' tests both in buffer solutions and
when added to normal human serum In the conditions studied, species-specific venom
identification was independent of venom concentration and antivenom dilution.
