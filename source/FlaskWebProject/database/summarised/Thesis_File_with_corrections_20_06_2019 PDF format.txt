Chapter 1 utilises a large-scale replicated weathering field study in Neotropical
secondary forests in Panama rich in fixing legume trees demonstrating that N2-fixers
exerted 2-fold greater silicate rock weathering than non-fixers linked to significant
differences in soil acidity and belowground microbial community structure and
function.
Chapter 2 summarises our findings from another tropical system along a
secondary forest chronosequence in the Australian Wet Tropics, showing that N2-
fixing and ectomycorrhizal monodominant Acacia celsa drives greater P and K-
specific weathering dissolution from basalt silicate rocks throughout the
chronosequence. Analyses from chapters 1 and 2 employ
Next-Generation sequencing technology and omics-driven approach in demonstrating
a consistent effect of N2-fixing legume trees on their belowground microbiome in
tropical forests that is that high inputs of fixed N are a strong determinant in
functionally entraining the microbial community to high levels of mineral weathering. The
results from this chapter provide evidence for enhancements in acidification, soil
lithotrophy, microbial respiration and anaerobic metabolism in soil beneath N2-fixers
that may all converge in a second previously unrecognised ecosystem service carried
by N2-fixers: that of enhanced weathering and subsequent increase in available nutrient
stocks in such early successional systems.
