Prospective evidence is inconclusive regarding the protective effect of
high fibre intake on the risk of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Firstly, 14 commonly consumed legumes were analysed for fibre content using
the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) method, and the values
were significantly higher than published non-starch polysaccharide (NSP) values,
with a mean AOAC-fibre: NSP ratio of 1:1. There was no evidence of dose-response
relationships between T2DM risk and total fibre intake (AOAC-fibre and NSP) or
from key fibre sources, except an age-adjusted lower risk of T2DM with every
5g/day increment in cereal fibre (OR=0.
