Surface wave tomography is usually conducted using a two-step
method by first estimating two-dimensional (2D) surface wave phase or group
velocity maps at a series of frequencies and then inverting those for the 3D spatial
velocity structure through a set of 1D inversions for structure with depth beneath
each geographical location.
