Same- and opposite-sign charge asymmetries are measured in lepton+jets tt events in which a
b-hadron decays semileptonically to a soft muon, using data corresponding to an integrated lu-
minosity of 20. The charge asymme-
tries are based on the charge of the lepton from the top-quark decay and the charge of the soft
muon from the semileptonic decay of a b-hadron and are measured in a fiducial region corre-
sponding to the experimental acceptance.
