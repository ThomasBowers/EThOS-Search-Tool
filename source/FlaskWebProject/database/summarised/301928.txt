sown in autumn) was investigated as a
potential crop for the UK, given previous experience that spring-sown lentil
matures too late and so yields are small and unreliable and seed quality is
poor.
Increased plant population density improved winter-survival by 10% (from 88
to 97%) as target population increased from 50 to 200 plants m-2 Yield-
density relations were parabolic, with an optimum spring plant population
density for seed yield between 80 and 120 plants m-2 for both small- and
large-seeded genotypes.
