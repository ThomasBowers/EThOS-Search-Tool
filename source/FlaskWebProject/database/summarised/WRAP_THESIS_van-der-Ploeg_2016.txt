This thesis looks at the
impact of the Roman Empire on the cult, examining how Rome took over the
existing cult, the ways in which Rome influenced it, and the relationship between the
religion of Empire and local religion. Further chapters will each
examine a different aspect of the Roman impact on the cult, with the third focussing
on imperial influences and the worship of the god by Roman and provincial elites;
the fourth on how the Roman army influenced the cult; the fifth how multiple forms
of the god were worshipped side-by-side in North Africa.
