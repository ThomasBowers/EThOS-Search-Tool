In the central nervous system, small conductance calcium-activated potassium
channels (SK) are important for the generation of the afterhyperpolarisation that
follows single or trains of action potentials. Three SK channels have been cloned
(SKI, SK2 and SK3), which are selectively blocked by the venom toxin apamin and
present distinct pharmacological properties.
