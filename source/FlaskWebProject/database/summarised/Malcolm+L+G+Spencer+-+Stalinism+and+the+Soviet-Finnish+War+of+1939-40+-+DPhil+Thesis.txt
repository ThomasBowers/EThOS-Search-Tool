This thesis examines the extent to which the Soviet regime under Stalin had
the institutions and agents in place at the close of the 1930s to cope with the crisis of
war in Finland; to be in command of the military campaign, while simultaneously
controlling the direction of the official narrative about the fighting; and to censor
conflicting interpretations, experiences and information channels, which might expose
the Red Armys woeful performance on Finnish territory.
