This work proposes a novel reinforcement learning approach combined with the
universal function approximation capability of fuzzy systems within a
probabilistic fuzzy logic theory framework, where the information from the
environment is not interpreted in a deterministic way as in classic approaches but
rather, in a statistical way that considers a probability distribution of long term
consequences.
