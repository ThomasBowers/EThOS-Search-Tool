Super-
symmetry (SUSY) is an attractive potential solution to this problem, though the fact that
no supersymmetric particles have been discovered thus far raises fine tuning of most mod-
els to O(1%). The auto-concealment mechanism applies when the lightest ordinary super-
symmetric particle (LOSP), a brane localized state, promptly decays to the Kaluza-Klein
(KK) tower of a bulk lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP).
