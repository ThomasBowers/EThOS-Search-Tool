The simply shaped fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is
genetically tractable and undergoes a closed mitosis, making it a useful system in
which to probe mechanisms of nuclear size control. To identify molecular components and biological processes with roles in
nuclear size control mechanisms, a genetic screen for deletion mutants with
aberrant nuclear size and biochemical analysis of a nuclear size mutant are carried
out.
