We present the
application of energy landscape theory to the K-means cost function to elucidate its
topography, which we deduce from K-means landscapes described in terms minima
and transition states.
In all cases we observe that the cost function topography changes independently
of K-means accuracy; a dataset modification that increases clustering accuracy can
also make the cost function surface harder to explore.
