Here I show that beads
soaked in Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and placed in prospective flank of
chick embryos induce formation of ectopic limb buds, which contain their
own signaling regions and develop into complete limbs. If particular combinations of Hox gene expression determine
where wings and legs develop, then formation of additional limbs from flank
should involve changes in Hox gene expression which reflect the type of
limb induced.
