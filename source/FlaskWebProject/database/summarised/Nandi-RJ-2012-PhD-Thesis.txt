An exclusion of Gauge Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking at 95% confidence level is
made in the squark mass vs gluino mass parameter space using 1.1 fb1 of proton-proton
collisions data from the Large Hadron Collider. The event selection is based on the strong
production signature of photons, jets and missing transverse energy.
