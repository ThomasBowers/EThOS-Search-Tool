In recent years, and in an effort to resolve several of the issues surrounding
witness performance, the British Government have introduced a number of legislative
measures to improve performance at identity parades and enhance the court experience of
vulnerable witnesses and thereby improve the quality of their testimony.  Specifically, the data claim that sequential identity parades
significantly reduce the rate of false identifications from target absent parades whilst
preserving hit rates for target present parades.  The results of this study
revealed that there was no significant effect of parade presentation mode upon rates of
correct identifications for target present parades or the rate of mistaken identifications in
target absent parades.   However, when
tested in a deliberating jury group situation, all the Special Measures were associated with
the witness being perceived as more credible compared to the control condition, although
these differences were not significant, and there was no significant effect upon the rate of
guilty verdicts across all conditions.
