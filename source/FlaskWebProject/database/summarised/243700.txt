Venoms from the most poisonous snakes found in Saudi Arabia were assessed for their
physical and chemical characteristics and for their enzymatic and biological activities. To optimise the antibody response, groups
of sheep were immunised with a low, medium and high dose and the monthly bleeds
were assessed by ELISA and small-scale affinity chromatography.
