This study aims to investigate how lateral root (LR) and nodule
development are balanced in response to low (0.
The phenotypic measurements of root architecture of A17 in response to
NH4NO3 and rhizobia showed that at high NH4NO3 rhizobia affected LR
development. Whole genome profiling of early (2 and
6 hour) root responses to high NH4NO3 and rhizobia identified 4793 genes
that were differentially expressed (significance cutoff of P<0.
