This Thesis is devoted to the phenomenological analysis at the large hadron collider
(LHC), as well at a future electron positron collider, of the 4 dimensional (4D) composite
Higgs model (4DCHM), a compelling beyond the standard model scenario where the
Higgs state arises as a pseudo Nambu Goldstone boson. The motivations and the main
characteristics of the model are summarised and then an analysis of the gauge and Higgs
sectors of the 4DCHM is performed. Finally we propose a general framework for the
analysis of models with an extended quark sector that we have applied to a simplified
composite Higgs scenario.
