Next, I would like to thank my colleagues and the academic staff within the Centre for Doctoral
Training (CDT) for Communications, High Performance Networking (HPN) and the University of Bristol
in general for their continuous support and advice with specific thanks going to Anderson Bravalheri
from HPN, visiting Associate Professor Magnos Martinello from the Universidade Federal do Esprito
Santo and Professor Celio Trois from the Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.
