The study includes: the measurement of
permeability and seismic velocity anisotropy of heavily cataclased and altered fault rock, in
order to characterise the properties of the fault at the end of an interseismic period; the
microstructural and geochemical observations of carbonate-mineralised fractures within
the fault core / alteration zone, in order to better understand sealing processes and fluid-
rock interactions within heavily cataclased rock; and a study of the occurrence of frictional
melt and ultracataclasis within the fault, with focus on the inter-relations of these
processes as fault properties and fluid behaviour varies throughout the seismic cycle.
