The high energy physics community considers electron-positron linear col-
liders in order to complement the results obtained at the Large Hadron
Collider. This test facility has been studying this matter for more than 20
years, achieving two of its main goals: obtaining a stable beam size around
37 nm at the IP and an orbit stabilisation with a nanometer precision at
the IP.
