A search for new physics with non-resonant signals in dielectron and dimuon fi-
nal states in mass ranges above 2 TeV is presented. The data, corresponding to
an integrated luminosity of 139 fb1, were recorded by the ATLAS experiment
in protonproton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV during Run-2
of the Large Hadron Collider. The
benchmark signal model considered is the four-fermion contact-interaction,
which results in an enhancement of the dilepton event rate at the TeV mass
scale.
