We present an analysis of the properties of jets in protonproton and leadlead
collisions at the ALICE experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, using the
technique of two-particle angular correlations.
The jet width and transverse momentum imbalance, quantified by the jet fragmen-
tation transverse momentum jT and the net partonic transverse momentum kT re-
spectively, were studied in minimum bias proton collisions.
