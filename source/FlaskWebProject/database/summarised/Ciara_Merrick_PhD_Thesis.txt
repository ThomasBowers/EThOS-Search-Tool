This thesis argues the question of peace in Northern Ireland, and perhaps beyond, cannot be founded
on tolerance, equality, or mutual understanding among persons. Rather, I call for
an alternative starting point that holds the capacity to attend to the ethical encounters of peace always-
already respiring throughout the city of Belfast, Northern Ireland.
