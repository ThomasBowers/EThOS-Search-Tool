This study investigates the South African processes of conflict reconciliation (1990-98),
focusing on the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), the role of churches and the
lessons that South African experiences can offer to help resolve the ongoing crisis in
Rwanda (1990-2003). Even so, given the presence of a high proportion of Christians and a popular
traditional method of dispute settlement, there is a chance to find a combined and much
better model in Rwanda  involving church capacity and cultural means, and possibly a
third party  to respond effectively to the post-genocide situation.
