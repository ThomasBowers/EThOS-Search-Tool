This dissertation documents a study of very rare B-meson decays at the LHCb
experiment, using data taken during the first experiment run of the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) and during the second experiment run until September 2016.
The LHCb experiment was designed to test the Standard Model of particle physics
and to search for New Physics effects that go beyond the scope of the Standard Model
through the decay of b hadrons produced in high energy proton-proton collisions
at the LHC. The measurements described in this dissertation are made using data
samples of proton-proton collisions with integrated luminosities of 1.
The branching fractions of the very rare B0  + and B0s  + decays and
the effective lifetime of B0s  + decays are precisely predicted by the Standard
Model and are sensitive to effects from New Physics. New Physics processes could
influence the B0s  + branching fraction and effective lifetime independently,
and therefore the two observables are complementary.
