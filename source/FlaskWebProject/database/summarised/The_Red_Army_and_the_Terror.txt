This gutting of the officer corps created huge
turmoil inside the Red Army and affected at the very least 35,000 army leaders,
resulting in thousands of discharges, arrests and executions. Taking the
formation of the Red Army in early 1918 as its starting point, this thesis will argue that
the key to understanding Stalins attack on the officer corps in 1937 is to understand
how the military was perceived as susceptible to subversion.
