menopausal symptoms (VMS), as well as the risk of hormone-related cancers such as
ovarian, endometrial and breast cancer.
Methods: Two of the largest and most complete datasets in the world were used to
explore this topic: the UK Womens Cohort Study (UKWCS) and the International
collaboration for a Life course Approach to reproductive health and Chronic disease
