In a DCA scheme, instead of having a fixed frequency plan, all
channels are placed into a channel pool and potentially available to all the local
users [12-13]. DDCA schemes remove the control overhead required by the
CDCA schemes, but the behaviour of DDCA schemes is likely to be more selfish
than other approaches so that new activations may introduce excessive
interference to the existing transition links [20].
