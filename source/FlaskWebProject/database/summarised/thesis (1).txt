In the high energy environment of the Large Hadron Collider, there is a finite probability
for the longitudinal tail of the hadronic shower represented by a jet to leak out of the
calorimeter, commonly referred to as longitudinal hadronic shower leakage, or jet punch-
through. This thesis prescribes a method for identifying such punch-through jets via
the use of muon activity found behind a jet in the ATLAS muon spectrometer, finding an
occurance rate of up to 18% in the worst aected regions.
