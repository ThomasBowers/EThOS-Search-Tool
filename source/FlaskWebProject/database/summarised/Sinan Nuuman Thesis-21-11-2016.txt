This thesis proposes Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) as an improvement to
conventional reinforcement learning-based dynamic spectrum access used within cognitive
radio networks.
Review of research works on learning-based assignment techniques as well as quantum search
techniques is provided. The Grover search algorithm is combined as a decision making mechanism
with conventional Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms resulting in a more efficient
learning engine.
