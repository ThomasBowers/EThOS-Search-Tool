This thesis covers several optics issues and solutions applicable to the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC), its High Energy (HE-LHC) upgrade as well
as the Future Circular Collider (FCC-hh). A key tool presented in this
thesis is an optimisation method to produce short final focus triplets that
produce large integrated gradients whilst having an aperture sufficiently
large to sustain the beams and radiation shielding.
