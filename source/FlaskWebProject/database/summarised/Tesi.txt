The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, at which protons collide at un-
precedented center of mass energies and very high instantaneous luminosity, gives
unique possibilities for precise tests of the Standard Model and to search for new
physics phenomena.
This work consists in six public (PUB) notes: two on the MC modelling of V +jets
processes [1, 2], three on the MC modelling of the tt+jets process (with particular
emphasis on the implementation of new NLO merging schemes in the ATLAS
software) [35] and one about the inclusion of tt data recorded by the ATLAS
detector at 8 TeV (both lepton+jets and di-lepton decay channels) in a combined
PDF fit, together with the ep deep inelastic scattering data from HERA and the
inclusive ATLASW and Z boson data recorder at 7 TeV [6].
