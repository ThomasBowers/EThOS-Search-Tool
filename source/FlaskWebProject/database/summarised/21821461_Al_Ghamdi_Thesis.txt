The majority of the running time in the original K-Means algorithm
(known as Lloyds algorithm) is spent on computing distances from each data
point to all cluster centres to find the closest centre to each data point.
MapReduce, and its popular open-source implementation known as Hadoop,
provides a distributed computing framework that efficiently stores, manages, and
processes large-scale datasets over a large cluster of commodity machines.
