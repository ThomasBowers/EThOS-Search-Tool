This thesis documents the measurements of the W   (charged current Drell-Yan
Process) production cross section and the muon charge asymmetry. Experimental data and
Monte Carlo samples, from proton-proton collisions at a centre of mass energy of 13 TeV,
corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 44.
