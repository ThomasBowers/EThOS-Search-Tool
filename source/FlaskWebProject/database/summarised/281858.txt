A revision of the genus Entada was made using data from gross morphology, seed
and seedling morphology, palynology, anatomy and phytochemistry.
A study of seed morphology allowed delimitation of closely-related species in this
genus while seedling morphology enabled recognition of species even by first leaf
morphology.
