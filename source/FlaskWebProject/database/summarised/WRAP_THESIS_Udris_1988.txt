Whilst the Monty Python films (particularly Meaning of Life,
1983) and the ways in which they function remain of focal interest,
I have found myself drawn into a study of the history of manners, of
attitudes to the 'unclean', and of the origins of and developments
in notions of the grotesque; this historical/theoretical material
will constitute the first section of this thesis.
