With the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and no
signs of new physics to current date, precise theoretical predictions are of increasing
importance.
In this thesis, we extend the currently used methods to deal with heavy quarks
in hadron collision processes, the four-flavour and the five-flavour scheme, to con-
sistently include mass effects as well as resummation of collinear logarithms.
