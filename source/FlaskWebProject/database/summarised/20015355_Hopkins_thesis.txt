In order to increase the public approval of nuclear power as an alternative to fossil fuels,
developments in waste management of high-level liquid waste must be made. Removal of these fission products would reduce the radiotoxicity, the long-
term heat generation and the volume of high-level liquid waste enabling the simplification of
storage design for nuclear waste.
