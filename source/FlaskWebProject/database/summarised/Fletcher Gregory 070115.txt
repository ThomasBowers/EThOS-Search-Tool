ATLAS is a general purpose de-
tector designed to measure the products of such collisions, thereby allowing
scientists to explore a new and extremely rich physics programme. It is therefore imperative for searches for new physics
processes, and continued study of the Standard Model, to gain a comprehensive
understanding of quantum chromodynamics (QCD).
