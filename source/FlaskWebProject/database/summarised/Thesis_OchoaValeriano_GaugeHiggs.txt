It is possible to treat the Standard Model as an Effective Field Theory, valid up to
a high cut-off energy scale above the electroweak scale, equipped with a new set of
Lorentz structures, the so-called anomalous couplings, that extend and parametrise
with modified couplings the vertices allowed by the Standard Model.
