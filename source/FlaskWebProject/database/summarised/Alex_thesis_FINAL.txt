The relevant scale at which such phenomena occur, though
beyond the capacity of the human eye, can be followed by mechanical analysis
and mathematical models based on micro-structural evidence. First, it concerns the mechanism of cell
debonding, as this is key in explaining the softening of fruit and legumes dur-
ing storage or cooking, and is decisive for the perceived quality of food products.
