When Nod factor is added to legume root hair cells two calcium responses are
observed: a rapid influx of calcium in the root hair tip and periodic calcium oscillations in
and around the nuclear area. In order to
study whether root hair calcium spiking is essential for cortical nodule organogenesis,
Nod factor-induced calcium spiking was tested in the Lotus japonicus symrk14 har1-1
mutant.
