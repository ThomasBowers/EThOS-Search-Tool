We have purified,
partially sequenced and functionally characterised a serine protease, rhinocerase from the
venom of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros. To understand more about the sequence, structure and functional relationships of
viper venom serine proteases (VVSPs), all complete VVSP sequences have been extracted
from sequence database.
