Attempts to implement a system of client rulers were
unsuccessful, partly as a result of the competition between individual Berber leaders as they
sought to establish independent polities within the frontiers of the former Roman Empire; and
partly as a result of an increasing lack of resources, as well as the instability caused by
constantly changing leadership within the African civil and military administrations, which
prevented the development of coherent long term strategies for addressing the Berber threat.
