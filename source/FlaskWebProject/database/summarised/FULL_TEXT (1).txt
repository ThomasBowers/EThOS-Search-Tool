A search for heavy exotic diboson resonances decaying to ``qq final states is
presented using pp collision data collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large
Hadron Collider. No significant excess of data events over the predicted Standard Model
background is observed and 95% confidence level upper limits are set on the
product of the production cross-section and the branching ratio for spin-2 Kaluza-
Klein gravitons predicted by the bulk Randall-Sundrum model and for Extended
Gauge Model W  bosons.
