Relative to tectonic earthquakes, the recorded number of induced
earthquakes can be very small, while interventions to better record and prevent these
earthquakes make the use of stationary models either statistically inefficient or in-
appropriate. We investigate model
simplifications to ensure parsimony of the baseline model and explore model extensions
that assess the statistical evidence for additional physical characteristics that are not
currently represented.
