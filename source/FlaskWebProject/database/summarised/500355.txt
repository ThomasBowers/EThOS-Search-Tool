Because both the Rwandan Government and the international
community through the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda opted for prosecution of
alleged perpetrators responsible for the genocide, this thesis primarily considers this
prosecution process, its achievements and hardships. The Gacaca process particularly aims to disclose the truth of what happened in the
1994 Rwanda genocide, speed up genocide trials in an inexpensive manner, eradicate the
culture of impunity and lastly but by all means not least, reconcile and strengthen the
Rwandan people.
