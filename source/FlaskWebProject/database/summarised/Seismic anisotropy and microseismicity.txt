The plate tectonic cycle is fundamental to our dynamic Earth, encompassing the formation and
evolution of new lithosphere at divergent, mid-ocean ridges, all the way to its eventual return to,
and re-equilibration with, the mantle in subduction zones. I investigate the structure of the crust
and upper mantle of the Earth in two regions that represent different endmembers in this cycle
through the analysis of microseismicity and seismic anisotropy, seeking to learn more about the
stresses in these environments and how they are manifest in the structure of the subsurface. In
Iceland, new oceanic crust is accreted episodically within the volcanic rift zones that delineate the
subaerial portion of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the divergent margin between the North American and
the Eurasian plates. Northern Borneo, conversely, exhibits the tectonic signatures of not one but
two terminated subduction zones, where oceanic lithosphere was once being actively recycled into
the Earths mantle. As part of this work, I have helped to deploy and service two passive seismic
experimentsthe Cambridge Volcano Seismology network in Iceland and the northern Borneo
Orogeny Seismic Survey (nBOSS) network in Sabahfrom which I have derived my results.
