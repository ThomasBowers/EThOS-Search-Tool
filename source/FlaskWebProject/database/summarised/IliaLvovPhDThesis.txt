The emerging discipline
of social data science is subject to questions of epistemology, politics, ethics and
responsibility, while the practice of doing social data science raises significant
project management issues that include logistics, team communication, software
system integration and stakeholder engagement. Using the ethnographic findings and the basic content and
structure of the SEMAT model, I develop the Social Science Scorecard Deck  an
agile project management tool for social data science.
