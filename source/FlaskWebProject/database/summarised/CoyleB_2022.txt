We focus our attention towards heuristic algorithms of a variational
(meaning hybrid quantum-classical) nature, using parameterised quantum circuits
as the underlying quantum machine learning model.
Firstly, we study a variational quantum classifier in supervised machine learning,
and focus on how (classical) data, feature vectors, may be encoded in such models
in a way that is robust to the inherent noise on NISQ computers.
