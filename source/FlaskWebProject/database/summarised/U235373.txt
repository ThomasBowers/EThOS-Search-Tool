However, both the crisis and collapse of the Soviet system have led to a reconsideration of the
fundamental theoretical grounds upon which the practices of the Leninist-Stalinist state were
premised. I challenge such a thesis by arguing that Leninism-Stalinism
was an autholitarian (both authoritarian and totalitarian) system which, like Hobbess
sovereign, was concerned more with the consolidation of the state rather than 'smashing it.
