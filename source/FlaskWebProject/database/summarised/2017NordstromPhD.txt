In this thesis we
will present studies into the Large Hadron Collider phenomenology of dark matter
inspired extensions to the Standard Model, di-Higgs + 2 jet (hhjj) production, CP
violating effects in the Higgs sector, and the use of shape information from top
polarisation measurements in searches for new physics.
