The Standard Model of particle physics is discussed with emphasis on light quark QCD,
and existing data on light quark fragmentation from e+e annihilation and deep inelastic
scattering experiments.
A method is developed to measure the directionally correlated pionic scaled momen-
tum distribution, or partonic fragmentation function, in large hadron collider conditions.
