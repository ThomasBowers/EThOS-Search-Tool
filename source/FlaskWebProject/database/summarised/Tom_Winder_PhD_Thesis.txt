Furthermore, recent advances in methods and algorithms for calculating precise
relative locations for large numbers of small earthquakes allows for these faults and structures to be
imaged in exquisite detail, and to gain a deeper understanding than by studying only their temporal
occurrence.
In Chapter 3 I outline the collection of seismic data in Iceland, the pre-processing
procedures applied, and the application of QuakeMigrate to generate a highly complete
and robust earthquake catalogue for the region around Askja volcano, in the Northern
Volcanic Zone of Central Iceland.
