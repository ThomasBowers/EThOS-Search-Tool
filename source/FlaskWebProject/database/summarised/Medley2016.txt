Therefore understanding high energy perturbative quantum chromody-
namics (QCD) at these experiments is essential not only as a test of the Standard Model,
but also because these processes form the dominant background to many searches
for new physics. This calculation adds to the fixed-
order accuracy the dominant logarithms in the limit of large partonic centre-of-mass
energy to all orders in the strong coupling s.
