By clarifying the origin of the Korean War in depth with underused
historical resources released from Russia, China, North Korea and the US government, this
thesis will help historians, as well as the Korean public, to resolve their misunderstanding of
this war that has created tensions in the Korean Peninsula over the past six decades. The documents which were used in this
thesis were obtained in various ways; Firstly, the Russian Federation Presidential Archives and
Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' External Policy Archives decided to provide Russian
government's historical documents, 548 pages for 216 cases, related to the Korean War to the
Republic of Korea in June 1994, and those documents were stored in the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs in the ROK.
