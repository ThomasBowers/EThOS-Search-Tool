Background information, radiation-matter interactions and their descriptions
as nuclear data are discussed before an introduction to several useful methods in nuclear
analyses. This
analysis uses Total Monte Carlo sampling of nuclear parameters to determine the spread in
Tritium Breeding Ratio (TBR) values for the proposed DEMO reactor, due to uncertainty in
our knowledge of neutron interactions with the lead nucleus.
