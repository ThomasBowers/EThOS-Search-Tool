There is strong motivation to study standard model physics using the highest-
energy data provided by the Large Hadron Collider. This thesis introduces a novel algorithm which aims to
reconstruct partons outgoing from hard interactions, prior to any splitting,
by concentrating solely on the highest momentum transfer scale.
