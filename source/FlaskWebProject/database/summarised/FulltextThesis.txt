This thesis examines foreshock and aftershock seismicity patterns with the accelerated
seismic release model and the non-extensive statistical physics approach in the South
Aegean. This method uses a power law
equation to quantify the cumulative energy release (or Benioff strain, or number events)
from the earthquakes that occur before the large event.
