A calibration curve for the determination of separation cut size for
17 settings of the air classifier, was derived from Coulter counter
particle-size analysis of matched pairs of fines and coarse fractions.
The crude fibre content of the fines was significantly lower than
the whole flourfor fababean and pigeonpea, but not for cowpea, whereas,
the indications were, that hemicellulose fractionated into the fines of
all the air-classified legume flours, excepting one variety of pigeonpea.
