The research presented in this thesis aims to augment the conventional kinematic-based
parallel robot workspace determination into an interactive 3D visual system by
highlighting the design issue clearly and providing important design information to the
user in real-time. The conventional iteration involves heavy computation, high resolution
data processing and multiple technical skills set which usually reduce the design option
into amending an existing design most related to the requirement.
