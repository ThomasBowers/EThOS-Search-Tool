The thick and seismically fast Precambrian continental remnants (cratons) provide fundamental clues
about the tectonic processes that operated on the early Earth. Eastern Canada is a natural laboratory
to study such processes: its geological record spans more than 3Ga of Earth history, including the
assembly of the largest Archean craton in the world, the Superior craton, which is surrounded by
global scale Proterozoic and Phanerozoic orogenic belts.
