They can take the form of
either dramatic radio jets, which extend vast distances into the inter-galactic medium,
or of much smaller scale winds - whose existence can be inferred only indirectly via their
influence on the observed spectra. The clearest observational signature comes in the form of the broad,
blue-shifted absorption features seen in the spectra of broad absorption line quasars
(BALQSOs) and the aim of this work is to investigate how the geometry and physical
parameters of disk winds affect their absorption spectra.
