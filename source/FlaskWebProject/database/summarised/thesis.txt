The success of machine learning is due in part to the effectiveness of
scalable computational methods, like stochastic gradient descent or Monte
Carlo methods, that undergird learning algorithms. It introduces a new method for gradient estimation in discrete
variable models, a new objective for maximum likelihood learning in the
presence of latent variables, and two new gradient-based differentiable
optimization methods.
