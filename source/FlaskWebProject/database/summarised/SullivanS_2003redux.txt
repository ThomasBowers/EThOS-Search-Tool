A murine cell hybrid system was established and optimised to study nuclear reprogramming of somatic cells via fusion with embryonic stem cells.
Moderate heat shocking of thymocytes prior to fusion with ES cells resulted in increased
reprogrammed hybridisation frequencies but as fusion was also increased it was
impossible to verify whether an increase in nuclear reprogramming was partly
responsible.
