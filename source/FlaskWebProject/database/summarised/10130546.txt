Proton beam writing is a direct write lithographic technique that uses finely focused MeV
proton beams to create structures in a target material.
This thesis is a study of the application of FEW in creating Micro Electro-Mechanical
Systems (MEMS) in a polymer SU 8 and SU 8 polymer nano composite with silver, and
shows experimental steps, theoiy and computer simulations involved in creating an
electrostatic actuated micro-gripping device.
