The ferlins are mammalian homologues of the C-elegans sperm vesicle fusion protein FER-1
characterised by multiple C2 domains and a C-terminal anchor. The role of
FER1L5 in muscle membrane fiision was investigated by examining the fusion index and
membrane repair ability of C2C12 cells following PERILS inhibition.
