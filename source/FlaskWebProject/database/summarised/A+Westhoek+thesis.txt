Application of inoculant rhizobial
strains is common practice in many areas, as plant growth is often nitrogen limited and
the symbiosis can significantly enhance yields.
Mathematical modelling was used to predict how plants should allocate resources
to maximise growth rates, depending on rhizobial nitrogen provision and carbon
requirements and on soil nitrogen conditions.
