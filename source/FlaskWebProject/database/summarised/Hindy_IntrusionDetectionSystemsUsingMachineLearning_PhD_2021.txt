The ever-evolving technological landscape of interconnected
devices constantly expands the network attack surface, which has contributed to the
number and complexity of cyber attacks in recent years. To cope with the increased rate and complexity of cyber
attacks, researchers have utilised Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)
techniques to develop IDS to cope with new and zero-day attacks.
