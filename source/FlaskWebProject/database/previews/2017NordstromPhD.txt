"Phenomenology for the Large Hadron Collider"
The search for physics Beyond the Standard Model is the underlying motivation for
the physics programme of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. In this thesis we
will present studies into the Large Hadron Collider phenomenology of dark matter
inspired extensions to the Standard Model, di-Higgs + 2 jet (hhjj) production, CP
violating effects in the Higgs sector, and the use of shape information from top
polarisation measurements in searches for new physics.
Full scans of the parameter space of Simplified Dark Matter models are demon-
strated to be viable and allow for intriguing comparisons to relic density constraints.
Strongly self-interacting dark sectors are shown to leave a potentially measurable
imprint on the energy scaling of mediator production. The weak boson fusion in-
duced production of hhjj turns out to be sensitive to a number of new physics
effects, including CP violation in the Higgs sector. The use of top polarisation mea-
surements to discover new physics which predicts polarised resonances is shown to
be an effective way to ameliorate the loss of shape information for kinematically
challenging regions of parameter space.
