Design of a Non-Scaling Fixed Field Alternating
This thesis describes the design a novel type of particle accelerator for charged
particle therapy. The accelerator is called a non-scaling, Fixed Field Alternating
Gradient (ns-FFAG) accelerator, and will accelerate both protons and carbon ions to
energies required for clinical use. The work is undertaken as part of the PAMELA
project.
An existing design for a ns-FFAG is taken as a starting point and analysed in terms
of its ability to suit the charged particle therapy application. It is found that this
design is particularly sensitive to alignment errors and would be unable to accelerate
protons and carbon ions at the proposed acceleration rate due to betatron resonance
crossing phenomena.
To overcome this issue, a new type of non-linear ns-FFAG is developed which
avoids resonance crossing and meets the requirements provided by clinical consid-
erations. Two accelerating rings are required, one for protons up to 250 MeV and
fully stripped carbon ions to 68 MeV/u, the other to accelerate the carbon ions up to
400-430 MeV/u. Detailed studies are undertaken to show that this new type of accel-
erator is suitable for the application. An alignment accuracy of 50m will not have
a detrimental effect on the beam and the dynamic aperture for most lattice configu-
rations is found to be greater than 50mm mrad normalised in both the horizontal
and vertical plane.
Verification of the simulation code used in the PAMELA lattice design is carried
out using experimental results from EMMA, the worlds first ns-FFAG for 10-20 MeV
electrons built at Daresbury Laboratory, UK.
Finally, it is shown that the described lattice can translate into realistic designs for
the individual components of the accelerator. The integration of these components
into the PAMELA facility is discussed.
This thesis is dedicated to Bill, whose life was tragically cut short by
cancer in 2010.
