Narratives of Nurses Working in Intensive Care 
Rationale and aims: The COVID-19 pandemic  is thought  to be the greatest
challenge the United Kingdom (UK)s intensive care units (ICUs) have faced. The
literature on experiences of nurses working during the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly
evolving. However, there appears to be a scarcity of research on how nurses who
worked in ICUs during the pandemic construct their experiences and identities,
within social, cultural and political contexts.
Methodology: A qualitative approach, specifically narrative inquiry, was employed to
explore the accounts of six nurses, all of whom worked in an ICU during the COVID-
19 pandemic. The nurses were both ICU-trained nurses and redeployed nurses from
other departments, recruited from a specialist cardiothoracic hospital. Nurses were
interviewed individually using a semi-structured format. The content and structure of
their narratives were analysed, with attention to performative and contextual aspects
and the construction of narrative identity.
Analysis: Nurses constructed rich, multi-layered narratives, enhancing the existing
literature. Three broad stories were observed across the accounts: 1. It came with
like a bang, 2. Working in the red zone, and 3. Looking back, looking forward.
Nurses faced a multitude of morally challenging situations, including an inability to
provide the usual standard of care, lack of adequate personal protective equipment
(PPE), and faced the danger of contracting the virus and fears of infecting others.
The analysis highlighted that the nurses worked to construct credible narratives that
conveyed the difficulties they encountered. This particularly can be seen within the
broader contention relating to the existence of the pandemic, despite being depicted
as heroes by society, the Government and the media. Clinical implications and
future research suggestions are proposed.
