Proton beam writing is a direct write lithographic technique that uses finely focused MeV
proton beams to create structures in a target material. The depth the protons travel in a
material is dependent on its energy, this unique property of proton beams allow multi level
stiTictures to be created in materials.
FEW has been demonstrated successfully on semiconductor materials, glass and polymers.
This thesis is a study of the application of FEW in creating Micro Electro-Mechanical
Systems (MEMS) in a polymer SU 8 and SU 8 polymer nano composite with silver, and
shows experimental steps, theoiy and computer simulations involved in creating an
electrostatic actuated micro-gripping device.
Proton beam writing in silver SU 8 composite results in the creation of electrically
conducting microstructures. The unique predictability of the range of protons in materials is
leveraged in the creating of free standing conducting cantilevers structures which are used as
the building blocks for a micro gripping device. The electrostatic actuation has been modelled
using a finite element modelling software Sugar 3.1, and the results are comparable with
actual actuations in a realized micro-gripping device.
