This thesis describes the large-time behaviour of partial differential equations by
studying their similarity solutions. The aim of this work is to try to extend the
known theory for the heat equation and the semilinear heat equation to more
complicated models. The particular models considered are as follows:
(i) We consider the porous medium equation (PME)
ut =  A (|u |m-1u) in R^ x R+, u(x, 0) =  u(x) in R ^,
with continuous, compactly supported initial data u. The PME admits various
similarity solutions of the form Uk{x,t) =  t~akipk{x/t^k), k =  0 ,1 ,2 ,__  The
nonlinear eigenfunction subset $  =  {ipk} is shown to be evolutionary complete,
i.e. describes the asymptotics of arbitrary global Co-solutions of the PME. This
evolution completeness holds in one dimension and in radial geometry in R ^ .
(ii) We consider the PME with absorption
ut =  Aum  up in R^ x R+, with m ,p  > 1.
It is known that its global L l -solutions change their large-time behaviour at the
critical absorption exponent p0 = m  +  -j . We extend this by showing that, pro
vided u(x,t )  changes sign, there exists an infinite sequence of critical exponents
{pk} that generate a countable subset of different non-self-similar asymptotic
patterns. These results are extended to the dual PME with absorption
ut =  |A u|m-1Au  \u\p~lu in R^ x R+, with m  > 1.
(iii) We consider the semilinear parabolic equation of reaction-diffusion type
ut =  (A )mu + \u\p~lu in R N x  R+, with exponents p > l ,m  > 2
and initial data u  L q(RN)} q > 1. This is an extension of the semilinear heat
equation that is known to exhibit non-uniqueness for p > 1 4- We show that
non-uniqueness occurs for the higher order parabolic equations if p > 1 +  ^  by
describing a discrete subset of similarity solutions u*(x,t) = t~1 p~1 V (x / t 1 2m).
We also establish the existence of radially symmetric similarity profiles for p
close to the bifurcation exponents pi =  1 +  I =  0 ,2 ,. . . ,  and prove that the
p-bifurcation branches remain in the range p < ps = {M-2m)+
