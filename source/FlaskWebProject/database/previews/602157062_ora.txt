Perceptions of Justice, Identity, and Political Processes of
This thesis offers an alternative way to reframe issues and questions that have plagued
peace processes during post conflict transitions throughout the 1990s and beyond. This
framework, derived from a survey of relevant literature, observation, and fleldwork
interviews in Northern Ireland, Serbia, and South Africa, examines perceptions of justice,
formation of identity, and political processes of forgiveness and revenge in post conflict
transitions. This thesis is organised into three sections; Issues and Concepts: Chapters
One to Three, Country Background: Chapters Four to Six, and the Conclusion: Chapters
Seven and Eight. In the first section, Chapter One depicts perceptions of justice as
fairness as a strong and underlying motivation for formation of identity and processes of
forgiveness and revenge. Chapter Two focuses on issues of post-conflict identity and the
claim to victimisation by all groups formerly in conflict. Chapter Three demonstrates
how these concepts interact with and motivate evolutionary, parallel, and entwined
political processes of forgiveness and revenge in post conflict transitions. The concluding
section explores the problems of violence during peace processes, in Chapter Seven; and
proposes some alternative ways for the international community to approach
peacekeeping and aid conditionality. A key finding of this thesis is that a willingness for
all individuals and groups to practice forbearance from revenge, rather than unconditional
forgiveness, is the strongest factor directly impacting political, social, and economic
relationships between former enemies. Seen as a mid phase between processes of
forgiveness and revenge, this "passive resentment", where a decision to forbear from
enactment of revenge has been consciously taken, has emerged as a key factor for
moving political cooperation and reforms forward.
