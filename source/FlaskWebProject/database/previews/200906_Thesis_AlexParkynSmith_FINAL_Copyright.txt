Making sense of change: An urban ethnography of
An urban ethnography of middle-class narratives of uncertainty
in Almaty, Kazakhstan
Alexander James Parkyn-Smith
This urban ethnography focuses on the new generation of young urban middle-class
people in Almaty, Kazakhstan, who have grown up after the Soviet Union. It examines
how they respond to the dramatic social, economic, political, and environmental
changes their country has undergone since 1991. A close analysis of their distinct way
of life, in comparison to both their parents generation and the wider public, provides an
insight into the social strategies they employ to make sense of change in the context of
their everyday lives. This research, based on fieldwork carried out between 2014 and
2017, is an original study, addressing the question: How do Almatys urban middle-
class population make sense of change?
I argue that young urban middle-class people in Almaty, Kazakhstan perform a public
narrative of their lives, providing their everyday existence with a sense of structure,
stability, and coherence in the face of past societal change and the risk of further change
in the future. However, ruptures in everyday lifesuch as a flood, earthquake, currency
devaluation, or even a marriageexpose vulnerabilities of this young generation that
are only discussed in private contexts. To overcome their growing uncertainty about the
reliability of public narratives, my informants increasingly rely on their trusted social
relations of kinship and friendship networks. When these channels are exhausted, my
informants turn to alternative discursive techniques, such as rumour, to discuss private
concerns in public contexts without undermining their own public narratives.
