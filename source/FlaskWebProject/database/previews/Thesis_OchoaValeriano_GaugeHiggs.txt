Constraining anomalous couplings in the gauge-Higgs
Several physical phenomena suggest that the Standard Model is not the ultimate
theory possible for describing Nature, and looking for deviations from the theory
prediction might be a hint for physics beyond the Standard Model. Nevertheless,
the lack of tantalising evidence for new resonant physics, along with our ignorance
of the energy scale at which such physics should arise, require us to improve current
precision measurements to further test the Standard Model.
It is possible to treat the Standard Model as an Effective Field Theory, valid up to
a high cut-off energy scale above the electroweak scale, equipped with a new set of
Lorentz structures, the so-called anomalous couplings, that extend and parametrise
with modified couplings the vertices allowed by the Standard Model. The interactions
between the Higgs and the gauge bosons are thought to be a promising avenue to
scrutinise the Standard Model for any new physics effects.
In this Thesis we explore the gauge-Higgs sector to segregate the anomalous couplings
that arise in viewing the Standard Model as an Effective Field Theory. In doing so,
we investigate the capability of current and future experiments at constraining said
anomalous couplings through standard processes involving gauge-Higgs interactions
that might shed light on what potentially lies beyond the Standard Model.
We study the so-called golden channel in the environment of the High-Luminosity
Large Hadron Collider, as well as the Higgs-strahlung and Z-boson fusion processes
at the high-energy stages of both the International Linear Collider and the Compact
Linear Collider. These channels allow us to project stringent bounds on anomalous
couplings in the gauge-Higgs sector that can be probed at high-energy colliders.
