A search for the electroweak production of charginos and neutralinos decaying into
final states involving three electrons or muons is presented. The analysis is based on
36.1 fb 1 of s=13TeV protonproton collisions recorded by the ATLAS detector
at the Large Hadron Collider. Scenarios considered are based on simplified models
with the associated production of the next-to-lightest neutralino and the lightest
chargino, followed by their decays into final states with leptons and the lightest
neutralino via either sleptons or Standard Model gauge bosons. No significant
deviations from Standard Model expectations are observed and stringent limits at
95% confidence level are placed on the masses of relevant supersymmetric particles.
For a massless lightest neutralino, masses up to 1.13TeV are excluded for the
associated production of the next-to-lightest neutralino and the lightest chargino,
assuming slepton mediated decays, whereas for gauge-boson-mediated decays, masses
up to 380GeV are excluded.
