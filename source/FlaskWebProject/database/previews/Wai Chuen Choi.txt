In carnivorous fish farming industry, there are progressive increase demands for
the finite resource of fish meal. A potential alternative to fish meal is to use
legume meals which are free of enzyme inhibitors. In selected underutilised
legumes the most effective processing method for eliminating trypsin (TIA),
chymotrypsin (CIA) and -amylase (AIA) inhibitors, without affecting the crude
protein content, was investigated. These methods included soaking (S), wet
heating (W), autoclaving (A) and dry freezing (D). No single method was effective
at removing all the inhibitors. In all legumes tested, the combined processing
methods which involved A were most effective in reducing CIA and AIA (p<0.05),
but not TIA. However, in adzuki bean both TIA and CIA were reduced by the D+A
combined method (p<0.05), whereas AIA of soybean and adzuki bean was
decreased by combined methods of S+A (84.7 % and 99.3 % reduction
respectively, p<0.05) or A+D (99.1 % and 72.6 % reduction respectively, p<0.05).
All the processing methods retained 86.5  90.5 % of crude protein. Replacement
of 10 % (w/w) of fish meal with D+A treated legume meal (either bambara
groundnut or adzuki bean) for 28 days showed no significant difference in growth
performance or inflammatory effects in Danio rerio or Lates calcarifer. Compared
to Lates calcarifer given feed containing unprocessed adzuki bean meal, those on
feed containing processed adzuki bean meal had increased hepatic gene
expression of alanine aminotransferase (p<0.01), indicating an enhanced ability to
utilise amino acids. The project identified specific food processing methods which
are effective at removing enzyme inhibitors in legumes, thereby facilitating the
application of legumes as aquafeed ingredients. Future studies are required to
examine what inclusion level of treated legume meal can promote growth
performance in specific commercial fish species.
