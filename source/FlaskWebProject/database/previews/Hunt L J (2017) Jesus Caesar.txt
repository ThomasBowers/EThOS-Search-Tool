Microsoft Word - Jesus Caesar Final hardbound version
Latin use in inscriptions shows evidence of intersections between Roman and Greek
languages and culture during the first century CE. Although the provenance for the Gospel
of John is not definitively determined, this evidence is present in each proposed location as
well as in the text of the Gospel itself (e.g.,  in 18:28, 33 and 19:9). This suggests,
based on Umberto Ecos semiotics, that the Roman cultural encyclopaedia could shed light
on the Gospel of John, particularly in the Roman trial narrative for a Roman-aware audience.
Some words in particular intersect with important Roman concepts: , ,
and . The phrase    in John 19:5, when analysed from a Roman
perspective, seems sufficiently close to hic vir, hic est from Vergils Aeneid (6.791) to mark
it as a literary allusion. An exegetical analysis of John 18:2819:22, the passages most
imprinted with Latin words and Roman concepts, reveals a Roman Pilate who tests the
loyalty of both Jesus and the Jews to Caesar. This exegesis, furthermore, provides the data
for a social-scientific reading of the passage which constructs a superordinate identity for
Romans (and, although outside the main focus of this thesis, for Jews as well). It also
conveys a hidden transcript that creates honour for the marginalized Jesus-believers and calls
those with power to become vulnerable for the sake of Gods empire. Although others have
looked at empire in the Gospel of John, and some have made connections between specific
verses and the Roman cultural encyclopaedia (e.g., 19:2), no one has noted the literary
allusion in 19:5 nor offered an in-depth and sustained Roman reading of the trial narrative.
