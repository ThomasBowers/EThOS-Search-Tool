Death Metal: Characterising the eects of
The use of lead was ubiquitous throughout the Roman Empire, including as material for
water pipes, eating vessels and as a sweetener for wine. Children are particularly
susceptible to the effects of lead and it is likely that the widespread use of this deadly
metal amongst Roman populations led to a range of adverse health effects. Indeed, lead
poisoning has even been implicated in the downfall of the Roman Empire. This research
examines the direct effect of lead poisoning on the inhabitants of the Empire, and for
the first time introduces a bioarchaeological perspective to how lead exposure affected
health during the Roman period. The results provide strong evidence that Roman lead
pollution contributed to the high prevalence of metabolic diseases during childhood and
implicates elevated lead burdens in the high prevalence of infant remains in Roman
skeletal assemblages.
This study has also shown the effectiveness of lead isotope analysis as a tool in
archaeological migration studies. The successful establishment of baseline lead isotope
ranges in previously unstudied regions of the Roman Empire has greatly enhanced our
ability to identify the potential origins of isotopic outliers. Although this study has
shown that anthropogenic lead isotope ratios are not country specific, the results have
demonstrated that lead isotope ratios can differentiate between populations based on the
orogenic age of the region in which an individual spent their childhood. This has
improved our understanding of how anthropogenic lead isotope ratios in Roman
individuals varies across a continent, and has demonstrated that lead isotope ratios are
capable of discriminating between geographical regions of origin when other isotope
system are not.
