Measurement of the inclusive jet cross section with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider
This thesis presents the measurement of the inclusive jet cross section using
data collected in 2010 by the ATLAS detector, with a particular focus on the
reconstruction and calibration techniques used for jets in this measurement
and on the estimate of the systematic uncertainty on their energy scale. The
inclusive jet cross section measurement is used as input to fits of parton
distribution functions. Although the PDF analysis in this thesis is preliminary
and its main purpose is to serve as a proof of principle for future studies,
improvements in the knowledge of the gluon density are observed thanks to
the inclusion of ATLAS data.
