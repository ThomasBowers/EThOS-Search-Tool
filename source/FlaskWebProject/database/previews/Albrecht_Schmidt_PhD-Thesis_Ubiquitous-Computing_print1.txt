Microsoft Word - Albrecht Schmidt PhD-Thesis Ubiquitous Computing - Computi.
Research in Ubiquitous Computing has arrived at a crossroad: A point of convergence
where a technology proliferated environment meets with the ability of people to
interact with, and make use of, the possibilities that this technology creates.
Advances in the various fields of technology allow us to create artefacts and
environments that provide computing and communication resources. The
understanding of how humans will interact and make use of such systems is however
largely unresolved and often not addressed in current research. A key to
understanding such systems and their use is the observation that humans implicitly
interact in context with their environments including technology.
The task of making this context information available to components in computer
systems has become a prerequisite to advancing human-computer interaction
processes in Ubiquitous Computing. Context awareness, or more specifically how to
create applications that are context aware, is a central issue to Ubiquitous Computing
research. Such research raises questions on context acquisition, context
representation, distribution and abstraction, as well as programming paradigms,
development support, and implications on human-computer interaction in general.
The research presented in this thesis concentrates on some of these issues. First the
question of how to acquire context in a Ubiquitous Computing environment using
