How does the book of Revelation interact with the empire?
This question has driven much of the scholarly interest in the Apocalypse of
John over the past 125 years.  Engaged directly and indirectly, it motivates
intertextual explorations (both in the Old Testament and Graeco-Roman documents),
historical inquiries, and sociological investigations.  While the question is rarely
stated, it, nevertheless, guides considerations and conclusions for the multilayered
imagery in the text of Revelation as well as examinations and determinations about
the socio-historical setting of the texts audiencethose that sit just beyond what is
written.  Regardless of the scholarly trajectory, the history of research for the
Apocalypse of John persistently engages this key question: How does Revelation
interact with the empire?1
Similar queries dominate the broader biblical scholarship in recent Empire
Studies in the disciplines of Paul and Jesus.2  To match these projects, the question
is, at times, rephrased: How does Paul interact with the empire? or How does
Jesus interact with the empire?  The advances of Empire Studies in Paul and Jesus
have reinvigorated the imperial inquiry into the Apocalypse of John.  Though not
always acknowledged, Revelation research over the past 125 years has struggled
with this question that now arises afresh: How does Revelation interact with the
empire?

apparent on the surfacethe latent connections, the hidden structures, and the invisible systems of
