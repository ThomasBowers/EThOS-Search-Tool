The Western historiography of Stalin and Stalinism produced in the period 1925
to the present day is a strikingly varied body of work in which the nature of
Stalin, his regime and his role within his regime have been and continue to be the
subject of debate. This characteristic is all the more striking when we consider
that from the earliest years of the period under study there has been a general
understanding of the nature of the Stalinist regime, and of the policies and leader
which have come to define it.
This thesis analyses the principal influences on research which have led to
this body of work acquiring such a varied nature, and which have led to an at
times profoundly divided Western, and more specifically Anglo-American,
scholarship. It argues that the combined impact of three key formative influences
on research in the West over the period of study, and their interaction with each
other, reveal recurring themes across the whole historiography, while also
accounting for the variety of interpretations in evidence. The first impact
identified is the lack of accessibility to sources during the Soviet period, which
posed a constant and real obstacle to those in the West writing on Stalin and
Stalinism, and the impact of the removal of this obstacle in the post-Soviet era.
The second is the influence of wider historiographical trends on this body of
work, such as the emergence of social history. Finally the thesis argues that
evolving Western attitudes to Stalin and Stalinism over this period have played a
key role in constructions of Stalin and his regime, demonstrating an on-going
historical process of the othering of Russia by the West. The extent and nature of
this othering in turn provide a central line of enquiry of the thesis. Tightly
intertwined with all three impacts has been the changing global political context
over the period in question which provides the evolving and influential contextual
backdrop to this study, and which has given this body of work a deeply political
and personal character.
