This thesis documents the measurements of the W   (charged current Drell-Yan
Process) production cross section and the muon charge asymmetry. Experimental data and
Monte Carlo samples, from proton-proton collisions at a centre of mass energy of 13 TeV,
corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 44.3 fb1 are utilised; the data presented
was recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider during the year 2017.
The measurements are performed differentially in muon pseudorapidity || and are within
the W boson invariant mass in a kinematic fiducial volume of muon and neutrino transverse
momentum p
T > 30 GeV and muon pseudorapidity || < 2.4. The fiducial measurements
uncertainties are below 2% empowering these measurements to constrain the modelling of
the proton composition.
