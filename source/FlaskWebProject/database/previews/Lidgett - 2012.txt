The overall objective of this thesis was to develop a methodology for
predicting the high strain rate properties of macro scale polymer composite
materials through micro and meso scale finite element modelling.
The focus in this study was on multi-layered multi-material polymer
composite laminates consisting of 0/90 and  45 layers of either; S2
Glass/Epoxy or Carbon/Epoxy non crimp fabric.
A multi-scale finite element modelling methodology was developed at the
micro and meso scale for predicting the elastic response, damage initiation,
damage evolution and strain rate dependence of macro scale polymer
composite materials.  The methodology was implemented in the Abaqus
finite element package utilising Python scripting for simulation definition
and Fortran code for user defined explicit material subroutines.
Micro scale unit cells were tested in longitudinal, transverse and shear
loading directions over a range of strain rates.  The results of the micro
scale testing were converted into material properties of the meso scale
yarns / tows.  Meso scale unit cells were tested in in-plane, through
thickness and shear loading directions over of a range of strain rates.  The
results of the meso scale testing were converted into material properties of
macro scale polymer composite materials.
The modelling methodology was validated against experimental testing
conducted on meso scale samples over a range of strain rates using an
electromechanical universal static test machine and an instrumented falling
weight drop tower.
The contribution to knowledge from this study is the development of a
validated modelling methodology for predicting the elastic, damage and
strain rate dependent response of polymer composite materials at a micro
and meso scale.
