A systematic approach to the extraction of data from disparate data sources is proposed. The
World Wide Web is a most diverse dataset; identifying ways in which this large database
provides means for data quality verification with concepts such as data lineage and provenance
allows to follow the same approach as a means to aid decision-making in sensitive domains
such as healthcare.
Through lessons learned from research in the UK and internationally, we conclude that
emphasis on interoperable and model-based support of the data syndication can enhance data
quality, an issue still current (American Hospital Association, 2015) and with data barriers in
healthcare due to governance concerns. To improve on the above, we start by proposing a
system for solution-orientated reporting of errors associated with the extraction of routinely
collected clinical data. We then explore key concepts to assess the readiness of data for
research and define an ontology-driven approach to create data dictionaries for quality
improvement in healthcare. Finally, we apply this research to facilitate the enablement of
consistent data recording across a health system to allow for service quality comparisons.
Work deriving from this research and built by the author commissioned and aided by the UK
NHS, University of Surrey, Green Cross Medical, particularly in creating and testing software
systems in real-world scenarios, has facilitated: quality improvement in healthcare data
extraction from GP practices in the UK, a state-of-art system for Web-enabling Hospital
Episode Statistics (HES) data for dermatology and, finally, an online system designed to
enable cancer Multi-Disciplinary Teams (MDTs) to self-assess and receive feedback on how
their team performs against the standards set out in The Characteristics of an Effective
MDT provided by NHS IQ, formerly part of National Cancer Action Team (NCAT), which in
2016 won the Quality in Care Programmes Digital Innovation in the Treatment of Cancer
award.
Further experimentation shows there is potential for the methods proposed to be applicable in
other sectors such as the investment sector (initial investigation has happened through the
early stages of this research) but it is suggested that this potential be explored further.
