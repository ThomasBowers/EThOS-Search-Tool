Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality
worldwide, of which cardiomyopathies account for a proportion. One of the
hallmarks of progressive heart disease is diminished energy metabolism
associated with cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction. Recent evidence directly
implicates malfunctioning mitochondria and altered mitochondrial dynamics in
the development of heart disease. Yet, little is known about mitochondrial
remodelling changes that might contribute to the development of heart failure.
A recently identified mouse mutant in the Dnm1l gene, Python, leads to
the development of dilated cardiomyopathy at specific ages. The work reported
herein focussed on understanding the mechanisms responsible for the
development of cardiomyopathy in this model. Evidence was obtained of
alteration in mitochondria, peroxisome and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
morphology in various cell types. There was a suggestion of altered physical
interaction between the mitochondria and the ER. Increased cytosolic calcium
levels and reduced mitochondrial uptake of calcium were also observed in
Python fibroblasts. Mitochondrial membranes were also depolarised. These
changes resulted in reduced oxidative phosphorylation activity in the hearts of
Python mice, which showed a progressive reduction with age. Ultimately a
decrease in ATP levels occurred, which was unsustainable with normal heart
function. DNM1L expression was found to increase with age in hearts of wild
type mice, but not other tissues. This may be suggestive of an increase in the
importance for the DNM1L protein in the ageing heart, though the exact
reasons for this remain elusive.
Fragmented mitochondria have been postulated to contribute to the
development of Huntingtons disease. However, a reduction in fragmentation
through introduction of the Python mutation did not alleviate the progressive
development of symptoms in these animals.
We hypothesize that the Python mutation impairs the ability of
mitochondrial-ER tethering. Subsequent dysfunctional mitochondrial calcium
uptake and altered mitochondrial membrane potential, leads to a progressive
decline in oxidative phosphorylation activity and ATP production.
