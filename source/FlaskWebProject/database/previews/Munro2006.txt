Searches for proton 
Proton radioactivity from the highly neutron-deficient nuclide ' 35Tb
has been identified using a new double-sided silicon strip detector (DSSD)
system at the Fragment Mass Analyser at Argonne National Laboratory.
The decay occurs with an energy of E = 1179(7)keV and a half-life t 1 ,, 2  =
94Otjts. ' 35Tb was produced via the bombardment of a 92Mo target with
a 315MeV 50Cr beam, and is the first isotope to be detected from a (p6n)
evaporation channel in heavy ion fusion-evaporation reactions. Proton decay
rate calculations suggest that this nuclide has a large prolate deformation,
in agreement with the predictions of the Mller-Nix mass model and the
experimental observations of the neighbouring odd-even lanthanide proton
emitters 131 Eu and 141 Ho.
An unsuccessful search for the predicted proton emitters 125,126  Pm,
using the (p6n) and (p5n) evaporation channels respectively, is also reported.
The non-observation of 126Pm is consistent with mass model Q predictions,
but the non-observation of proton emission from 125Pm suggests a Q value
which differs significantly from predictions, or places an upper limit on the
production cross-section of this nucleus.
The Q predictions of the Mller-Nix and Liran-Zeldes mass models are
compared with the currently available data set of experimentally-derived Q
values for proton-unbound nuclei in the region of observed proton radioac-
tivity. Both models are found to perform reasonably well and provide useful
predictions in this extremely neutron-deficient region.
