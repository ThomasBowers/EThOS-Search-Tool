The current era of technology, which is also known as the age of data has
changed the entire perception about technology. The amount of data
generated everyday by devices with limited resources is unprecedented and
the volume of worlds data doubles in every two years [1]. This means that the
level of security required to protect the data generation and management
entities is more than it ever was. The recent attacks by a ransomware known
as WannaCry, which shook the infrastructure of many big organizations
before it was stopped [2], [3] raises the question on the security mechanisms
that are used to protect the computing infrastructure and sensitive data.
The samples of recent lethal malware; WannaCry, Petya [4], [5] or Mirai [6]
caught in the wild, are not only capable of damaging giant organization or
causing financial damage to banks, they have the capability of bringing down
the entire infrastructure of World Wide Web that could possibly trigger a
catastrophic event [7] . The most disturbing aspect of this scenario is, that
these malware target the existing vulnerabilities in individual computers
without even triggering an alert in the security software installed [8]. Not only
the individual computers, computers part of an enterprise network, or smart
devices are attacked by such malware, the infected devices are frequently
used to attack bigger targets [9], such as; internet service providers,
government organizations and infrastructures, and email servers.
