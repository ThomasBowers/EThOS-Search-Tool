A Temporal Text Mining Framework for 
We are living in the "Information Age". The main characteristic is the amazing
growth of data that are being generated and stored making it difficult for humans
to understand. In most companies and organisations valuable time and effort is
wasted in ineffective searches through multiple information sources including
web sites and other conventional sources. This problem of information overload
is further exacerbated due to the unstructured format of the majority of the data.
The vast amount of data found in an organisation, some estimates run as high as
80%, are textual such as reports, emails, etc. [19] This type of unstructured data
usually lacks metadata (data about data) and as a consequence there is no
standard means to facilitate search, query and analysis. On the other hand Web is
the biggest document collection and most of the current Web's content is
designed for human beings to read and not for computer programs. To date, the
Web has developed a medium of documents for people rather than for data and
information that can be processed automatically. [2]
While the amount of textual data available to us is constantly increasing, our
ability to understand and process this information remains constant. A human
editor can only recognise that a new event has occurred by carefully following all
the web pages or other textual sources. This is clearly inadequate
for the volume
and complexity of the information involved. The need for automated extraction
of useful knowledge from huge amounts of textual data
in order to assist human
analysis is apparent. The rapid adoption of the e-commerce
