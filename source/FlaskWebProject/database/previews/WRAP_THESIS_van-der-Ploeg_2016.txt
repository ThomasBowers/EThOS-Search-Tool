Asclepius was worshipped in over 900 sanctuaries across the Graeco-Roman
world. Although the cult had been disseminated across eastern Mediterranean from
the 5th century onwards, it was only when the Romans took over the cult that it was
dispersed all over the empire to become an empire-wide cult. This thesis looks at the
impact of the Roman Empire on the cult, examining how Rome took over the
existing cult, the ways in which Rome influenced it, and the relationship between the
religion of Empire and local religion.
The key questions that this thesis aims to ask are: How did the Roman
Empire impact upon the cult of Asclepius? How were global and regional cult
identities articulated in response to each other as a result of this impact? How did
increased connectivity between areas play an important part in the creation and
stimulation of cultic identities? Did Asclepius spheres of influence grow or adapt as
a result of Roman benefactions? and What were provincial responses to Roman
worship and dissemination of the cult?
The timeframe for this thesis will be from 27 BC until Severus Alexanders
death in AD 235. Chapter One will introduce the scope of this thesis as well as the
general theories which underpin this research. A survey of the cult before the
Augustan period will be presented in Chapter Two. Further chapters will each
examine a different aspect of the Roman impact on the cult, with the third focussing
on imperial influences and the worship of the god by Roman and provincial elites;
the fourth on how the Roman army influenced the cult; the fifth how multiple forms
of the god were worshipped side-by-side in North Africa.
