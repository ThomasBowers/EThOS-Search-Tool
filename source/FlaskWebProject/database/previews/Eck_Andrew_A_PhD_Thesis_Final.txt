PhD Thesis: The Disappearance of Robin Melling
A small town in Maine is plagued with a rash of missing persons after a mysterious tremor, termed
the Earthquake, shakes the whole world. Years later, after being severely injured in a car accident
caused  by  the  Earthquake,  teenage  Nathan  Alexander  is  still  adjusting-  dealing  with  reduced
mobility,  overbearing  parents,  and a  crush on  Robin,  a  girl  who works  with  him in  an  occult
bookstore. Over coffee he senses a dark shadow- which pulls Robin into the dream world. Robin is
kidnapped and gradually loses herself to the monster. Nathan must find a way to save her with only
a dream swallow, a bookmark, and a small town cop to help him.
