The Large Hadron Collider is a particle accelerator designed to produce proton-
proton collisions at unprecedented energies. ATLAS is a general purpose de-
tector designed to measure the products of such collisions, thereby allowing
scientists to explore a new and extremely rich physics programme. In such an
environment, certain components of the Standard Model of particle physics
will be produced in abundance. Among them are the propagators of the weak
nuclear force, namely the W and Z vector bosons1. Such particles will be pro-
duced in association with hadronic activity, which we can measure in ATLAS
as jets of particles. It is therefore imperative for searches for new physics
processes, and continued study of the Standard Model, to gain a comprehensive
understanding of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). A deeper understanding
of QCD will facilitate precise predictions of hadronic behaviour at the high
energy frontier of experimental particle physics.
In addition, W and Z bosons with associated hadronic activity produce the
same final state signatures as processes that could indicate the presence of new
physics. A thorough understanding of how W+jets and Z+jets events behave
is crucial to new physics studies, and studies of the Higgs boson, for which
W+jets and Z+jets events are background processes.
1Throughout this work, W refers to either a W+ or W boson, and Z refers to either a
Z0 or  boson.
