A Study Of Longitudinal Hadronic Shower
In the high energy environment of the Large Hadron Collider, there is a finite probability
for the longitudinal tail of the hadronic shower represented by a jet to leak out of the
calorimeter, commonly referred to as longitudinal hadronic shower leakage, or jet punch-
through. This thesis prescribes a method for identifying such punch-through jets via
the use of muon activity found behind a jet in the ATLAS muon spectrometer, finding an
occurance rate of up to 18% in the worst aected regions. Punch-through jets were found
to degrade the measured jet energy scale by up to 30%, and jet energy resolution by a factor
of 3. A correction to remove these eects was developed in Monte Carlo and validated in
data, with associated systematic uncertainties derived. The correction was found to negate
the degredation of the measured jet energy scale, improving the jet energy resolution by up
to 10% in the worst aected regions, and up to 1.6% overall. The correction was integrated
into the final 2012 ATLAS jet energy calibration scheme as the fifth step of the Global
Sequential corrections. The prescription developed in this thesis to derive the correction is
currently being used by ATLAS in Run II of the Large Hadron Collider.
