Commanding Texts: Knowledge-ordering, Identity Construction 
This thesis is about military manualssynoptic pedagogic texts on military matters  produced
in the first few centuries of the Roman imperial period. These are not the most popular of
Classical texts, often described as dry, practical, and straightforward, but this thesis argues that
they merit far more attention and appreciation than they have received in the scholarship so
far, and will explore some of the areas in which this more sustained scrutiny is particularly
fruitful.  Before doing so, however, it is worth providing a short summary of the present state of
the field, since the study of ancient military manuals has been associated mainly with the
discipline of military history and has altered as that discipline itself has changed over the last
decades, and since Classics itself also extended its textual horizons over the same time frame.
This thesis builds on this recent work, as well as developing themes and questions about empire
and identity, power and knowledge in the Roman world that have emerged from other areas of
ancient historical enquiry.
