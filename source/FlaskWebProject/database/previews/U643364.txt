This thesis examines the ideology and practice of the Communist Party of
Great Britain (CPGB) in the 1950s. Ever since its formation, the CPGB had adhered
to, and modelled itself upon, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
The Soviet Party transformed from its revolutionary ideology and practice
towards representing state dictatorship under Stalin. This transformation from
Bolshevism to Stalinism had profound implications for the British Party. Following
Stalins death in 1953, British Communism embarked upon a process of d
stalinisation; a process accelerated by the speech of First Secretary Khruschev to the
20^ Congress of the Soviet Party in February 1956.
This period coincided with a general decline in British Party membership and
with an increased emphasis on electoral practice. Two contradictions emerged as the
CPGB attempted to reconcile the socialist and revolutionary aspirations of its
membership with the practices of Stalinism and this concentration on elections. These
socialist aspirations were undermined by Khruschevs revelations about Stalins
crimes and his own regimes intervention in Flungary at the end of 1956. Members
response to 1956 threatened to damage the Party beyond repair. A disparate
opposition emerged in 1956, but never coordinated into a coherent challenge to the
leadership. The continuing loyalty of the majority of members, combined with an
increase in industrial, unrest during this period, to reverse the sudden decline in
membership precipitated by 1956.
In 1957, the Party rescued itself, partly through intervention within the trade
union rank and file. In parallel with this rank and file level activity, the Party had, since
its formation, operated a strategy which sought to place members into the leadership
of the trade unions. The thesis demonstrates the limitations and the damaging
implications of this leadership strategy as it examines Communist intervention into the
Electrical Trades Union.
