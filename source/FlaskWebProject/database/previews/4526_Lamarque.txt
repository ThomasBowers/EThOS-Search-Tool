In Rwanda, the high visibility of uniformed state officials at strategic sites creates a
misleading impression of how public order is maintained. In fact, crime prevention in
the countrys major cities relies to a significant degree on non-state, often ostensibly
voluntary, participation and takes place in the margins of centralized state authority.
The Rwanda National Police (RNP) has prioritized crime prevention over
investigation, and by partitioning the country into small self-policing neighbourhood
communities, has created an environment resistant to micro-level violence. The
degree to which the Rwandan government has been able to coordinate the
participation of civilian community members in the maintenance of public order is a
powerful manifestation of its state reach.
The extent of Rwandan state reach is most striking in Gisenyi, the countrys largest
border town, where the government has mobilised local communities to share
information and effectively control levels of street crime despite what appear to be
significant difficulties resulting from the towns geographical position. Crime
prevention in Gisenyi takes place in the context of widespread criminality
immediately across the border in Goma, the capital of the DRCs North Kivu Province.
The asymmetry in the prevalence of crime is sustained despite the border itself being
relatively frictionless, allowing both goods and people to cross with ease. I argue that
these issues are not unrelated, and that the dialectical relationship between Goma
and Gisenyi bolsters mechanisms that contribute to the prevention of street crime
on the Rwandan side of the border.
