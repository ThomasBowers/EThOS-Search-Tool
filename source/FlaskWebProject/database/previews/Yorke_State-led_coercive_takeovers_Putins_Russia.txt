Since Vladimir Putin first became Russias President in 2000, the state has played an
increasingly active and interventionist role in the economy, including through its involvement
in a large number of coercive takeovers of privately-owned businesses. The best known case
is the Yukos affair, but there have been many other, less prominent takeovers. These have
largely been explained as predatory acts by state officials seeking to enrich themselves or
increase their power. This has contributed to the perception that Putins Russia is a
kleptocracy, with the state given free rein to engage in economically-destructive attacks on
property rights.
This thesis studies a number of state-led coercive takeovers in Putins Russia, including the
Yukos affair, and argues that they cannot be explained as predatory acts initiated by rent-
seeking state officials. Instead, they were the work of state officials attempting to pursue
economic development while countering perceived threats to state sovereignty.
The Yukos affair resulted in the companys de facto nationalisation and heralded a broader
trend of expanding state ownership in the economy. But two other coercive takeovers studied
here instead resulted in the companies being transferred to new private owners. In other cases
where nationalisation was the clear goal, the state-owned companies who emerged as buyers
chose indirect forms of ownership over their new assets. The varying ownership outcomes are
found to have been determined by institutional factors which constrained the behaviour of the
state, contributing to its preference for takeovers that were negotiated rather than entirely
coercive, and turning each case into a bargaining game between state and targeted business
owner. Thus Russia is some way from kleptocracy, not only because of the developmental
aspirations of its political leadership, but also thanks to partial progress towards institutional
checks on arbitrary state coercion.
