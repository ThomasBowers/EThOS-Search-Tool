Setting out from the premise that legislation is performative, this study
initially explores the relationship between state cultural policy, censorship, and
theatre production. The case is made that following the so-called conservative-
authoritarian turn in Russia in 2012, there has been a gradual return to an
interventionist cultural policy qualitatively similar in some respects to that of Soviet-
era Socialist Realism. I identify and describe the period in question  which is
characterised by intensified censorship in its numerous guises, a new highly
prescriptive cultural policy, and arbitrary repressions of nonconformist elements in
society  as the period of High Putinism.
Having established the environment in which contemporary theatre in Russia
operated during the second decade of the twenty-first century, surveys of the field are
combined with close analysis of a dozen productions from the period. Collectively,
these works all demonstrate in various ways what Jacques Rancire calls dissensus,
which is to say they resist, circumvent, and transgress the norms of the ideological
consensus set out by the state cultural policy. What they develop instead are
alternative ways of thinking, seeing and doing that look beyond the horizons of the
status quo. They achieve this through a variety of means, including aesthetic
experimentation, audience participation, digital technology, contemporary dance and
music, as well as radical postdramatic staging devices  in short, a hybridisation of
genres, styles, disciplines, and media. The resulting thesis is a cross-section of a vivid
contemporary theatre scene existing largely on the margins of cultural life. From this
position of marginality, a diverse set of emancipatory performance practices emerges.
