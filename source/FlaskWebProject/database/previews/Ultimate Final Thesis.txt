DEMENTIA AT THE THRESHOLD:  
This thesis argues for a profound shift in the way in which we understand dementia,
advocating from a move away from the rhetoric of loss and decay, and towards an
acknowledgement of people with dementia as whole and undiminished by the progress of
their disease. It highlights the role of the narratives of decay in oppressing and disabling
people with dementia, and contends that it the meaning attributed to dementia, rather than
the dementia itself, which limits both what people with dementia can do and who they can
This research uses an ethnographic approach to explores key areas where the physical, social
and temporal spaces controlled by people with dementia meet those controlled by others,
and elucidates the complex relationality of these threshold spaces. Through drawing on 78
hours of audio interviews with 11 people living with dementia in Scotland, this research
highlights key physical, social, and temporal thresholds that participants encountered as part
of their day-to-day lives.
This thesis highlights the weaknesses in approaches that construct people with dementia as
passive victims of biological tragedy. It offers instead a theoretical perspective that is rooted,
in the understanding that a person cannot be unmade by cognitive impairment. This
perspective is grounded in Heideggerian philosophy, and allows for a deeper exploration of
how people with dementia experience the physical, social, and temporal world as
undiminished Dasein living with cognitive impairment. These experiences are contextualised
through the lens provided by Thomas social relational approach to disability, which
emphasises the role of society in disabling and oppressing people with dementia. These
findings emphasise the need for a profound shift in both how dementia is represented as a
reductive and tragic process and the ways in which barriers to social inclusion are constructed
as the result of medical rather than social processes.
