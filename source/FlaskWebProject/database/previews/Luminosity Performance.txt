In the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), particle physics events are created by col-
liding high energy proton beams at a number of interaction points around the
ring. One of the main performance indicating parameters of the LHC is the lu-
minosity. The luminosity is limited by, amongst other things, the strength of the
beam-beam interaction. In this thesis, the effect of the beam-beam interaction
on the luminosity performance of the LHC and the proposed High Luminosity
Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) is investigated. Results from a number of ded-
icated, long-range beam-beam machine studies are presented and analysed. In
these studies, the minimum beam-beam separation for two different  optics
are identified. This separation defines the minimum operational crossing angle
in the LHC. The data from these studies are then compared to simulation of the
dynamic aperture and the results are discussed. In addition to studies of the
LHC, an analytical approach is derived in order to describe the hourglass effect,
which may become a contributing factor in limiting the luminosity performance
of the HL-LHC.
