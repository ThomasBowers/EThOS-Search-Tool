Debonding and stretching of biogenic
Plant material can regulate the mechanical properties of its cellular structure by
changing: (i) the structure of the cell wall, (ii) the cell core pressure, and (iii)
the cell-cell cohesion. The relevant scale at which such phenomena occur, though
beyond the capacity of the human eye, can be followed by mechanical analysis
and mathematical models based on micro-structural evidence. This thesis focuses
on two fundamental mechanical aspects. First, it concerns the mechanism of cell
debonding, as this is key in explaining the softening of fruit and legumes dur-
ing storage or cooking, and is decisive for the perceived quality of food products.
Particular attention is given to the mathematical modelling of damage through
shear deformation as this has been largely neglected in the literature due to many
theoretical and computational difficulties. Second, it provides a multiscale hyper-
elastic framework which relates the stresses and strains of a whole structure to
those at the cell level, and vice versa. Specifically, the non-linear elastic moduli
at the macroscopic level are derived systematically from those at the cell level.
