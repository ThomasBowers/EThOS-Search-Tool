Political Protest and Dissent in the Khrushchev Era
This thesis addresses the subject of political dissent during the Khrushchev era.  It
examines the kinds of protest behaviours that individuals and groups engaged in and
the way that the Soviet authorities responded to them.  The findings show that
dissenting activity was more frequent and more diverse during the Khrushchev period
than has previously been supposed and that there were a number of significant
continuities in the forms of dissent, and the authorities responses to these acts, across
the eras of Stalin, Khrushchev and Brezhnev.  In the early Khrushchev years a large
proportion of the political protest and criticism that took place remained essentially
loyal to the regime and Marxist-Leninist in outlook, though this declined in later years
as communist utopianism and respect for the ruling authorities seem to have
significantly diminished.  In place of mass terror, the authorities increasingly moved
toward more rationalised and targeted practices of social control, seeking to manage
dissent rather than to eradicate it either by persuasion or by force.  All of this was
reflective of the fact that the relationship between state and society was undergoing a
vital transitional stage during the Khrushchev years, as both parties began to establish
for themselves what had and had not changed since Stalins death.
