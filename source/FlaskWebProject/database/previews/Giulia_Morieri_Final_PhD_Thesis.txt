The legume-Rhizobium symbiosis results in the formation of nitrogen-fixing nodules.
Bacterial infection occurs through the formation of a tunnel-like structure called an
infection thread. The rhizobially-made Nod factor is essential for the establishment of this
symbiosis. When Nod factor is added to legume root hair cells two calcium responses are
observed: a rapid influx of calcium in the root hair tip and periodic calcium oscillations in
and around the nuclear area. The role of these calcium responses in the infection of
legume by rhizobial has been studied in this thesis. The function of the calcium flux was
investigated in Medicago truncatula. Structurally-modified Nod factors produced by
rhizobial mutants that are unable to infect roots successfully via infection threads, were
impaired for induction of calcium flux. M. truncatula and L. japonicus infection mutants
were also tested for the calcium flux response. Together the results point towards a key
role for the Nod factorinduced calcium flux during infection thread initiation. In order to
study whether root hair calcium spiking is essential for cortical nodule organogenesis,
Nod factor-induced calcium spiking was tested in the Lotus japonicus symrk14 har1-1
mutant. Inoculation of this mutant results in the formation of nodules that are not
infected by mean of infection threads. The lack of infection thread and the huge
reduction of calcium spiking in the symrk14-har1-1 mutant shows a link between calcium
spiking and bacterial infection. Finally, the role of the Lectinnucleotide
phosphohydrolase (LNP) in the Nod factor signalling pathway was investigated. The LNP
antisense line blocked for nodule formation was found to be defective for Nod factor-
induced calcium spiking, calcium flux and NIN gene expression, thus revealing a novel
component of the Nod factor signalling pathway.
