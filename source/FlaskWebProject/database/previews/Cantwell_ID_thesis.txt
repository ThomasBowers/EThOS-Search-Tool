Despite it being recognised as a problem worthy of consideration over a century
ago, we have little mechanistic understanding of how the size of a cells nucleus is
determined. The simply shaped fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is
genetically tractable and undergoes a closed mitosis, making it a useful system in
which to probe mechanisms of nuclear size control. In S. pombe cells, nuclear
volume scales with cell volume, and not DNA content, across a wide range of cell
volumes and throughout the cell cycle, maintaining a constant nuclear volume to
cell volume (N/C) ratio. This thesis explores the mechanisms by which this scaling
is achieved, using physiological, genetic and biochemical approaches.
N/C ratio is perturbed and resultant nuclear and cellular growth rates of individual
cells are assessed. N/C ratio homeostasis is observed. Both high and low aberrant
N/C ratios correct rapidly in individual cells. Analysis of the kinetics of N/C ratio
recovery is carried out and mathematical models of nuclear size control are
proposed. To identify molecular components and biological processes with roles in
nuclear size control mechanisms, a genetic screen for deletion mutants with
aberrant nuclear size and biochemical analysis of a nuclear size mutant are carried
out. Ribosome biogenesis, RNA processing and nucleocytoplasmic transport are all
implicated in nuclear size control.
