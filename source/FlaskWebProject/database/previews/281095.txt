STUDIES OF GROUND DEFORMATION IN 
This thesis considers the problems associated with the analysis
and prediction of rock slope behaviour in the environment of British
surface coal mining. Its studies form part of a wider research
program considering the stability of Coal Measures slopes and mine
design.
It considers the requirements for quantitative data in order
to define slope environments. The results of a survey of a number
of cases of slope instability are reported, together with the
detailed history of instability encountered during the complete
working life of one large mine. The conclusions gained from an
analysis of this historical data contribute to the assessment
of instability mechanisms and contributory factors and thence
the design and application of analytical techniques.
The need for integrated field monitoring and mapping, supported
by laboratory testing, is stressed as the means of developing
effective slope analysis methods. The results of monitoring projects
at three mines in a range of slope settings are finally reported.
These projects aim to characterize the extent of deformation
arising during and after slope excavation and to assess the
influence of various mining, geological and environmental factors.
