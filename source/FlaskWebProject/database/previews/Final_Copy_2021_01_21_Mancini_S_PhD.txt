The demand for reliable and replicable short-term probabilistic earthquake forecasts
is becoming increasingly compelling, as we continue to witness seismic sequences
with occasionally multiple disturbing or damaging earthquakes.
Purely statistical models of earthquake clustering adequately capture the patterns
of triggered seismicity and currently represent the standard approach for different
operational earthquake forecasting systems.
On the other hand, developing and testing physics-based forecast models let us vali-
date the most popular physical hypotheses for earthquake triggering and clustering.
These models couple complex stress interactions between faults with laboratory-
derived frictional laws providing a framework for earthquake forecasting in the con-
text of continuum mechanics. However, while featuring the unique characteristic
of integrating many products of observational seismology, they are extremely data-
intensive especially in near real-time settings where their applicability is still con-
tentious.
Over the last decade, the scientific advancements in seismology have provided higher
resolution seismic catalogues as well as improved fault characterisations; this presents
us with great opportunities to (1) evaluate their usefulness in improving the short-
term performance of models of both forecast categories, (2) explore which specific
modelling choices driven by real-time data quality and availability boost our fore-
casting skills and by how much, and (3) assess what are the data products required
for such model improvements to be operationally delivered.
To answer the above points, this thesis presents three forecasting experiments offer-
ing a novel experimental strategy, where the absolute and relative performance of
statistical and physics-based models is formally quantified under different forecast-
ing modes and modelling choices, in both cases of tectonic and induced seismicity.
Looking ahead to the future improvements in near real-time input data quality
promised by the most recent progresses in artificial intelligence techniques, the re-
sults of these experiments suggest what are the pathways that should be undertaken
for future model developments.
