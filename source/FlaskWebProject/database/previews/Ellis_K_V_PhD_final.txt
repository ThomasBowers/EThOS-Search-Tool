Topological Reconstruction Algorithm for Parton Scatters
There is strong motivation to study standard model physics using the highest-
energy data provided by the Large Hadron Collider. This is aided by the
process of defining clusters of hadrons to form jets. Existing jet-finders
are dependent on pre-defined parameters which, to some extent, influence
their properties. This thesis introduces a novel algorithm which aims to
reconstruct partons outgoing from hard interactions, prior to any splitting,
by concentrating solely on the highest momentum transfer scale. In this
way parton properties such as fragmentation and structure functions from
hadron colliders may be compared directly with results from DIS and e+e
annihilation.
This original, standalone tool is named traps - the Topological Re-
construction Algorithm for Parton Scatters. The algorithm was developed
using Pythia Monte Carlo QCD events, under a pragmatic approach that
assumes the model provides a good approximation to reality at both hadronic
and partonic level.
Various tests were made to gauge the performance of the algorithm against
standard jet-finders. The infrared safety and algorithm speed were also as-
sessed. The objective of traps is to have low sensitivity to parameters, and
to be fast and robust. A high event acceptance is necessary, as maximum
statistics are required where cross-sections are at their lowest.
A chapter of this thesis is dedicated to a description of the authors studies
in calibration and monitoring of the timing of the ATLAS Level-1 Calorimeter
Trigger system. Pulses from triggered energy are sent via largely  =
0.1  0.1 granularity trigger towers. Synchronous triggering with 1-2 ns
precision is required for the system to make an accurate energy estimate.
