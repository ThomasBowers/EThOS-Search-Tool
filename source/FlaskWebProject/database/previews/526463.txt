Snakebite by venomous snakes is a serious health problem in many Countries of the world. The
identification of the offending snake through venom analysis would allow for specific treatment to
be given minimising mortality and morbidity rates.
This work focused on developing an immunoassay for the species-specific identification of
Bothrops and Lachesis venoms. Crossreactivity studies showed that the venoms shared many
crossreacting epitopes. The use of venom adsorbents yielded antivenoms capable of discriminating
the homologous venom from heterologous venoms in 'in vitro' tests both in buffer solutions and
when added to normal human serum In the conditions studied, species-specific venom
identification was independent of venom concentration and antivenom dilution. Western blot
analysis, revealed in a venom ')lool" from a single species, components that could be species-
specific markers. These were shown to be present also in venoms from individual snakes of the
same species from different geographic regions. Immunoaffinity chromatography of the
B. jararaca venom suggests a partial purification of its species-specific component.
The work showed the possibility of species-specific identification of Bothropic and Lachetic
venoms. This identification is obtained through the demonstration of specific venom components.
The application of this methodology to the clinical identification of snakebites could assist in the
improvement of treatment of these casualties.
