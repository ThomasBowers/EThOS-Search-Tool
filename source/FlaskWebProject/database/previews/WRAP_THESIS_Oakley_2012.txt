This thesis consists of three papers: a literature review, an empirical paper and a
reflective paper. The literature review considers the validity of measures of pre-
morbid intellectual functioning with people with varying levels of dementia severity.
It aims to be of use to British clinicians by focussing specially on tests that were
designed for use with a British English speaking population. No single measure of
pre-morbid intellectual functioning is found to be valid for use with people of all
levels of dementia severity. The use of multiple measures for estimating pre-morbid
intellectual functioning are indicated.
The empirical paper investigates the relationship between a persons pre-morbid level
of intellectual functioning and the amount of cognitive decline that they experience
prior to gaining a diagnosis of dementia. It uses a retrospective correlational design to
analyse data from existing memory clinic files. A significant positive Pearsons
correlation coefficient is found between pre-morbid intellectual functioning and
amount of cognitive decline at the point of diagnosis, in all three of the diagnostic
groups. This suggests that people with high pre-morbid functioning have to undergo
greater cognitive decline before they are given a diagnosis of dementia. Changes to
current clinical practice are indicated which take account of relative amounts of
cognitive decline in the diagnostic process.
Finally, a reflective account is presented which is based on the authors thoughts and
experiences of carrying out research in the field of dementia. This focuses on the
challenges in accessing retrospective clinical data. Suggestions are made regarding
future research and clinical practice.
