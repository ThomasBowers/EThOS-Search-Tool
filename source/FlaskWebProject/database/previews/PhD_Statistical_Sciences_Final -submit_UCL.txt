This thesis focuses on extending the ETAS model. ETAS is a special case of the Hawkes
process - a self-exciting point process that provides the opportunity for a multilayered
intensity structure that addresses the rate of events as a function of previous events his-
tory. Triggering and clustering behaviours are naturally captured. The most simplistic
version of the Hawkes process takes into account a single temporal sequence. Additional
features such as marks, spatial information, other labels and multivariate scenarios can
be considered. In this thesis we contribute primarily to three main aspects of a Hawkes
process - temporal, spatial and multivariate analyses. Each of these challenges were ad-
dressed by incorporating new functionalities into the base process. Then we also solved
the emerging estimation needs.
We began by exploring a renewal immigration concept where the main (immigrant)
events follow a non-Poissonian distribution that provides an inhomogeneous temporal
ground modelling. Then we explored a non-parametric spatial kernel estimation for
the inference of the main events spatial aggregation. This Bayesian density estimation
relies on a Dirichlet process application in a multivariate Normal distribution mixture
modelling. Finally, we explored the application of self-exciting process in the context
of spatially explicit capturing data. We introduced discrete space, continuous time,
multivariate Hawkes process that is tailored towards limited number of observations
from multiple objects that share common behaviour.
The introduced models and methods suggest superior performance compared to con-
ventional techniques. They are directly applicable to fields where spatio-temporal clus-
tering is observed. Some of the examples include crime, financial indicators change,
earthquake modelling, people and animal movement.
