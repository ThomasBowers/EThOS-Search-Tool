James Rowson thesis Corrections 2018
This thesis will contextualise and critically explore how New Drama (Novaya Drama)
has been shaped by and adapted to the political, social, and cultural landscape under
Putinism (from 2000). It draws on close analysis of a variety of plays written by a
burgeoning collection of playwrights from across Russia, examining how this
provocative and political artistic movement has emerged as one of the most vehement
critics of the Putin regime. This study argues that the manifold New Drama repertoire
addresses key facets of Putinism by performing suppressed and marginalised voices in
public arenas. It contends that New Drama has challenged the established, normative
discourses of Putinism presented in the Russian media and by Putin himself, and
demonstrates how these productions have situated themselves in the context of the
nascent opposition movement in Russia. By doing so, this thesis will offer a fresh
perspective on how New Dramas precarious engagement with Putinism provokes
political debate in contemporary Russia, and challenges audience members to
consider their own role in Putins autocracy.
The first chapter surveys the theatrical and political landscape in Russia at the
turn of the millennium, focusing on the political and historical contexts of New
Drama in Russian theatre and culture. The final four chapters focus on specific case
studies. Chapter Two explores the development of political satire by contrasting
Varvara Faers BerlusPutin (2012) and Viktor Teterins Putin.doc (2005). Chapter
Three looks at Mikhail and Vyacheslav Durnenkovs The Drunks (Pianii, 2009) and
Pavel Pryzhkos The Soldier (Soldat, 2011). Chapter Four discusses two plays by
Vasilly Sigarev: Plasticine (Plastilin, 2000) and Black Milk (Chernoe Moloko, 2001).
Chapter Five explores the documentary plays The Bolotnaya Square Case (Bolotnoe
Delo, 2015) by Polina Borodina and Elena Greminas One Hour Eighteen Minutes
(Chas Vosemnadtsat, 2010, expanded in 2012).
