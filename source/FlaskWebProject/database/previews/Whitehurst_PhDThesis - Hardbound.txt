Palladium-mediated CH Functionalization 
Abstract: Palladium-mediated CH Functionalization of Aliphatic
Amines via High Valent Palladium(IV) Intermediates
William George Whitehurst
The search for new and distinct disconnection strategies is one of the foremost challenges in
synthetic organic chemistry. To this end, transition metal-catalyzed CH functionalization
represents a current area of research which aims to develop transformations that directly convert
CH bonds to CC or Cheteroatom bonds, often enabling the synthesis of functionalized
products that are not readily accessible using classical synthetic methods.
The work disclosed in this thesis concerns the Pd-mediated CH functionalization of
unprotected aliphatic amines, in which the amine nitrogen coordinates to the Pd centre to
promote cyclometalation to the key palladacycle intermediate. Specifically, research focused
on the design and optimization of novel oxidants that would provide mild and general
conditions to oxidize amine-derived palladacycles to high valent PdIV intermediates capable of
undergoing a variety of reductive elimination pathways to afford a diverse range of
functionalized products.
