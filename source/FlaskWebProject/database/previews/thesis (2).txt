Monte Carlo Simulations of Heavy Particles for the
As the Large Hadron Collider has switched on at CERN in Geneva, accurate predic-
tions for complex hadronic processes are essential for the validation of theory and
therefore the success of the machine. After motivating the requirement for a Monte
Carlo event generator, the principles and Physics behind such a generator are laid
Following this, the Monte Carlo tuning system Professor is used to give an assess-
ment of the uncertainty from tuning Herwig++ and the results from this analysis
used, along with a more accurate implementation of Higgs boson decays using the
POWHEG method, to determine the error associated with searching for the Higgs
boson with a jet substructure technique.
Then, modifications to the shower to take into account the top quark width are
presented along with radiation patterns from top quark production processes for up
to two external gluons. A general algorithm is outlined for systematically including
these corrections.
Finally, as the LHC is ultimately a discovery machine, it is pertinent to provide
Monte Carlo studies of new Physics. The colour sextet diquark model is looked at
in the final chapter of this thesis, and the associated phenomenology studied.
