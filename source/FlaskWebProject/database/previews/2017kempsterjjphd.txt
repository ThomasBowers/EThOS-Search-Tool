Measurements of charge and CP asymmetries in b-hadron
Same- and opposite-sign charge asymmetries are measured in lepton+jets tt events in which a
b-hadron decays semileptonically to a soft muon, using data corresponding to an integrated lu-
minosity of 20.3 fb1 from proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of
s = 8 TeV
collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The charge asymme-
tries are based on the charge of the lepton from the top-quark decay and the charge of the soft
muon from the semileptonic decay of a b-hadron and are measured in a fiducial region corre-
sponding to the experimental acceptance. Four CP asymmetries (one mixing and three direct)
are measured and are found to be compatible with zero and consistent with the Standard Model.
