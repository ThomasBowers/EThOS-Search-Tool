Development of Selective Ligands for the 
In order to increase the public approval of nuclear power as an alternative to fossil fuels,
developments in waste management of high-level liquid waste must be made. Fission
products, such as 137Cs and 90Sr, are highly radiotoxic and principal heat generators in high-
level liquid waste. Removal of these fission products would reduce the radiotoxicity, the long-
term heat generation and the volume of high-level liquid waste enabling the simplification of
storage design for nuclear waste. 127Cs and 90Sr are also environmental contaminants caused
by past nuclear disasters. Removal of these contaminants from the environment would reduce
the risk of health complications in both animals and humans. This thesis outlines the synthesis
and extraction capabilities of caesium and strontium selective ligands on solid-supported
extractants including magnetic nanoparticles and macroscopic silica gel for the selective
separation of caesium and strontium from other group I and II elements. Recovery of
fission/corrosion products using N-donor extractants is also reported.
