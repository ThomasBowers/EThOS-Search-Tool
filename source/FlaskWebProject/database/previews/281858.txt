A revision of the genus Entada was made using data from gross morphology, seed
and seedling morphology, palynology, anatomy and phytochemistry.
A study of seed morphology allowed delimitation of closely-related species in this
genus while seedling morphology enabled recognition of species even by first leaf
morphology. Entada exhibits two germination patterns; climbers show epigynous
germination, while trees and shrubs have hypogynous germination. Entada has
tricolporate pollen grains with uniform morphology within sections. Pollen morphology
exhibited by Entada shows links to the Caesalpinioideae.
Among the vegetative characters studied were: habit, form, size and surface of the
leaf, rachis and stem. Vegetative morphology. was found to be useful in delimiting
species in the genus. Reproductive characters separated species very well even those
that could not be separated vegetatively.
A literature survey and fieldwork reveal that all the species in the genus are
known to have economic importance of one kind or another: they have medicinal value,
have a number of ethnobotanical uses as well as being used as food substitutes in some
cases.
The genus has been recognised to consist of 30 species (out of which 21 occur in
Africa, 6 in Asia and 2 in America while one of them occurs in all three continents) and
3 subspecies. These are classified into 8 sections of which section Suffruticosa is newly
described. The genus has been split into two subgenera.
