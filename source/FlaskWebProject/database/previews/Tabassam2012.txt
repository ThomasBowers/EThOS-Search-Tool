Physics Studies at a Future Linear
With the start of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, we will obtain a
new understanding of the physics beyond our current limits. New discoveries will
be made; but we will require a deeper understanding, which the LHC machine,
being a hadron collider, will not be able to elucidate. Instead, we will need an
e+e collider to make precision measurements of the newly discovered phenomena.
Electroweak symmetry breaking and the origin of fermion and boson masses are
fundamental issues in our understanding of particle physics. The essential piece
of electroweak symmetry breaking - the Higgs boson - will probably be discovered
at the LHC. If there are one, or more, Higgs boson(s) precise measurements of
all properties of the Higgs will be very important.
In this thesis I present two measurements of Standard Model Higgs boson
properties in the context of the International Linear Collider (ILC) at
s = 500
GeV, using the proposed International Linear Detector (ILD). First a performance
study of ILD to measure the branching ratios of the Higgs boson with mH = 120
GeV, where the Higgs boson is produced with a Z-boson via the Higgsstralung
process, and the Z decays into e+e or +. It will also be essential to study
the Higgs Yukawa coupling. Therefore, in the second part of this thesis, I present
a study of e+e  ttH with the aim of making a direct measurement of the
the top-Higgs coupling, using the semi-leptonic final state and mH of 120 GeV.
I show that the top-Higgs coupling can be measured with an accuracy of better
than 28%.
