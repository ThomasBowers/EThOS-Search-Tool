Coversheet for Thesis in Sussex Research Online
The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider has collected an unprecedented
amount of data in the 3 years of data taking since its start. In this document I will dis-
cuss the results of the analysis I performed during my PhD at the university of Sussex
for the search of Supersymmetry in events with three leptons (electron/muon/tau) and
missing transverse energy in the final state. The search is performed on the full dataset
collected by the experiment in 2012, at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. These results are
interpreted in SUSY models with chargino-neutralino pair production via decays involving
sleptons, staus, gauge bosons and the newly discovered Higgs boson. These results presen-
ted improve on previous searches performed at ATLAS in three lepton final states with
only electrons and muons. Special focus will be given to the optimisation process of Su-
persymmetry signal with respect to the SM background, and the statistical interpretation
of the results obtained with this search.
