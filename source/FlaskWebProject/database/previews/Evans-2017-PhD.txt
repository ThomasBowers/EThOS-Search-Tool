This dissertation documents a study of very rare B-meson decays at the LHCb
experiment, using data taken during the first experiment run of the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) and during the second experiment run until September 2016.
The LHCb experiment was designed to test the Standard Model of particle physics
and to search for New Physics effects that go beyond the scope of the Standard Model
through the decay of b hadrons produced in high energy proton-proton collisions
at the LHC. The measurements described in this dissertation are made using data
samples of proton-proton collisions with integrated luminosities of 1.0, 2.0 and
1.4 fb1, collected at centre-of-mass energies of 7, 8 and 13 TeV, respectively.
The branching fractions of the very rare B0  + and B0s  + decays and
the effective lifetime of B0s  + decays are precisely predicted by the Standard
Model and are sensitive to effects from New Physics. New Physics processes could
influence the B0s  + branching fraction and effective lifetime independently,
and therefore the two observables are complementary.
The B0s  + decay is observed with a statistical significance of 7.8 and
the branching fraction is measured to be B(B0s  +) = (3.0  0.6
0.2)  109.
The B0s  + effective lifetime is measured for the first time as 2.04  0.44
0.05 ps. The B0  + branching fraction is measured as B(B0  +) =
(1.5+1.21.0+0.20.1)  1010 with a statistical significance of 1.6. An upper limit is set for
the branching fraction of B(B0  +) < 3.4  1010 at the 95% confidence level.
All results are consistent with the predictions of the Standard Model.
