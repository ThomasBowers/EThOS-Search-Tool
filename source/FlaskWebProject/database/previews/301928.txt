Winter lentil (Lens culinaris) (i.e. sown in autumn) was investigated as a
potential crop for the UK, given previous experience that spring-sown lentil
matures too late and so yields are small and unreliable and seed quality is
poor. Experiments were conducted between October 1996 and August
1999.
Increased plant population density improved winter-survival by 10% (from 88
to 97%) as target population increased from 50 to 200 plants m-2 Yield-
density relations were parabolic, with an optimum spring plant population
density for seed yield between 80 and 120 plants m-2 for both small- and
large-seeded genotypes. An evaluation experiment including 1 2 genotypes
identified six with potential for UK agriculture: they gave seed yields of 147 - .
322 g d.m. m-2 combined with good seed quality. Six of these genotypes were
then grown at three sites (Berkshire, Cambridgeshire and Gloucestershire),
selected to provide a range of soil types and climates, and in two seasons to
assess relative performance and yield stability. Genotypes differed in relative
yield stability, and observations at three other sites in Hampshire, Norfolk and
Suffolk indicated that waterlogging was the most important factor limiting
adaptation. Investigations into harvesting methods discovered that chemical
desiccation followed by combine-harvesting provided for excellent seed
quality with negligible seed losses. In a three-year crop rotation experiment,
the cultivation of winter lentil increased grain yield of a subsequent wheat
crop by 4 - 24%, grain protein content by 9% and also grain quality
compared to an all cereal rotation.
This programme of research has demonstrated the potential for UK winter-
sown lentil, with yields in the region of 2.5 t ha-1, and a gross margin greater
than winter wheat. It has identified a suitable genotype (W A 8649090 from
the USA) and agronomy package for the crop under UK conditions, and has
attracted industry attention and collaboration.
