Multijet Background Estimation for
This thesis describes a data-driven technique for estimating the multijet
background to Supersymmetry (SUSY) searches with no leptons using the
ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The technique is used to
estimate multijet distributions in SUSY signal and control regions with
