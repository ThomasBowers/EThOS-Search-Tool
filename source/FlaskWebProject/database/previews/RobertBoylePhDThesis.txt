Robert A. Boyle PhD thesis
Both the academic and the fiction element of the thesis concerns events in the Soviet Union and
elsewhere in Europe in the 1930s. The first element informs the second. The academic portion is
based on the first Soviet Writers Congress of 1934, the only such gathering allowed by Stalin in his
lifetime and an event following which many of its delegates were murdered. Primary research
sources include the stenographic verbatim record of the Congress itself and an addendum consisting
of biographical material published by the Writers Union of the USSR in 1990 as Russian
Communism tottered towards its end. This part of the thesis examines aspects of Soviet reality
against the background of the Purges, and includes consideration of the writers world, the
significance of the Red Army to literary life, the position of foreigners and the doctrine of Socialist
Realism, officially sanctified at the Congress. Other sources include memoir, histories of the period
and material from the Thirties Soviet press.
The fiction element comprises an excerpt from a novel, The Eastern Bow, which takes its title from
Audens poem A Summer Night.  It is a story of espionage set in Moscow, Paris and London from
1937 to 1939. The plot involves the writing of a book in Russia by an unknown writer of genius
who tells the truth about Stalin, the Purges and what the Revolution has become  a perversion of its
earlier ideals. The secret police, the NKVD, hunt for the book, its author and all connected with it.
This sub-plot combines with another centred in London and Paris in which a Soviet spy within MI6
is also being sought by elements within British intelligence. The two strands combine in France at
the climax of the novel.
