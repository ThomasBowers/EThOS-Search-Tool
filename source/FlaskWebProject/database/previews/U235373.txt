RE-INTERPRETING THE SOVIET SYSTEM: 
Leninism-Stalinism has been conceived as part of Marxism as a political ideology.
However, both the crisis and collapse of the Soviet system have led to a reconsideration of the
fundamental theoretical grounds upon which the practices of the Leninist-Stalinist state were
premised. This thesis is an attempt to redefine the nature of the Soviet state in its Leninist-
Stalinist dimension. The ultimate aim of this work is to prove that the equation Marxism =
Leninism = Stalinism is debatable. In doing so, I start by investigating Lenins work and its
impact on the future of socialism in the Soviet state. I will also argue that the authoritarian
state which emerged from the Russian Civil War resulted in the Stalin tyranny (I dub it
leviathanism). The method of approach I adopt in this thesis is political-philosophical. I argue
that the theoretical father of the Soviet state was Thomas Hobbes rather than Karl Marx. In
arguing so, I mainly focus on aspects in Hobbess leviathan theory which coalesce with the
political practices from 1917 to the 1930s. Adopting such a method, I seek to challenge the
dominant Continuity thesis which argues that the Soviet practice was but a logical
application of Marxian theory. I challenge such a thesis by arguing that Leninism-Stalinism
was an autholitarian (both authoritarian and totalitarian) system which, like Hobbess
sovereign, was concerned more with the consolidation of the state rather than 'smashing it.
