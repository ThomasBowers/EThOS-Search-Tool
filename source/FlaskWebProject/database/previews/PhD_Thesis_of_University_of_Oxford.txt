Advanced Accelerator Interaction
In order to further probe our understanding of the structure of matter and
the universe, physicists constantly strive to create particle colliders that
reach higher energies and luminosities. Improved technologies can partly
help to fulfil these goals, however, novel experimental interaction region
(EIR) optics and methods are also essential to this cause.
This thesis covers several optics issues and solutions applicable to the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC), its High Energy (HE-LHC) upgrade as well
as the Future Circular Collider (FCC-hh). A key tool presented in this
thesis is an optimisation method to produce short final focus triplets that
produce large integrated gradients whilst having an aperture sufficiently
large to sustain the beams and radiation shielding.
The optimisation method uses a thin lens solution as a first approximation
for the required quadrupole strength. This solution is outlined in the
thesis, it has a large range of potential applications. This is demonstrated
by using it to optimise the dynamic aperture of the Nuclotron-based Ion
Collider fAcility (NICA), which is severely impacted by quadrupole fringe
field effects.
An optimised triplet for the FCC-hh is integrated into the EIR and the
resulting optics as well as the general impact it has on the machine is
presented in this thesis. It also presents how the LHC EIR can be modified
for the HE-LHC, including the implementation of an optimised triplet.
Dynamic aperture studies of the HE-LHC with triplet field errors were
also performed in the scope of this work.
Finally, a ballistic alignment optics for the LHC will be presented as well
as a method that uses singular value decomposition to measure the offset
of modulated quadrupoles. It will also be illustrated how this method can
be used to improve the accuracy to optics measurements. These efforts
can be used to improve the stability and luminosity of the LHC.
