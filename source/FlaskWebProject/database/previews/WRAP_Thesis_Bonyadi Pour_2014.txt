Nitrogen availability is central to global food security. Understanding how
plants respond to nitrogen could help develop crops with improved nitrogen
use. This study aims to investigate how lateral root (LR) and nodule
development are balanced in response to low (0.1 mM) and high (5 mM)
NH4NO3 concentrations in the model legume Medicago truncatula var.
Jemalong A17 using phenotypic and gene regulatory network analysis.
High concentrations of NH4NO3 have an inhibitory effect on nodulation.
The phenotypic measurements of root architecture of A17 in response to
NH4NO3 and rhizobia showed that at high NH4NO3 rhizobia affected LR
development. Total root size was less (P < 0.05) in rhizobia inoculated
samples compared to the absence of rhizobia. This was due to a shorter
primary root and less number of LRs. Whole genome profiling of early (2 and
6 hour) root responses to high NH4NO3 and rhizobia identified 4793 genes
that were differentially expressed (significance cutoff of P<0.05). The early (2
and 6 h) responses to high NH4NO3 were mainly independent of the rhizobia
effect and N-induction especially at 2 h time point was the predominant
response. Some of the components of the autoregulation of nodulation (AON)
pathway are also involved in LR development. The sunn-1 mutant is impaired
in correct AON signals that lead to hypernodulation with short LRs at low N.
