Re-constructing the past in post-genocide Rwanda: an archaeological contribution
A particular version of Rwandas pre-colonial Iron Age past was constructed during
colonial rule and influenced by a racial world-view. This ethnicised and racialised
past was used by successive Rwandan rulers to divide the population along
newcomer/latecomer lines and eventually became a central tenet of the propaganda
that contributed to the genocide in Rwanda in 1994. More recently this racial
presentation of Rwandas past has since been successfully deconstructed by social
historians such as Mamdani (2002), Chrtien (2003), Eltringham (2004) Vansina
(2004 and Newbury (2009), and has been shown to be a heavily biased construction
based on colonial values. Yet, the ethno-racial presentation of the past continues to
be problematic for history education in Rwanda.
This thesis follows on from the work of these authors. It suggests that archaeology
can usefully engage with contemporary political contexts, involving the
deconstruction and reconstruction of Rwandas pre-colonial past in a climate of
reconciliation. Following this introduction this thesis explores the concept of ethnicity
in relation to Rwandan archaeology before reconsidering the tangible evidence for the
Iron Age in Rwanda through a critical review of the existing literature. Furthermore,
through the application of a politically aware and sensitive theoretical and
methodological framework, this thesis explores non-ethno-racial historical narratives
in pre-colonial Rwanda through a new body of archaeological data generated during
twelve months of recent fieldwork in southern, central and northern Rwanda. Finally
this thesis concludes with a summary of the archaeological outcomes of this research
and some speculation on future research directions.
