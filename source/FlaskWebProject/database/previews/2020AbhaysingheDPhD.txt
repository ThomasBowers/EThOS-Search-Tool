Searches for new non-resonant phenomena in high-mass dilepton final states with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider
A search for new physics with non-resonant signals in dielectron and dimuon fi-
nal states in mass ranges above 2 TeV is presented. The data, corresponding to
an integrated luminosity of 139 fb1, were recorded by the ATLAS experiment
in protonproton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV during Run-2
of the Large Hadron Collider. A data-driven background extrapolation pro-
cedure is utilised to model the contribution from background processes. The
benchmark signal model considered is the four-fermion contact-interaction,
which results in an enhancement of the dilepton event rate at the TeV mass
scale. No significant deviation from the expected background is observed in
data. Observed and expected 95% CL limits on the contact interaction energy
scale reach 35.8 TeV and 37.6 TeV, respectively. In addition, 95% CL limits
on the number of events and visible cross section times branching fraction for
new physics processes are provided.
