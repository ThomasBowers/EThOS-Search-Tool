The increased presence of religious diversity among the population of the United
Kingdom, particularly over the past century, is particularly noticeable through
population studies such as the national census, and tangible signs including the increase
in public celebrations of religious festivals, the increase in the presence of religious
dress and food, and the increase in construction of religious architecture for faiths other
than the historic religion of Christianity. This change in the United Kingdom signifies
the need to assess and understand attitudes toward this evident religious diversity among
young people living in the United Kingdom.
This dissertation is contextualised and conducted through a studentship role on the
Young Peoples Attitudes Toward Religious Diversity Project, funded by the
AHRC/ESRC as part of the Religion and Society Programme, conducted by the
Warwick Religions and Education Research Unit. This mixed methods project employed
quantitative methods to profile students aged 13- to 15-years in the different nations and
school types of the United Kingdom, alongside findings from qualitative focus group
interviews among 13- to 16 year-old students. The findings draw two conclusions; first,
that attitudes toward religious diversity vary according to nation, with students in
London and Northern Ireland exhibiting signs of particular difference in attitudes from
the students in the other nations of the United Kingdom; and second, that attitudes
toward religious diversity vary according to school type.
The mixed methodology of the research in the setting of the United Kingdom, the
comparison of nations and school types, and the large scale on which the research was
conducted all offer an innovative contribution to scholarship within the field of the
social scientific study of religion. The conclusions also contribute to a better
understanding of the national contexts of the United Kingdom and the different values
which the different methods of educating young people in the United Kingdom can
promote.
