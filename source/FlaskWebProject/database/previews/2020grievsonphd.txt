Time-of-flight spectrometry of the 
The identification and characterisation of nuclear material is important for
a number of security, safeguards and verification purposes. Nuclides
susceptible to nuclear fission produce a characteristic energy distribution of
fission neutrons, known as the Prompt Fission Neutron Spectrum (PFNS). The
energy distribution of the PFNS can be indicative of the material under
observation; the measurement of the energy spectrum of neutrons however is
notoriously difficult, due to the stochastic manner in which they interact with
radiation instrumentation. Time of flight (TOF) spectrometry however is one
way of deterministically measuring the neutron energy.
This research has used a variety of the associated particle TOF
technique, to perform real time TOF spectrometry of fission nuclides with a
small-scale portable set up,  triggering on the  prompt fission gamma
emission. In order to conduct this, the low energy threshold of EJ-309 has
been determined experimentally via monoenergetic neutron irradiations to be
0.75 MeV, and efficiency curves have been fitted to these data to ensure self-
consistency.
The TOF spectrometry system has been developed and used  to measure
the prompt neutron energy spectrum of 252Cf and 244Cm, the latter of which
has never been explored in this way. The Maxwellian fission spectrum has
been fitted to the PFNS of 244Cm with a parameter T= 1.33 MeV (0.7) and the
Watt spectrum has been fitted with parameters of a=0.918 and b=1.151.  On
the basis of these measurements it is thought that this small scale, real time
TOF spectrometer is able to discriminate between certain nuclides.
