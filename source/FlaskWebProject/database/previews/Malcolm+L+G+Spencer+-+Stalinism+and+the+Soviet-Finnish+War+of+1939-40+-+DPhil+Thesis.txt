Stalinism and the Soviet-Finnish War of 1939-40:  
In both western and Russian historiography the Soviet-Finnish War of 1939-
40 enjoys, at best, only a passing reference in any narrative of the period and is poorly
integrated into existing scholarly analyses of the Soviet regime under Stalin. It is my
contention that this conflict offers an invaluable opportunity to test for continuity and
change in the form and function of the Stalinist system. Between the disastrous efforts
of its forces and the condemnation of the international community, the Kremlin was
confronted with the serious challenge of how to portray the events of the war in the
media, while managing domestic and international opinion over the course of the
fighting.
This thesis examines the extent to which the Soviet regime under Stalin had
the institutions and agents in place at the close of the 1930s to cope with the crisis of
war in Finland; to be in command of the military campaign, while simultaneously
controlling the direction of the official narrative about the fighting; and to censor
conflicting interpretations, experiences and information channels, which might expose
the Red Armys woeful performance on Finnish territory. This mobilisation of press,
propaganda and censorship organs in the face of widespread international
condemnation and domestic disquiet constituted a significant challenge for a regime
still dealing with the sudden reorientation of the Communist International, required
after the Soviet Unions conclusion of a non-aggression treat with Nazi Germany in
August 1939. An international perspective is central to this thesis, with a view
towards assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the public face and private practice
of Soviet information controls.
