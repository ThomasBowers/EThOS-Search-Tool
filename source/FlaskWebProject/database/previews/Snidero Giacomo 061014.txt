W+charm production at LHC
This thesis presents the measurement of the production cross section of a W bo-
son with a single charm quark in 7 TeV proton-proton collisions using the ATLAS
detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The data analysed correspond to an inte-
grated luminosity of 4.6 fb1 and were collected during 2011. This is the first time
that ATLAS data has been used for this particular measurement.
This cross section is of particular interest as a probe of the strange quark density
of the proton. Typically, the strange quark density is considered to be suppressed
relative to that of the other light-quarks in the proton sea. However, some analyses
suggest a more symmetric composition of light-quarks in the proton sea. The
results of this study aim to improve the precision of the determination of the
strange quark density.
The analysis uses events where the W boson decays to a muon and a neutrino. In
such events, the charm quark is identified by its semileptonic decay to a soft muon
within a hadronic jet. The charge correlation between the W boson and the soft
muon is exploited to reduce the backgrounds substantially. The analysis results
are combined with those obtained using additional decay channels.
The measured cross section provides further constraint for the determination of
the strange quark density, advancing the knowledge of the fundamental structure
of the proton. The results are compared with predictions of next-to-leading-order
QCD calculations obtained using various parton distribution function parameter-
isations. Additionally, the ratio of the strange-to-down sea-quark distributions is
determined to be 0.96+0.260.30 at Q
