Money in the Roman Empire from Hadrian to the Severi:  
The present study offers an in-depth examination of the institutional framework
within which money operated as an economic agent in the Roman empire. Analyses focus
on Classical Roman Law as reflected in the writings of Roman jurists from the second
and early-third centuries CE. The legal sources are augmented by documentary materials,
which give independent, albeit sporadic, evidence for actual practice. The thesis follows
current trends in economic history to adopt approaches advanced by New Institutional
Economics (NIE), while generally accepting Keynesian claims for the endogenous nature
of money. Its innovative contribution is in suggesting a complexity-oriented approach to
modelling the behaviour of money in the Roman empire; seeing money as a complex
economic phenomenon, i.e. as a diverse and manifold apparatus which allows for new
patterns of activity to be created by individuals, who self-adjust their use of it to the
continuously evolving system in which they operate.
The thesis is divided into four parts. The first is introductory. The second
concerns the legal institutional framework for economic interaction; with discussions
generally organised according to Roman legal categorisation, and considers
developments in the role allocated to money in legal definitions for exchange transaction.
The third part examines two study-cases of money-related institutions, namely, the
instrument of interest, and interest-bearing deposits, demonstrating how money
stimulated the interconnected dynamics within and between legal traditions operating
under Roman regime. The fourth and last part is dedicated to a more general analysis of
the complex nature of Roman money, attempting to model the historical example of
Roman money with the help of complexity-oriented visualisations.
