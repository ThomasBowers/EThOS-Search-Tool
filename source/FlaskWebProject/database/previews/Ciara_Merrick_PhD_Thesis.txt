This thesis argues the question of peace in Northern Ireland, and perhaps beyond, cannot be founded
on tolerance, equality, or mutual understanding among persons. Peace cannot reside within a horizon of
sameness, whereby bodies are posited as either dualistic or in-common. Both these positions engulf and
dissipate the potential of the in-between as they approach the self and other as known identities
graspable in their entirety. As a scholar inspired by a feminist politics, I approach the question of peace
as an active, transformative making. This does not mean imposing a fixed, timeless or utopian vision of
peace upon empirical reality and critically deconstructing the capacity of the real world to measure up.
Nor does it sacrifice the potential of peace to the non-violent or less-than-violent; peace as an impossible
perfection always-already subsumed by the originary position of conflict and agonism. Rather, I call for
an alternative starting point that holds the capacity to attend to the ethical encounters of peace always-
already respiring throughout the city of Belfast, Northern Ireland.
The starting point I opt for moves with, but also beyond, the thinking of philosopher Luce Irigaray.
Irigaray conceives of the encounter as a relation of differentiation in proximity active in the sharing of
breath. Epistemologically, I trace the movement and materiality of breath through a detailed
ethnographic study of an Irish language centre in Protestant east Belfast. This tracing animates an
understanding of peace as woven from the necessary relationality of autonomous bodies in active
doings that affirm everyday processes of socio-ecological care and reciprocity. The political emphasis
of this thesis cannot be located in a critical assessment of the what is. Rather, it moves with an extant,
ecological weaving of alternative worlds making peace-full, if speculative, futures from within the
immanence of the present.
