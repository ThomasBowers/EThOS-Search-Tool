Microsoft Word - Katy Harsant Thesis Revised Feb 2017.docx
This	project	explores	the	issue	of	selectivity	within	contemporary
international	politics,	particularly	in	relation	to	the	implementation	of	the
United	Nations	Responsibility	to	Protect	principle,	from	a	postcolonial
perspective.	It	argues	that	in	order	to	fully	understand	the	selective
implementation	of	policy	in	contemporary	contexts,	it	is	necessary	to
examine	the	historical	origins	of	the	United	Nations	and	to	highlight	the
institutionalisation	of	postcolonial	privilege	in	international	political
organisations.	Through	the	use	of	archival	data,	it	shows	that	the	United
Nations	is	an	institution	that	has	been	committed	to	the	perpetuation	of
colonial	power	structures	through	the	development	of	new	forms	of
government	and	structures	of	control,	relying	on	problematic	discourses	of
civilisation	and	progress	that	legitimate	a	global	power	structure	that	has
its	roots	in	colonialism.	It	begins	with	the	provision	of	an	alternative
historical	narrative	that	highlights	the	significance	of	colonialism	in	the
founding	of	the	United	Nations	and	that	seeks	to	undermine	the	discourse
of	equality	that	is	frequently	attributed	to	the	organisation.	It	then	moves
on	to	explore	more	concrete	examples	of	the	structures	of	the	United
Nations	that	have	allowed	for	the	continuation	of	colonial	power	relations
before	examining	these	ideas	in	relation	to	the	contemporary	politics	of
intervention,	particularly	focusing	on	the	role	of	the	Security	Council	as	the
locus	of	postcolonial	and	neocolonial	power.
