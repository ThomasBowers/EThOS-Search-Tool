Ameasurement using the ATLAS detector has been made of the fraction of events in proton-
proton collisions at s = 7TeV that do not contain additional jets in the rapidity region
bounded by a di-jet system. This provided a strong test of perturbative QCD in the new
energy regime of the Large Hadron Collider. Additional measurements have been made of
the mean jet multiplicity in the rapidity bounded region and using a variety of different event
selections. These observation were compared to recent next to leading order dijet predictions
produced by POWHEG and a variety of leading order generators.
