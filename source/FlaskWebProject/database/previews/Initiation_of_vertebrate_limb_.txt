Development of paired appendages at appropriate levels along the
body axis characterizes the jawed vertebrate body plan. Molecular networks
that operate within limb buds have received much attention, although very
little is known about how limb budding is initiated. Here I show that beads
soaked in Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and placed in prospective flank of
chick embryos induce formation of ectopic limb buds, which contain their
own signaling regions and develop into complete limbs. Application of FGF
to anterior flank induces ectopic wings, and FGF applied to posterior flank
induces ectopic legs. Hox genes are good candidates for encoding position
in lateral plate mesoderm along the body axis, and thus determining where
limbs form. If particular combinations of Hox gene expression determine
where wings and legs develop, then formation of additional limbs from flank
should involve changes in Hox gene expression which reflect the type of
limb induced. Here I show that the same population of flank cells can be
induced to form wing or leg. Induction of ectopic limbs is accompanied by
specific changes in expression of 3 Hox genes in lateral plate mesoderm
which reproduce, in the flank, expression patterns found at normal limb
levels. Together, these results suggest that local production of FGF may
initiate limb development, and that Hox gene expression may specify limb
position.
Pythons lack forelimbs, have vestigial hindlimbs, and regional
specialization of the axial skeleton has been lost. I have examined patterns
of Hox gene expression in python embryos, and show that the uniform
pattern of vertebrae is associated with uniform Hox gene expression.
Transplantation experiments and analysis of gene expression in python
hindlimbs suggest that limb development is arrested due to failed apical
ridge formation. Absence of a ridge in pythons may result from failure of limb
ectoderm to respond to mesenchymal signals.
