J/  PRODUCTION IN PROTON-PROTON COLLISIONS AT ALICE
A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) studies the strong interaction part
(Quantum Chromo Dynamics) of the Standard Model at the CERN Large Hadron
Collider. ALICE has been designed as a general-purpose heavy-ion detector in order
to explore phenomena of strong interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma
(QGP) at extreme values of energy density and temperature in nucleus-nucleus
collisions.
Results are presented here on the study of J/ production in pp collisions at
ALICE. In particular, a measurement of J/ cross-section at
s = 7 TeV energy has
been performed, together with a study of a possible algorithm to separate primary
J/ from those coming from decays of B hadrons. The validity of this algorithm in
ALICE has been demonstrated using Monte-Carlo samples. The J/ particles have
been searched exclusively in the decay channel J/  e+e. The study focused on
what would be achievable in a period of early running, with integrated luminosity
of L = 1.25 nb1, at a proton-proton centre of mass collision energy of
s = 7 TeV.
