Alpha-decay Spectroscopy and
A detailed nuclear-decay spectroscopy and the -delayed fission of the neutron defi-
cient isotopes 194,196At are presented in this work. An isotopic beam was produced
using the selective Resonance Ionization Laser Ion Source (RILIS) and ISOLDE
mass separator (CERN). The fine-structure  decay of 196At allowed the low-energy
excited states in the daughter nucleus 192Bi to be investigated with new states being
discovered. The -decay branch was also derived with a value of b(
