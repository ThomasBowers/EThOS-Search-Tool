This thesis investigates national identification by applying psychosocial methodology to
discourses produced in Russia during the era of Putinism (2000- ). Existing literature on
post-Soviet Russia frequently claims that at the heart of the nation lies an absence of
symbolic functions or subjective formations with which Russians could identify. At the
same time, there has been relatively little empirical work that seeks to examine national
identification using a psychosocial approach. The study fills this lacuna by looking for
moments of identification across different texts, such as interviews, surveys and media
representations. Using as its starting point the conditions of possibility of post-2000
Russia, the study pays attention to societal shifts and disjunctures, examining how they
are reflected in discursive patterns and formations.
The dissertations empirical element consists of two parts. Through the analysis of
interviews and open-ended surveys, the first part documents respondents ambivalent
relationship with Russia and Russianness, which is characterized by splitting and
disavowal. In the second part, the study deploys a case study approach. The first case
study focuses on discourses of rejection and (dis)identification as featured in the Russian
publics responses to Pussy Riot. It concludes that in their policing of Russianness and
the demarcation of features deemed undesirable as embodied by the group, participants
in the debate have found ways of both shifting the threat Pussy Riot represents, and also
of once again enjoying the nation. The second case study examines discourses that seek
to elicit identification in the populace via representational mechanisms around the figure
of Vladimir Putin. It is argued that the various strategies employed to activate leader love,
ranging from hypermasculinity to hyperrealism, seem to indicate a void at the heart of
the Russian presidents persona and, by extension, his national project, making them
profoundly unstable.
Overall, the thesis provides a rare empirical contribution to the psychosocial study of
national identification.  It addresses the interrelation between imaginary and symbolic
identification and the pivotal role of fantasmatic processes therein. The identifications I
locate in the thesis are precarious and fleeting, speaking of the loss of a fantasy of
national greatness, and of an internalization of images and scenes borrowed from
literature and history. The study also offers a consideration of the implications of such
attachments for Russian society, thus providing further illustration of the
interdependence of the psychic and the social.
