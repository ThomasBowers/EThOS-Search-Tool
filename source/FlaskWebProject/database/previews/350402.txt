COMPONENT FRACTIONATION OF GRAIN LEGUME FLOURS 
Data obtained using cowpea (Vigna unguiculata, L. fialp), to validate
the equipment used for air classification showed that the feed rate of
the air classifier (Alpine iOOMZR) and flour moisture content influenced
fines yield.
A calibration curve for the determination of separation cut size for
17 settings of the air classifier, was derived from Coulter counter
particle-size analysis of matched pairs of fines and coarse fractions.
One other variety-of cowpea and two varieties each of fababean
(Vicia faba, L. ) and pigeonpea (Cajanus cajans, L. ) were also air-
classified at selected separation. cut sizes. The protein content of the
fines decreased, as separation cut sizeincreased, fababean giving the
greatest (23 to 42%) and, cowpea the lowest (0.2 to 16%) protein shifts.
Light microscopy showed that fababean flour contained a high proportion
of large starch granules (> llUm) and cowpea-flours contained a high
proportion of small starch granules (:  3.5pm). Large starch granules
were excluded from the fines, whereas small starch granules entered the
fines, acting as diluents to the protein. This was confirmed by starch
analysis. Thus, starch-granule-size distribution was found to be a
primary determinant of the suitability for air classification, of the
starclVlegumes studied.
The crude fibre content of the fines was significantly lower than
the whole flourfor fababean and pigeonpea, but not for cowpea, whereas,
the indications were, that hemicellulose fractionated into the fines of
all the air-classified legume flours, excepting one variety of pigeonpea.
Oligosaccharides concentrated in the finesfor flours of fababean and
pigeonpea, but not of cowpea. Ash showed no difference in the fines
of any of the legumes, compared with the whole flour, while the fate of
sucrose was not clearly established.
This thesis describes these and related investigations.
