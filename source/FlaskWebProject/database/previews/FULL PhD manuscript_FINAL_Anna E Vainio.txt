"They don't understand how we feel" 
This thesis presents a critical investigation into the community-based approaches on post-disaster
recovery, approaching the subject through the case of Japan after the 2011 Great East Japan
Earthquake and Tsunami. Community-based approaches form a part of the general participatory
turn over the last decades, with the purpose of engaging citizens into decision-making processes by
following four key principles: participation, empowerment, resilience and proximity. The popularity
of these approaches has given rise to their status as the global 'best practice' in the field of
development, and post-disaster recovery more specifically, thus warding further attention and
investigation.
Despite the popularity of these approaches, I will show how community-based approaches often
lead to inconsistent outcomes, and communal dissatisfaction toward the processes themselves
remain prevalent. In Tohoku, this dissatisfaction was emphatically articulated by majority of the
participants through the utterance kimochi ga wakaranai (they don't understand how we feel). The
thesis therefore asks, why does dissatisfaction remain rife despite the adoption of community-
based recovery in Tohoku? While many authors propose that this dissatisfaction is primarily a
procedural problem leading from a gap between theory and practice, I argue that the problem is
related to the epistemological and methodological starting points of recovery that divide recovery
and trajectories for the future into endogenous and exogenous domains and discourses.
Where the exogenous discourse of the authorities emerged from motivations to understand how
this disaster was able to take place and how in the recovery vulnerabilities that led to its onset could
be minimised, for the locals it was the affective intensities of their personal experiences and
intimate daily existence within the post-disaster landscape that drove their understanding of the
events and desired shape for the future of their communities. Through the ethnographic data
analysis, the research finds the dominant exogenous discourses did not resonate with their localised
daily experience of the recovery, with the discrepancy in the visions creating tensions and
dissatisfaction toward the recovery process and paradoxically distancing the communities from the
'community-based' recovery.
