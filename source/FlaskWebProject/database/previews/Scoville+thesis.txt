Searching for New Particles at the Large Hadron Collider: Theory and Methods for Extradimensional Supersymmetry
The hierarchy problem of the electroweak scale is an intriguing puzzle which can
conceivably be solved during upcoming runs of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Super-
symmetry (SUSY) is an attractive potential solution to this problem, though the fact that
no supersymmetric particles have been discovered thus far raises fine tuning of most mod-
els to O(1%). Extradimensional SUSY is especially interesting in light of this fact since
certain models are easier to reconcile with LHC data. This thesis discusses two differ-
ent extradimensional SUSY scenarios: auto-concealment and Maximally Natural SUSY
(MNSUSY). The auto-concealment mechanism applies when the lightest ordinary super-
symmetric particle (LOSP), a brane localized state, promptly decays to the Kaluza-Klein
(KK) tower of a bulk lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). This dynamically realizes
the compression mechanism for hiding SUSY as decays into the more numerous heavier
KK LSP states are favored. LHC limits on LOSP squarks weaken to . 450 GeV while
limits on LOSP right-handed sleptons evaporate. Slepton searches perform poorly in this
case because LHC analyses are blind to compressed slepton spectra. To help fill this
gap, this thesis presents a monojet-like search sensitive to the very compressed range
3 GeV < ml  m01 < 24 GeV. The analysis should allow LHC14 with 100 fb
